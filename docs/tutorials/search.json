The database integrates our proprietary Ligand-Receptor pairs combined with annotations from Ensembl BioMart, UniProt, PubMed, and other public resources.\n\nKey features demonstrated in this tutorial include:\nFlexible multi-gene search: Query one or more genes to identify ligand–receptor pairs and their orthologs.\nCross-species ortholog mapping: Select your model organism to explore orthologous interactions across human and supported species.\nInteractive data exploration: Sort, and customize table views directly in the browser.\nBulk versioned data downloads: Access complete, date-stamped datasets for each species, ensuring reproducibility and historical reference.\nEvidence tracking: Link to supporting literature (PubMed) and functional annotations.\nThis tutorial is structured into self-contained modules so you can quickly locate the information you need—whether you are a new user looking for basic navigation help or an experienced researcher exploring advanced search and download features.\nTo learn more about the database, visit the ConnectomeDB documentation.

Additional species-specific databases may be incorporated in the future to further validate orthologs. For this reason, some columns in the species-specific tables—such as “Ligand XX ID” and “Receptor XX ID”—are currently empty and represented by “-”.\nThe mapping preserves 1:1 orthologs where possible.

The search will return ligand–receptor pairs that match any of the specified genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, entering “calr,ERBB2” or “CALR, erbb2” will return all ligand–receptor pairs involving either CALR or ERBB2 The search bar is not case sensitive and will match gene symbols regardless of capitalization. In addition, Human gene symbols are appended to the other 13 species tables, so you can search for the ortholog human genes in any species table when available. You can also search using any aliases for the species of interest or its human ortholog.\n\n\nView the results: The Pair-list view table will display all ligand–receptor pairs that match the specified gene symbols. Each row represents a unique ligand–receptor interaction, with columns providing detailed information about the ligands, receptors, species, and evidence supporting the interaction.\nSort and customize the table: You can sort the results by clicking on the column headers, and customize the view by selecting which columns to display. This allows you to focus on the most relevant information for your research.\nDownload the results (optional): If you want to download the filtered results, you can do so directly by the following steps:\n\n\nClick on the Select All Filtered(XX) button to select all rows that match your search criteria. You can undo this action by clicking the Deselect All) button. If you do not want to select all and only want to download specific rows, you can select them manually by clicking the checkbox in the beginning of each row in the Select column. Use the information XX rows selected on the top right corner of the table to confirm how many rows you have selected. You can also confirm the rows selected at the bottom left corner of the table if there are more than 25 rows and is more convenient to look from bottom of the table. \nClick on either CSV or Excel button depending on your preferred format. Results will be downloaded as a CSV or Excel file containing the selected rows and their associated data. Only displayed columns at the time of download will be included in the downloaded file.
