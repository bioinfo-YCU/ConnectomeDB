**Please cite the following papers if you use ConnectomeDB or NATMI in your publication:**

1. [ConnectomeDB2025, a high quality manually curated ligand-receptor database for cell-to-cell communication prediction](), P Liu, S Maezono et al. *Journal Title* **XX (YY)**, ZZZ (2025)  
This work describes ConnectomeDB2025, which is our most current ligand-receptor (LR) pair database and online resource.

2. [Predicting cell-to-cell communication networks using NATMI](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18873-z){target="_blank"}, R Hou, et al. *Nature communications* **11 (1)**, 5011 (2020)  
This study introduces NATMI (Network Analysis Toolkit for Multicellular Interactions) and the ConnectomeDB2020 release.

3. [A draft network of ligandâ€“receptor-mediated multicellular signalling in human](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8866){target="_blank"}, JA Ramilowski, et al. *Nature communications* **6 (1)**, 7866 (2015)  
This is the original resource upon which subsequent ConnectomeDB releases are based, and is widely used by many other LR databases.
