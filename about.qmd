**Understanding how intearcting ligand-receptor (LR) pairs mediate cell-cell communication is essential for advancing biological and medical research. ConnectomeDB, initially released in 2015, is a long term-project that aims to provide comprehensive and highly-accuarte database of interacting LR pairs and analysis tools for studying cell-cell communication in human and other species. Developped by:** [Perkins Systems Biology & Genomics Lab](https://perkins.org.au/research/labs/cancer-program/systems-biology-and-genomics-overview/) & [YCU Bioinformatics Lab](https://www-user.yokohama-cu.ac.jp/~bioinfo/hp/).

## **Try NATMI**

#### **NATMI (Network Analysis Toolkit for Multicellular Interactions)**
<span class="half-break"></span>

**NATMI** is our Python-based toolkit designed for constructing and analyzing multi-cellular communication networks in multiple species. NATMI can use both single-cell and bulk gene expression, as well as proteomic data, to predict cell-to-cell communication at the levels of niches, tissues, and the entire organism.
