## **What is ConnectomeDB?**

**Understanding ligand-receptor (LR)-mediated cell-cell communication is essential for advancing biological and medical research. ConnectomeDB, initially released in 2015, is a comprehensive and highly-accuarte database of interacting LR pairs for studying cell-cell communication in human and other species.**

### ConnectomeDB2025

- newest database and user-friendly free online resource for predicting cell-to-cell communication in multiple species
 - 2,361 manually-curated human LR Interacting Pairs with extensive experimental support from primary literature
 - homologues LR interactions in mouse (~93%) and other selected non-human species (chimpanzee, rat, etc.)
 - exploration and prioritization of LR pairs based on existing evidence and biological relevance
 - easy access to extensive metadata and annotations for 854 Ligand & 700 Receptor genes
 - ideal for discovery of novel therapeutic targets, biomarkers, signaling pathways, and more

## **Try NATMI**

**NATMI** (Network Analysis Toolkit for Multicellular Interactions), is our Python-based toolkit for multi-cellular communication network construction and network analysis of multispecies single-cell and bulk gene expression and proteomic data. NATMI predicts cell-to-cell communication at the level of niches, tissues and organism-wide.
