## **What is ConnectomeDB?**

**Understanding ligand-receptor (LR)-mediated cell-cell communication in homeostasis and disease is essential for advancing biological and medical research. Since its initial release in 2015, we have provided the ConnectomeDB ligand-receptor database and other tools for studying cell-cell communication in human and other species.**

### ConnectomeDB2025

 - comprehensive, highly accurate database and user-friendly online resource for predicting cell-to-cell communication
 - 2,361 high-quality human LR Interacting Pairs with experimental support from primary literature
 - homologues interactions in mouse and other selected non-human species (mouse, rat, etc.)
 - exploration and prioritization of LR pairs based on existing evidence and biological relevance
 - easy access to extensive annotations for 854 Ligand & 700 Receptor genes

## **Try NATMI**

**NATMI** (Network Analysis Toolkit for Multicellular Interactions), is our Python-based toolkit for multi-cellular communication network construction and network analysis of multispecies single-cell and bulk gene expression and proteomic data. It allows prediction of cell-to-cell communication at the level of niches, tissues and organism-wide.
