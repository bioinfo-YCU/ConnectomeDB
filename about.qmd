<span class="half-break"></span>

**Understanding ligand-receptor (LR)-mediated cell-cell communication is essential for advancing biological and medical research. ConnectomeDB, initially released in 2015, is a long term-project that aims to provide comprehensive and highly-accuarte database of interacting LR pairs and analysis tools for studying cell-cell communication in human and other species.** **The resource is developped by**: [Perkins Systems Biology & Genomics Lab](https://perkins.org.au/research/labs/cancer-program/systems-biology-and-genomics-overview/) & [YCU Bioinformatics Lab](https://www-user.yokohama-cu.ac.jp/~bioinfo/hp/).

## **Try NATMI**

**NATMI**  (Network Analysis Toolkit for Multicellular Interactions) is our Python-based toolkit designed for constructing and analyzing multi-cellular communication networks in multiple species. NATMI can use both single-cell and bulk gene expression, as well as proteomic data, to predict cell-to-cell communication at the levels of niches, tissues, and the entire organism.
