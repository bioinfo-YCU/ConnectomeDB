                    <h2>Expression cloning of a human brain neuropeptide Y Y2 receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Molecular pharmacology; 1996</h3>
                    <p>The 36-amino acid peptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY), is a member of a peptide family that includes the endocrine peptides, peptide YY (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY receptors have been broadly subdivided into postsynaptic Y1 receptors and presynaptic Y2 receptors based on the preference of Pro34-substituted analogues for the Y1 receptors and carboxyl-terminal fragments for the Y2. A Y1 receptor has been cloned, and this receptor appears to mediate several effects of NPY, including vasoconstriction and anxiolysis in animal models. We report the cloning of a human brain Y2 receptor from a human brain library. Pools of clones were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, and 125I-PYY binding pools were identified by autoradiography. After a single positive pool was detected in the original screening, a single clone was isolated by four rounds of sequential enrichment. The clone encoded a 381-amino acid protein of the heptahelix (seven TM) type. Amino acid identity of this receptor with the Y1 receptor was 31% overall with 40% identity in the TM regions. Comparison with the human PP1 receptor indicated 33% overall amino acid identity with 42% identity in the TM regions. Pharmacologically, the receptor exhibited high affinity for NPY, PYY, and carboxyl-terminal fragments of NPY and PYY. In addition, Pro34-substituted analogues had very low affinity. With the use of Northern blot analysis, high levels of Y2 mRNA were detected in a variety of brain regions with little expression in peripheral tissues. Thus, the receptor protein has the pharmacological properties and distribution of the human Y2 receptor.</p>

                    <h2>Expression cloning and pharmacological characterization of a human hippocampal neuropeptide Y/peptide YY Y2 receptor subtype.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The pancreatic polypeptide family includes neuropeptide Y (NPY), one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the mammalian nervous system, as well as peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). This peptide family is involved in numerous physiological processes such as memory, pain, blood pressure, appetite, anxiety, and circadian rhythm. Of the multiple Y-type receptors proposed for PP family members, only the Y1 subtype was cloned previously. We now report the isolation of a human Y2 (hhY2) receptor cDNA by expression cloning from a human hippocampal cDNA library, using a 125I-PYY binding assay. hhY2 cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 381 amino acids with low amino acid identity to the human Y1 receptor (31% overall; 41% transmembrane). 125I-PYY binding to transiently expressed hY2 receptors was saturable (pKd = 10.17) and displaceable by human PP family members in rank order: PYY (pKi = 9.47) approximately NPY (pKi = 9.27) >> PP (pKi < 6) and by peptide analogs: NPY2-36 (pKi = 8.80) approximately NPY13-36 (pKi = 8.55) approximately C2-NPY (pKi = 8.54) > NPY26-36 (pKi = 6.51) approximately [Leu31,Pro34]NPY (pKi = 6.23). Human PYY decreased [cAMP] and increased intracellular [Ca2+] in hY2-transfected 293 cells.</p>

                    <h2>Neuropeptide Y receptor subtypes.</h2>
                    <h3>Life sciences; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an amidated 36-amino acid peptide with a wide distribution in the central and peripheral nervous system. It can evoke numerous physiological responses by activating specific receptors. Studies using NPY analogs in various model systems and cell types demonstrate different orders of ligand potency and receptor binding affinity. These studies suggest the existence of multiple subtypes of NPY receptors. NPY has been described to bind to at least three different receptors, Y1, Y2 and Y3. NPY has also been shown to interact with sigma receptor in vivo and in vitro. There are indications that more subtypes might exist. Ligand binding studies reveal that Y1, Y2 and Y3 receptors are all G-protein coupled. It is not yet confirmed whether the sigma receptor that interacts with NPY is G-protein coupled. Some studies show that NPY receptors may interact with other classical receptors, including alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors and cholinergic receptors. In the case of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, the receptor-receptor interaction is possibly via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. NPY receptors are coupled to various signal transduction mechanisms including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, and stimulation or inhibition of increases in intracellular Ca2+. Specific links between individual NPY receptor subtype and a particular signal transduction pathway are not established.</p>

                    <h2>Cloning and functional expression of a cDNA encoding a human type 2 neuropeptide Y receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36-amino acid polypeptide that is widely distributed in the central nervous system and periphery. Pharmacological studies have suggested that there are at least three receptor subtypes, Y1, Y2, and Y3. Cloning of the Y1 subtype has been reported previously. Here we report the isolation by expression cloning of a cDNA encoding a human NPY receptor displaying a pharmacology typical of a Y2 receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA express high affinity binding sites for NPY, peptide YY, and NPY13-36, whereas [Leu31,Pro34]NPY binds with lower affinity. The receptor is 381 amino acids in length and has seven putative transmembrane regions typical of G-protein-coupled receptors. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of this Y2 receptor to that of the human Y1 receptor indicates that the two receptors are 31% identical at the amino acid level. Northern blot analyses reveal a single 4-kilobase mRNA species and indicate that the messenger RNA is present in many areas of the central nervous system. NPY induced calcium mobilization and inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells that stably express the Y2 receptor cDNA, indicating that the recombinant Y2 receptor is functionally coupled to second messenger systems.</p>

                    <h2>Neuropeptide Y receptors as targets for anti-obesity drug development: perspective and current status.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of pharmacology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Neuropeptide Y is a widely distributed neuropeptide that elicits a plethora of physiological effects via interaction with six different receptors (Y(1)-y(6)). Recent attention has focused on the role of neuropeptide Y in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Neuropeptide Y stimulates food intake, inhibits energy expenditure, increases body weight and increases anabolic hormone levels by activating the neuropeptide Y Y(1) and Y(5) receptors in the hypothalamus. Based on these findings, several neuropeptide Y Y(1) and Y(5) receptor antagonists have been developed recently as potential anti-obesity agents. In addition, mice lacking neuropeptide Y, the neuropeptide Y Y(1) receptor or the neuropeptide Y Y(5) receptor have been generated. The data obtained to date with these newly developed tools suggests that neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists, particularly neuropeptide Y Y(1) receptor antagonists, may be useful anti-obesity agents. However, the redundancy of the neurochemical systems regulating energy homeostasis may limit the effect of ablating a single pathway. In addition, patients in whom the starvation response is activated, such as formerly obese patients who have lost weight or patients with complete or partial leptin deficiency, may be the best candidates for treatment with a neuropeptide Y receptor antagonist.</p>
