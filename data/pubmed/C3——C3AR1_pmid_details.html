                    <h2>Identification of a selective nonpeptide antagonist of the anaphylatoxin C3a receptor that demonstrates antiinflammatory activity in animal models.</h2>

                    <p>The anaphylatoxin C3a is a potent chemotactic peptide and inflammatory mediator released during complement activation which binds to and activates a G-protein-coupled receptor. Molecular cloning of the C3aR has facilitated studies to identify nonpeptide antagonists of the C3aR. A chemical lead that selectively inhibited the C3aR in a high throughput screen was identified and chemically optimized. The resulting antagonist, N(2)-[(2,2-diphenylethoxy)acetyl]-L-arginine (SB 290157), functioned as a competitive antagonist of (125)I-C3a radioligand binding to rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells expressing the human C3aR (RBL-C3aR), with an IC(50) of 200 nM. SB 290157 was a functional antagonist, blocking C3a-induced C3aR internalization in a concentration-dependent manner and C3a-induced Ca(2+) mobilization in RBL-C3aR cells and human neutrophils with IC(50)s of 27.7 and 28 nM, respectively. SB 290157 was selective for the C3aR in that it did not antagonize the C5aR or six other chemotactic G protein-coupled receptors. Functional antagonism was not solely limited to the human C3aR; SB 290157 also inhibited C3a-induced Ca(2+) mobilization of RBL-2H3 cells expressing the mouse and guinea pig C3aRS: It potently inhibited C3a-mediated ATP release from guinea pig platelets and inhibited C3a-induced potentiation of the contractile response to field stimulation of perfused rat caudal artery. Furthermore, in animal models, SB 290157, inhibited neutrophil recruitment in a guinea pig LPS-induced airway neutrophilia model and decreased paw edema in a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model. This selective antagonist may be useful to define the physiological and pathophysiological roles of the C3aR.</p>

                    <h2>Selective hexapeptide agonists and antagonists for human complement C3a receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of medicinal chemistry; 2010</h3>
                    <p>Human anaphylatoxin C3a, formed through cleavage of complement protein C3, is a potent effector of innate immunity via activation of its G protein coupled receptor, human C3aR. Previously reported short peptide ligands for this receptor either have low potency or lack receptor selectivity. Here we report the first small peptide agonists that are both potent and selective for human C3aR, derived from structure-activity relationships of peptides based on the C-terminus of C3a. Affinity for C3aR was examined by competitive binding with (125)I-labeled C3a to human PBMCs [corrected], agonist versus antagonist activity measured using fluorescence detection of intracellular calcium, and general selectivity monitored by C3a-induced receptor desensitization. An NMR structure for an agonist in DMSO showed a beta-turn motif that may be important for C3aR binding and activation. Derivatization produced a noncompetitive and insurmountable antagonist of C3aR. Small molecule C3a agonists and antagonists may be valuable probes of immunity and inflammatory diseases.</p>
