                    <h2>Identification and characterization of the murine and human gene encoding the tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrinology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>By screening public databases, we identified human and mouse genomic DNA clones that encode the tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39). The TIP39 precursor is encoded by at least three exons; a noncoding exon U1, exon 1 encoding residues -61 (initiator methionine) to -19 of the leader sequence, and exon 2 encoding residues -18 to -1 and residues +1 to +39. Secreted human TIP39 is identical to the previously isolated bovine TIP39, whereas mouse TIP39 differs by four amino acids. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that TIP39, PTH, and PTHrP may have evolved from a common ancestor. Synthetic human and mouse TIP39 showed indistinguishable potencies [EC(50): 0.54 (human) vs. 0.74 nM (mouse)] at the human PTH2-receptor stably expressed in LLCPK(1) cells; furthermore, TIP-(9-39) was an inhibitor of cAMP accumulation stimulated by either [Tyr(34)]PTH(1-34)amide or human/bovine TIP39. In the mouse, an approximately 4.5-kb mRNA encoding TIP39 was identified by Northern blot analysis in testis and, less abundantly, in liver and kidney, whereas other tissues revealed additional smaller transcripts. In situ hybridizations revealed TIP39 expression in seminiferous tubuli and several brain regions, including nucleus ruber, nucleus centralis pontis, and nucleus subparafascicularis thalami. Because PTH2 receptor expression was previously shown to be highest in brain, pancreas, and testis, our findings are consistent with the notion that TIP39 is a neuropeptide which may also have a role in spermatogenesis.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular determinants of tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) selectivity for the parathyroid hormone-2 (PTH2) receptor. N-terminal truncation of TIP39 reverses PTH2 receptor/PTH1 receptor binding selectivity.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) and the parathyroid hormone-2 (PTH2) receptor form part of an extended family of related signaling molecules that includes the PTH1 receptor, which responds to PTH and PTH-related protein. TIP39 does not appreciably activate the PTH1 receptor, but in this study it is shown to bind the receptor with moderate affinity (59 nm). In this study, we investigated the molecular determinants of both ligand and receptor for the PTH2 receptor selectivity of TIP39 and quantitatively evaluated the role of molecular elements in the binding of TIP39 to the PTH2 and PTH1 receptors. A chimeric receptor composed of the N-terminal extracellular domain of the PTH1 receptor and the remainder (juxtamembrane domain) of the PTH2 receptor (P2-NP1) was fully activated by TIP39 (E(max) = 98% of the rPTH-(1-34), E(max), EC(50) = 2.0 nm). This receptor chimera bound TIP39 with an equivalent affinity to the wild-type PTH2 receptor (2. 3 and 2.0 nm, respectively). The reciprocal chimeric receptor (P1-NP2) was not activated by TIP39 and bound the ligand with an affinity equivalent to that of the PTH1 receptor. Thus, the juxtamembrane receptor domain specifies the signaling and binding selectivity of TIP39 for the PTH2 receptor over the PTH1 receptor. Removing six N-terminal residues of TIP39 eliminated activation of the PTH2 receptor and reduced binding affinity 70-fold. In contrast, this truncation increased affinity for the PTH1 receptor 10-fold, reversing the PTH2/PTH1 receptor binding selectivity and resulting in a high affinity interaction of TIP-(7-39) with the PTH1 receptor (6 nm). These findings can be explained by a strong interaction between the N-terminal region of TIP39 and the juxtamembrane domain of the PTH2 receptor, with the corresponding domain of the PTH1 receptor acting as a selectivity barrier against high affinity binding of TIP39. As a result, TIP-(7-39) is a highly potent, selective antagonist for the PTH1 receptor.</p>

                    <h2>Regions in rat and human parathyroid hormone (PTH) 2 receptors controlling receptor interaction with PTH and with antagonist ligands.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 2001</h3>
                    <p>The parathyroid hormone (PTH) 2 receptor is potently activated by tuberoinfundibular peptide (TIP39). Rat and human PTH2 receptors differ considerably in their PTH responsiveness. PTH weakly stimulates cAMP accumulation via the rat receptor, and here we show it did not detectably increase intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and bound with low affinity (450 nM). For the human PTH2 receptor PTH was a full agonist for increasing cAMP, a partial agonist for increasing [Ca2+]i, and bound with high affinity (18 nM). In addition, the antagonists PTH(7-34) and TIP(7-39) bound with 10- to 49-fold lower affinity to the rat receptor. We investigated the molecular basis of differential PTH and antagonist interaction with human and rat PTH2 receptors by using chimeric human/rat PTH2 receptors. PTH cAMP-signaling efficacy (Emax) was determined by extracellular loop (EL) 1 and a region including EL2 and EL3. The N-terminal domain determined PTH binding selectivity at the inactive receptor state. Multiple regions throughout the receptor are required for the PTH-PTH2 receptor complex to adopt a high-affinity active state: inserting the rat receptor's N-terminal domain, EL1 or EL2/3, into the human receptor increased PTH's EC50 and reciprocal exchanges did not reduce EC50. This suggests the global receptor conformation prevents the rat receptor from adopting a high-affinity state when in complex with PTH. N-terminal ligand truncation, producing the antagonists PTH(7-34) and TIP(7-39), altered ligand interaction with the membrane-embedded domain of the receptor, eliminating EL2/3 as a specificity determinant and lowering binding affinity. These insights should contribute to the development of a high-affinity PTH2 receptor antagonist, for investigating the receptor's physiological role.</p>
