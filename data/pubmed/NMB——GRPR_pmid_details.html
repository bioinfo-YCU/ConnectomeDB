                    <h2>Bombesin, neuromedin B and neuromedin C interact with a common rat pancreatic phosphoinositide-coupled receptor, but are differentially regulated by guanine nucleotides.</h2>
                    <h3>The Biochemical journal; 1991</h3>
                    <p>Bombesin (BB), neuromedin C (NMC) and neuromedin B (NMB) stimulated amylase secretion to similar maximum levels, with EC50 values (concentrations causing 50% of maximum effect) of 0.2, 0.3 and 2 nM respectively. Treatment of pancreatic acini with BB or NMB (10 nM) for 30 min resulted in cross-desensitization of secretory responses to subsequent BB and NMB, but not to acetylcholine, which suggests that NMB and BB activate the same receptor. BB, NMC and NMB stimulated production of similar maximum amounts of inositol mono-, bis- and tris-phosphates, with EC50 values of 3, 5 and 141 nM respectively. The bombesin receptor antagonist [Leu13-psi(CH2NH)Leu14]BB inhibited stimulation of amylase secretion and inositol phosphate formation by BB, NMC and NMB. Binding of 125I-labelled gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP; 200 pM) to rat pancreatic membranes at 22 degrees C was inhibited with relative potencies and IC50 (concn. causing 50% of maximal inhibition; nM) as follows: NMC (0.4) = BB (0.5) greater than NMB (1.8 = GRP (2.6). IC50 values for BB, NMC and NMB inhibition of 125I-GRP binding to intact acini were 5-, 19- and 68-fold higher than their respective values in membranes. The guanine nucleotide analogue guanosine 5'-[beta gamma-imido]triphosphate (Gpp[NH]p) produced rightward shifts of NMC and NMB competition curves by 3.5- and 16-fold respectively, but had little effect on the BB and GRP curves. Elevation of the temperature to 37 degrees C or inclusion of NaCl (40 mM) produced quantitatively similar effects to those of Gpp[NH]p. In the presence of both NaCl and Gpp[NH]p the affinities of peptides for membrane receptors were similar to those for intact cells. Modulation of NMB competition curves by Gpp[NH]p was not attenuated by prior treatment of acini with activated pertussis toxin. These results suggest that BB, NMB and NMC stimulate pancreatic secretion by interaction with a common phosphoinositide-linked receptor. Differences in guanine nucleotide regulation suggest that secretagogue-induced receptor-protein interactions may not be identical for NMB and BB.</p>

                    <h2>Comparative pharmacology of the nonpeptide neuromedin B receptor antagonist PD 168368.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 1999</h3>
                    <p>The mammalian peptide neuromedin B (NMB) and its receptor are expressed in a variety of tissues; however, little is definitively established about its physiological actions because of the lack of potent, specific antagonists. Recently, the peptoid PD 168368 was found to be a potent human NMB receptor antagonist. Because it had been shown previously that either synthetic analogs of bombesin (Bn) or other receptor peptoid or receptor antagonists function as an antagonist or agonist depends on animal species and receptor subtype studied, we investigated the pharmacological properties of PD 168368 compared with all currently known Bn receptor subtypes (NMB receptor, gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, Bn receptor subtype 3, and Bn receptor subtype 4) from human, mouse, rat, and frog. In binding studies, PD 168368 had similar high affinities (K(i) = 15-45 nM) for NMB receptors from each species examined, 30- to 60-fold lower affinity for gastrin-releasing peptide receptors, and >300-fold lower affinity for Bn receptor subtype 3 or 4. It inhibited NMB binding in a competitive manner. PD 168368 alone did not stimulate increases in either intracellular calcium concentration or [(3)H]inositol phosphates in any of the cells studied but inhibited NMB-induced responses with equivalent potencies in cells containing NMB receptors. PD 168368 was only minimally soluble in water. When hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin rather than dimethyl sulfoxide was used as the vehicle, both the affinity and the antagonist potency of PD 168368 were significantly greater. The results demonstrate that PD 168368 is a potent, competitive, and selective antagonist at NMB receptors, with a similar pharmacology across animal species. PD 168368 should prove useful for delineating the biological role of NMB and selectively blocking NMB signaling in bioassays and as a lead for the development of more selective nonpeptide antagonists for the NMB receptor.</p>

                    <h2>Expression and characterization of cloned human bombesin receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Molecular pharmacology; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Little is known about the pharmacology or cell biology of human bombesin (Bn) receptors, because they are usually present at low levels and both subtypes are frequently present in the same tissues. Human gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptors (huGRP-R) and human neuromedin B (NMB) receptors (huNMB-R) were stably transfected into BALB/3T3 fibroblasts. Both receptor types were glycosylated, with 35% of the huGRP-R and 38% of the huNMB-R representing carbohydrate residues. The extent of glycosylation of the transfected huGRP-R was the same as that seen in the human glioblastoma cell line U-118. Radiolabeled agonist ligands were rapidly internalized, whereas noninternalized ligand readily dissociated in a temperature-dependent fashion. The affinities of various agonists for binding to the huGRP-R were Bn (Ki = 1.4 +/- 0.2 nM) = 4 x GRP = 300 x NMB. In contrast, affinities for the huNMB-R were NMB (Ki = 8.1 +/- 5.2 nM) = 4 x Bn = 600 x GRP. [F5-D-Phe6,D-Ala11]Bn(6-13)methyl ester was the most potent huGRP-R antagonist, whereas D-Nal-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Nal-NH2 was the most potent huNMB-R antagonist. Agonist binding to either receptor type caused activation of phospholipase C and increased cellular [3H]inositol phosphate levels. GRP was potent at increasing [3H]inositol phosphate generation in cells expressing the huGRP-R (EC50 = 13.6 +/- 1.3 nM), whereas NMB was similarly potent when acting upon cells expressing the huNMB-R (EC50 = 9.3 +/- 1.4 nM). However, neither receptor type, when stimulated with agonist, caused an increase in cAMP levels. These data show that stably transfected huGRP-R exhibit similar pharmacology for agonists and antagonists, are appropriately glycosylated, and function similarly with respect to their ability to alter biological activity, compared with natively expressed receptors. Minimal native huNMB-R data are available for comparison, but in general the huNMB-R is similar to the rat NMB receptor in its pharmacology and cell biology.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacology and selectivity of various natural and synthetic bombesin related peptide agonists for human and rat bombesin receptors differs.</h2>
                    <h3>Peptides; 2011</h3>
                    <p>The mammalian bombesin (Bn)-receptor family [gastrin-releasing peptide-receptor (GRPR-receptor), neuromedin B-receptor (NMB receptor)], their natural ligands, GRP/NMB, as well as the related orphan receptor, BRS-3, are widely distributed, and frequently overexpressed by tumors. There is increased interest in agonists for this receptor family to explore their roles in physiological/pathophysiological processes, and for receptor-imaging/cytotoxicity in tumors. However, there is minimal data on human pharmacology of Bn receptor agonists and most results are based on nonhuman receptor studies, particular rodent-receptors, which with other receptors frequently differ from human-receptors. To address this issue we compared hNMB-/GRP-receptor affinities and potencies/efficacies of cell activation (assessing phospholipase C activity) for 24 putative Bn-agonists (12 natural, 12 synthetic) in four different cells with these receptors, containing native receptors or receptors expressed at physiological densities, and compared the results to native rat GRP-receptor containing cells (AR42J-cells) or rat NMB receptor cells (C6-glioblastoma cells). There were close correlations (r=0.92-99, p<0.0001) between their affinities/potencies for the two hGRP- or hNMB-receptor cells. Twelve analogs had high affinities (≤ 1 nM) for hGRP receptor with 15 selective for it (greatest=GRP, NMC), eight had high affinity/potencies for hNMB receptors and four were selective for it. Only synthetic Bn analogs containing β-alanine(11) had high affinity for hBRS-3, but also had high affinities/potencies for all GRP-/hNMB-receptor cells. There was no correlation between affinities for human GRP receptors and rat GRP receptors (r=0.131, p=0.54), but hNMB receptor results correlated with rat NMB receptor (r=0.71, p<0.0001). These results elucidate the human and rat GRP-receptor pharmacophore for agonists differs markedly, whereas they do not for NMB receptors, therefore potential GRP-receptor agonists for human studies (such as Bn receptor-imaging/cytotoxicity) must be assessed on human Bn receptors. The current study provides affinities/potencies on a large number of potential agonists that might be useful for human studies.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of putative GRP- and NMB-receptor antagonist's interaction with human receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Peptides; 2009</h3>
                    <p>The mammalian bombesin (Bn) peptides neuromedin B (NMB) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) actions are mediated by two receptors (NMB-receptor, GRP-receptor) which are widely distributed in the GI tract and CNS. From primarily animal studies NMB/GRP-receptor activation has physiological/pathophysiological effects in the CNS and GI tract including stimulating of growth of cancers and normal tissues. Whereas these Bn-receptors' effects have been extensively studied in nonhuman cells and animals, little is known of the physiological/pathological role(s) in humans, largely due to lack of potent antagonists. To address this issue we compared NMB/GRP-receptor affinity/potency of 10 chemical classes of putative antagonists (35 compounds) for human Bn-receptors by performing binding studies or assessing abilities to activate hGRP/hNMB-receptor [assessing phospholipase C activation] in four different cells containing native Bn-receptors or transfected receptors. From binding studies 23 were GRP-receptor-preferring, 4 were NMB-receptor, and 8 nonselective. For the hGRP-receptor-preferring analogues none showed hGRP-receptor agonist activity, but 13 were full or partial hNMB-receptor agonists at hNMB-receptors. For hNMB-receptor-preferring analogues none were agonists. Analogue #24 ([(3-Ph-Pr(6)), His(7), d-Ala(11), d-Pro(13), Psi(13-14), Phe(14)]Bn(6-14)NH2) and analogue #7 [d-Phe(6), Leu(13), Psi(CH(2)NH), Cpa(14)]Bn(6-14) were the most potent (0.2-1.4nM) and selective (>10,000-fold) for the hGRP-receptor with analogue #7.5 [d-Tpi(6), Leu(13), Psi(CH2NH), Leu(14)]Bn(6-14)[RC-3095] (0.2-1.4nM) slightly less selective. Analogue #34 (PD168368) had the highest affinity for hNMB-receptor (1.32-1.58nM) and the greatest selectivity (2298-6952-fold) for the hNMB-receptor. These results demonstrate numerous putative hGRP/hNMB-receptor antagonists identified in nonhuman cells and/or animals have agonist activity at the hNMB-receptor, limiting their potential usefulness. However, a number were identified which were potent/selective for human Bn-receptors and should be useful for investigating their roles in human physiological/pathophysiological conditions.</p>
