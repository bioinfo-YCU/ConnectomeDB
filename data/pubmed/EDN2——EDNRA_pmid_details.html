                    <h2>Cloning of a cDNA encoding a non-isopeptide-selective subtype of the endothelin receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature; 1990</h3>
                    <p>Endothelin-1 was initially identified as a 21-residue potent vasoconstrictor peptide produced by vascular endothelial cells, but was subsequently found to have many effects on both vascular and non-vascular tissues. The discovery of three isopeptides of the endothelin family, ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3, each possessing a diverse set of pharmacological activities of different potency, suggested the existence of several different endothelin receptor subtypes. Endothelins may elicit biological responses by various signal-transduction mechanisms, including the G protein-coupled activation of phospholipase C and the activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Thus, different subtypes of the endothelin receptor may use different signal-transduction mechanisms. Here we report the cloning of a complementary DNA encoding one subtype belonging to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA express specific and high-affinity binding sites for endothelins, responding to binding by the production of inositol phosphates and a transient increase in the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+. The three endothelin isopeptides are roughly equipotent in displacing 125I-labelled ET-1 binding and causing Ca2+ mobilization. A messenger RNA corresponding to the cDNA is detected in many rat tissues including the brain, kidney and lung but not in vascular smooth muscle cells. These results indicate that this cDNA encodes a 'nonselective' subtype of the receptor which is different from the vascular smooth muscle receptor.</p>

                    <h2>Distribution and functional significance of the endothelin receptor subtypes in the rat adrenal gland.</h2>
                    <h3>Cell and tissue research; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Endothelins (ET) are a family of vasoactive peptides that act via two subtypes of receptors, named ETA and ETB. ET-1 binds to both ETA and ETB, whereas the isopeptide ET-3 preferentially binds to ETB. The localization of ETA and ETB receptors in the rat adrenal gland and their involvement in the adrenal secretagogue effect of ETs has been studied in vitro. Autoradiographic assessment of the selective displacement of [125I]ET-1, [125I]ET-3 and [125I]BQ-3020 (an ETB agonist) by BQ-123 or BQ-788 (specific antagonists of ETA and ETB, respectively) indicates that the zona glomerulosa and adrenal medulla possess both ETA and ETB, whereas the zona fasciculata/reticularis is exclusively provided with ETB. ET-1, ET-3 and BQ-3020 enhance aldosterone and corticosterone secretion by dispersed cells of the zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata/reticularis, respectively. BQ-123 does not affect the secretagogue action of these three agonists, whereas BQ-788 completely annuls it. ET-1 induces a marked rise in catecholamine release by fragments of the adrenal medulla, and both BQ-123 and BQ-788 partially reverse this effect. ET-3 and BQ-3020 elicit a catecholamine release that is less intense than that produced by ET-1; this response is unaffected by BQ-123 and abolished by BQ-788. Thus, in the rat, the corticosteroid secretagogue effect of ETs seems to be exclusively mediated by the ETB receptor subtype, and the catecholamine secretagogue action by both ETA and ETB. The functional relevance of ETA receptors present in the zona glomerulosa remains to be investigated.</p>

                    <h2>ETA receptor-mediated constrictor responses to endothelin peptides in human blood vessels in vitro.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 1995</h3>
                    <p>1. We have characterized the constrictor endothelin receptors present in human isolated blood vessels using ETA and ETB selective agonists and antagonists. 2. Monophasic dose-response curves were obtained for ET-1 with EC50 values of 6.8 nM in coronary artery, 3.9 nM in internal mammary artery, 17.4 nM in pulmonary artery, 14.5 nM in aorta and 3.2 nM in saphenous vein. In coronary artery, ET-2 was equipotent with ET-1 with an EC50 value of 5.7 nM. The non-selective peptide, sarafotoxin 6b, was 2-3 times less potent than ET-1 but the maximum responses to these two were comparable. 3. In each vessel ET-3 was much less active than ET-1. No response was obtained to ET-3 in aorta and pulmonary artery or in up to 50% of coronary artery, mammary artery and saphenous vein preparations. In those preparations that did respond, dose-response curves were incomplete at 300 nM. Variable contractions were also obtained with the ETB-selective agonist, sarafotoxin 6c (S6c). Where responses were detected, although S6c was more potent than ET-1 (EC50 values of 0.6-1.2 nM), the maximum response produced was always less than 20% of that to ET-1. 4. The synthetic ETB agonists, BQ3020 and [1,3,11,15Ala]-ET-1, were without effect in any of the five blood vessels at concentrations up to 3 microM. 5. ET-1-induced vasoconstriction was blocked by the ETA-selective antagonists, BQ123 and FR139317. Schild-derived pA2 values were 7.0, 7.4 and 6.9 for BQ123 and 7.6, 7.9 and 7.3 for FR139317 in coronary artery, mammary artery and saphenous vein, respectively, consistent with antagonism of ETA receptors. Slopes of the Schild regressions were not significantly different from one. Comparable values of pA2 were estimated for 3ftM BQ123 in aorta (7.4+/-0.5) and pulmonary artery (6.9) from the Gaddum-Schild equation.6. In conclusion we have shown that in human isolated blood vessels, ET-1 is more potent than ET-3 suggesting the presence of vasoconstrictor ETA receptors. This is supported by the lack of effect of the ETB agonists, BQ3020 and [1,3,1,1,15Ala]-ET-l and the ability of the ETA antagonists, BQ123 andFR139317 to block ET-1 responses. Some preparations did contract in response to low concentrations of the ETB-selective sarafotoxin 6c but responses were variable and the maximum was always much less than that to ET-1 in the same preparations. Therefore although constrictor ETB receptors were present on the smooth muscle of human blood vessels, vasoconstriction elicited by the endothelin peptides in vitro is via ETA receptor activation.</p>
