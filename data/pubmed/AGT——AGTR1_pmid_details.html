                    <h2>AT1-receptor heterodimers show enhanced G-protein activation and altered receptor sequestration.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature; 2000</h3>
                    <p>The vasopressor angiotensin II regulates vascular contractility and blood pressure through binding to type 1 angiotensin II receptors (AT1; refs 1, 2). Bradykinin, a vasodepressor, is a functional antagonist of angiotensin II (ref. 3). The two hormone systems are interconnected by the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which releases angiotensin II from its precursor and inactivates the vasodepressor bradykinin. Here we show that the AT1 receptor and the bradykinin (B2) receptor also communicate directly with each other. They form stable heterodimers, causing increased activation of G alpha(q) and G alpha(i) proteins, the two major signalling proteins triggered by AT1. Furthermore, the endocytotic pathway of both receptors changed with heterodimerization. This is the first example of signal enhancement triggered by heterodimerization of two different vasoactive hormone receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Tubular expression of angiotensin II receptors and their regulation in IgA nephropathy.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN; 2005</h3>
                    <p>Enhanced renal expression for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is detected in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Previous data showed an altered glomerular expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), suggesting a regulatory response to high intrarenal angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration in IgAN. In this study, the expression and regulation of Ang II receptors were examined in human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) in IgAN. Tubular expression of AT1R and Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) was increased in IgAN. In vitro culture experiment showed that the upregulation of Ang II receptors was not due to the direct effect of IgA but the indirect effect after IgA deposition on human mesangial cell. When PTEC were cultured with conditioned culture medium from human mesangial cells activated with IgA, Ang II production was upregulated, leading to inflammation and apoptosis via the AT1R and AT2R, respectively. Sequential expression of Ang II receptors determined the injury of PTEC induced by mediators in the conditioned medium. The initial interaction between Ang II and AT1R activated both protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, leading to inflammatory responses. This early AT1R-dependent event was followed by upregulation of AT2R expression and continued Ang II release. The interaction between Ang II and AT2R subsequently led to expression of cleaved poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase through downregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The data suggest that appropriate control of Ang II receptor activities in PTEC may ameliorate tubulointerstitial injury in IgAN.</p>

                    <h2>Pressor and renal hemodynamic effects of the novel angiotensin A peptide are angiotensin II type 1A receptor dependent.</h2>
                    <h3>Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979); 2011</h3>
                    <p>Recently, a new derivative of angiotensin (Ang) II, called "Ang A," has been discovered to be present in plasma of healthy humans and, in increased concentrations, in end-stage renal failure patients. The objectives of the study were to investigate the blood pressure and renal hemodynamic responses to Ang A in normotensive and hypertensive rats and in genetically modified mice and the binding properties of Ang A to Ang II type 1 (AT(1)) or Ang II type 2 (AT(2)) receptors. Intravenous and intrarenal administration of Ang A induced dose-dependent pressor and renal vasoconstrictor responses in normotensive rats, which were blocked by the AT(1) receptor antagonist candesartan but were not altered by the AT(2) receptor ligands PD123319, CGP42112A, or compound 21. Similar responses were observed after intravenous administration in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Deletion of AT(1a) receptors in mice almost completely abolished the pressor and renal vasoconstrictor responses to Ang A, indicating that its effects are mediated via AT(1a) receptors. Ang A was less potent than Ang II in vivo. The in vitro study demonstrated that Ang A is a full agonist for AT(1) receptors, with similar affinity for AT(1) and AT(2) receptors as Ang II. Overall, the responses to Ang A and Ang II were similar. Ang A has no physiological role to modulate the pressor and renal hemodynamic effects of Ang II.</p>

                    <h2>Distinction between surmountable and insurmountable selective AT1 receptor antagonists by use of CHO-K1 cells expressing human angiotensin II AT1 receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 1999</h3>
                    <p>1. CHO-K1 cells that were stably transfected with the gene for the human AT1 receptor (CHO-AT1 cells) were used for pharmacological studies of non-peptide AT1 receptor antagonists. 2. In the presence of 10 mM LiCl, angiotensin II caused a concentration-dependent and long-lasting increase of inositol phosphates accumulation with an EC50 of 3.4 nM. No angiotensin II responses are seen in wild-type CHO-K1 cells. 3. [3H]-Angiotensin II bound to cell surface AT1 receptors (dissociates under mild acidic conditions) and is subject to rapid internalization. 4. Non-peptide selective AT1 antagonists inhibited the angiotensin II (0.1 microM) induced IP accumulation and the binding of [3H]-angiotensin II (1 nM) with the potency order: candesartan > EXP3174 > irbesartan > losartan. Their potencies are lower in the presence of bovine serum albumin. 5. Preincubation with the insurmountable antagonist candesartan decreased the maximal angiotensin II induced inositol phosphate accumulation up to 94% and, concomitantly, decreased the maximal binding capacity of the cell surface receptors. These inhibitory effects were half-maximal for 0.6 nM candesartan and were attenuated by simultaneous preincubation with 1 microM losartan indicating a syntopic action of both antagonists. 6. Losartan caused a parallel rightward shift of the angiotensin II concentration-response curves and did not affect the maximal binding capacity. EXP3174 (the active metabolite of losartan) and irbesartan showed a mixed-type behavior in both functional and binding studies. 7. Reversal of the inhibitory effect was slower for candesartan as compared with EXP3174 and irbesartan and it was almost instantaneous for losartan, suggesting that the insurmountable nature of selective AT1 receptor antagonists in functional studies was related to their long-lasting inhibition.</p>

                    <h2>Angiotensin IV is a potent agonist for constitutive active human AT1 receptors. Distinct roles of the N-and C-terminal residues of angiotensin II during AT1 receptor activation.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2002</h3>
                    <p>The octapeptide hormone, angiotensin II (Ang II), exerts its major physiological effects by activating AT(1) receptors. In vivo Ang II is degraded to bioactive peptides, including Ang III (angiotensin-(2-8)) and Ang IV (angiotensin-(3-8)). These peptides stimulate inositol phosphate generation in human AT(1) receptor expressing CHO-K1 cells, but the potency of Ang IV is very low. Substitution of Asn(111) with glycine, which is known to cause constitutive receptor activation by disrupting its interaction with the seventh transmembrane helix (TM VII), selectively increased the potency of Ang IV (900-fold) and angiotensin-(4-8), and leads to partial agonism of angiotensin-(5-8). Consistent with the need for the interaction between Arg(2) of Ang II and Ang III with Asp(281), substitution of this residue with alanine (D281A) decreased the peptide's potency without affecting that of Ang IV. All effects of the D281A mutation were superseded by the N111G mutation. The increased affinity of Ang IV to the N111G mutant was also demonstrated by binding studies. A model is proposed in which the Arg(2)-Asp(281) interaction causes a conformational change in TM VII of the receptor, which, similar to the N111G mutation, eliminates the constraining intramolecular interaction between Asn(111) and TM VII. The receptor adopts a more relaxed conformation, allowing the binding of the C-terminal five residues of Ang II that switches this "preactivated" receptor into the fully active conformation.</p>
