                    <h2>Characterization of the integrin alpha v beta 6 as a fibronectin-binding protein.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1992</h3>
                    <p>Integrins are a complex family of divalent cation-dependent cell adhesion receptors composed of one alpha and one beta subunit noncovalently bound to one another. A subset of integrins contains the alpha v subunit in association with one of several beta subunits (e.g. beta 3, beta 5, beta 1). We have recently identified a novel integrin beta subunit, beta 6, that is present in a number of epithelial cell lines. Using a polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of beta 6, we have now identified the integrin heterodimer, alpha v beta 6, on the surface of two human carcinoma cell lines. Using affinity chromatography of lysates from the pancreatic carcinoma cell line, FG-2, we demonstrate that alpha v beta 6 binds to fibronectin, but not to vitronectin or collagen I. In contrast, the alpha v beta 5 integrin, which is also expressed on FG-2 cells, binds exclusively to vitronectin. Immobilized collagen I does not interact with alpha v integrins, but binds beta 1-containing integrins. Both alpha v beta 6 and alpha v beta 5 are eluted from their respective immobilized ligands by a hexa-peptide containing the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). RGD is highly effective in the presence of Ca2+, somewhat less effective in Mg2+, and virtually inactive in Mn2+. These results suggest that alpha v beta 6 functions as an RGD-dependent fibronectin receptor in FG-2 carcinoma cells. In agreement with this notion, cell adhesion assays show that FG-2 cell attachment to fibronectin is only partially inhibited by anti-beta 1 integrin antibodies, implying that other fibronectin receptors may be involved. Taken together with recent reports on the vitronectin receptor function of alpha v beta 5, our results suggest that the previously described carcinoma cell integrin, alpha v beta x (Cheresh, D. A., Smith, J. W., Cooper, H. M., and Quaranta, V. (1989) Cell 57, 59-69), is a mixture of at least two different receptors: alpha v beta 5, mediating adhesion to vitronectin, and alpha v beta 6, mediating adhesion to fibronectin.</p>

                    <h2>Distinct ligand-binding modes for integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion to fibronectin versus vitronectin.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Cell surface integrins can adopt distinct conformations in response to ligand binding and intracellular signals. Several integrins including alpha(v)beta(3) can bind to multiple ligands. The binding of alpha(v)beta(3) to fibronectin and vitronectin was used as a model to determine whether the same or distinct forms of the receptor were utilized in strong binding to the two different ligands. A spinning-disc device was used to measure the relative strength of the alpha(v)beta(3)-ligand bonds. The initial binding reaction for both ligands occurred in the absence of metabolic energy and resulted in a strong adhesion to fibronectin but a weak adhesion to vitronectin. Increases in the strength of the alpha(v)beta(3)-vitronectin bond required phosphorylation of the beta(3) cytoplasmic domain, intracellular signals, and the binding of cytoskeletal proteins to cytoplasmic domains of beta(3) controlled by Tyr-747 and Tyr-759. In contrast, alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion to fibronectin was unaffected by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, mutations of Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 to phenylalanine, or availability of metabolic energy. This suggests that strong adhesion to fibronectin used the initial binding conformation, whereas strong binding to vitronectin required signaling-induced changes in the conformation of alpha(v)beta(3).</p>

                    <h2>Participation of syndecan 2 in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1: structural characteristics of heparan sulfate chains with avidity to COOH-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin.</h2>
                    <h3>Experimental cell research; 2000</h3>
                    <p>The present study provides direct evidence that syndecan 2 participates selectively in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1 through specific binding of its heparan sulfate side chains to the fibronectin substrate. Our previous study with Lewis lung carcinoma-derived P29 cells demonstrated that the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which binds to fibronectin, is syndecan 2 (N. Itano et al., 1996, Biochem. J. 315, 925-930). We here report that in vitro treatment of the cells by antisense oligonucleotide for syndecan 2 resulted in a failure to form stress fibers on fibronectin substrate in association with specific suppression of its cell surface expression. Instead, localization of actin filaments in the cytoplasmic cortex occurred. A similar response of the cells was observed when the cells were treated to eliminate functions of cell surface heparan sulfates, including exogenous addition of heparin and pretreatment with anti-heparan sulfate antibody, F58-10E4, and with proteinase-free heparitinase I. Size- and structure-defined oligosaccharides prepared from heparin and chemically modified heparins were utilized as competitive inhibitors to examine the structural characteristics of the cell surface heparan sulfates involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Their affinity chromatography on a column linked with a recombinant H-271 peptide containing a C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin demonstrated that 2-O-sulfated iduronates were essential for the binding. Inhibition studies revealed that a heparin-derived dodecasaccharide sample enriched with an IdoA(2OS)-GlcNS(6OS) disaccharide completely blocked binding of the syndecan 2 ectodomain to immobilized H-271 peptide. Finally, the dodecasaccharide sample was shown to inhibit stress fiber formation, triggered by adhesion of P29 cells to a CH-271 polypeptide consisting of both the RGD cell-binding and the C-terminal heparin-binding domains of fibronectin in a fused form. All these results consistently suggest that syndecan 2 proteoglycan interacts with the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin at the highly sulfated cluster(s), such as [IdoA(2OS)-GlcNS(6OS)](6) present in its heparan sulfate chains, to result in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1.</p>

                    <h2>TNF-alpha potentiates C5a-stimulated eosinophil adhesion to human bronchial epithelial cells: a role for alpha 5 beta 1 integrin.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950); 2002</h3>
                    <p>Cooperative action of inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules orchestrates eosinophil recruitment during allergic inflammation in the airways. This study investigated the mechanisms involved in increasing eosinophil adhesion to human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) following priming and activation of eosinophils with TNF-alpha and complement protein C5a, respectively. Under primed conditions, eosinophil adhesion increased 3-fold from basal (16%), and the effect was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the increase following stimulation with C5a alone (2-fold). Eosinophil contact with HBEC was essential for priming. In contrast to C5a, adhesion of eotaxin-stimulated eosinophils to HBEC was not primed with TNF-alpha nor IL-5, a known eosinophil-priming agent. Priming caused activation of alpha(M)beta(2) integrin; mAb against either the common beta(2) integrin subunit or its ICAM-1 ligand reduced the primed component of adhesion. Using mAbs against beta(1) or alpha(5), but not alpha(4) integrin subunit, together with anti-beta(2) integrin mAb, reduced stimulated adhesion to basal levels. Cross-linking alpha(5)beta(1) integrin increased alpha(M)beta(2) integrin-dependent adhesion of eosinophils. There are no known adhesion molecule ligands of alpha(5)beta(1) integrin expressed on HBEC; however, fibronectin, the major matrix protein ligand for alpha(5)beta(1) integrin, was detected in association with HBEC monolayers. A mAb against fibronectin, in combination with anti-beta(2) integrin mAb, reduced adhesion to basal levels. In conclusion, alpha(5)beta(1) integrin may provide a contact-dependent costimulus for eosinophil priming that, together with TNF-alpha, potentiated C5a activation of alpha(M)beta(2) integrin and increased eosinophil adhesion to ICAM-1. Fibronectin, associated with HBEC, may act as a ligand for alpha(5)beta(1) integrin. Dual regulation of eosinophil priming may prevent inappropriate activation of eosinophils in the circulation.</p>

                    <h2>Defining the topology of integrin alpha5beta1-fibronectin interactions using inhibitory anti-alpha5 and anti-beta1 monoclonal antibodies. Evidence that the synergy sequence of fibronectin is recognized by the amino-terminal repeats of the alpha5 subunit.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1997</h3>
                    <p>The high affinity interaction of integrin alpha5beta1 with the central cell binding domain (CCBD) of fibronectin requires both the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence (in the 10th type III repeat) and a second site (in the adjacent 9th type III repeat) which synergizes with RGD. We have attempted to map the fibronectin binding interface on alpha5beta1 using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit ligand recognition. The binding of two anti-alpha5 mAbs (P1D6 and JBS5) to alpha5beta1 was strongly inhibited by a tryptic CCBD fragment of fibronectin (containing both synergy sequence and RGD) but not by GRGDS peptide. Using recombinant wild type and mutated fragments of the CCBD, we show that the synergy region of the 9th type III repeat is involved in blocking the binding of P1D6 and JBS5 to alpha5beta1. In contrast, binding of the anti-beta1 mAb P4C10 to alpha5beta1 was inhibited to a similar extent by GRGDS peptide, the tryptic CCBD fragment, or recombinant proteins lacking the synergy region, indicating that the RGD sequence is involved in blocking P4C10 binding. P1D6 inhibited the interaction of a wild type CCBD fragment with alpha5beta1 but had no effect on the binding of a mutant fragment that lacked the synergy region. The epitopes of P1D6 and JBS5 mapped to the NH2-terminal repeats of the alpha5 subunit. Our results indicate that the synergy region is recognized primarily by the alpha5 subunit (in particular by its NH2-terminal repeats) but that the beta1 subunit plays the major role in binding of the RGD sequence. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms, specificity, and topology of integrin-ligand interactions.</p>

                    <h2>Purification and functional characterization of integrin alpha v beta 5. An adhesion receptor for vitronectin.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1990</h3>
                    <p>We have purified a novel member of the integrin gene family from placenta that serves as a vitronectin receptor. This integrin is composed of the alpha v subunit and a beta subunit that we designate beta 5. Purification was accomplished by immunodepleting a placental extract of integrin alpha v beta 3, allowing us to purify alpha v beta 5 from the remaining extract by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography on LM 142-Sepharose, which binds to the alpha v subunit. Purification to homogeneity was subsequently achieved by affinity chromatography on wheat germ lectin-Sepharose. Western blot analysis with antibodies raised against alpha v beta 5 and alpha v beta 3 demonstrated that beta 3 and beta 5 were distinct but confirmed that the alpha subunit of the two integrins were immunologically identical. Similarly, antibodies that bind beta 3 proximal to the ligand-binding site failed to react with beta 5, indicating an architectural difference at the ligand-binding site of these related integrins. This structural difference apparently results in a functional distinction, since purified alpha v beta 3 bound to vitronectin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin, whereas integrin alpha v beta 5 bound preferentially to vitronectin. Finally, we demonstrate by three criteria that beta 5 and beta x, the latter of which was identified in lung carcinoma cells (Cheresh, D. A., Smith, J. W., Cooper, H. M., and Quaranta, V. (1989) Cell 57, 59-69), are identical. First, peptide maps of beta x and beta 5 are identical. Secondly, polyclonal antibodies raised against alpha v beta 5 immunoprecipitate both beta 5 and beta x, and finally, the amino-terminal amino acid sequences of beta x and beta 5 are identical.</p>
