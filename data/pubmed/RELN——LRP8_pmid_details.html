                    <h2>Differential binding of ligands to the apolipoprotein E receptor 2.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2) is an important participant in the Reelin signaling pathway that directs cell positioning during embryogenesis. ApoER2 is a cell surface molecule that elicits intracellular signal transduction through binding of Reelin. The structural requirements for Reelin binding to apoER2 and the receptor domains involved in this process are unclear at present. Using a series of receptor mutants, we characterized the interaction of apoER2 with Reelin and compared this interaction to that of apoER2 with the receptor-associated protein (RAP), an apoER2 ligand that does not induce signaling. By surface plasmon resonance we demonstrate that apoER2 exhibits 6-fold higher affinity for Reelin than the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), which also functions as a Reelin receptor (K(D) 0.2 nM versus K(D) 1.2 nM). Acidic amino acid residues in complement-type repeat domains 1 and 3 of apoER2 are required for Reelin binding. The same regions of the receptor are also bound by RAP with a 25-fold lower affinity (K(D) 5 nM). Whereas RAP binds to apoER2 with a 1:1 stoichiometry, experimental evidence suggests that Reelin associates with two or more receptor molecules simultaneously to achieve high-affinity interaction. This finding indicates that aggregation of apoER2 by multivalent ligands such as Reelin may be the structural basis for signal transduction.</p>

                    <h2>Reelin is a ligand for lipoprotein receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Neuron; 1999</h3>
                    <p>A signaling pathway involving the extracellular protein Reelin and the intracellular adaptor protein Disabled-1 (Dab1) controls cell positioning during mammalian brain development. Here, we demonstrate that Reelin binds directly to lipoprotein receptors, preferably the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2). Binding requires calcium, and it is inhibited in the presence of apoE. Furthermore, the CR-50 monoclonal antibody, which inhibits Reelin function, blocks the association of Reelin with VLDLR. After binding to VLDLR on the cell surface, Reelin is internalized into vesicles. In dissociated neurons, apoE reduces the level of Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1. These data suggest that Reelin directs neuronal migration by binding to VLDLR and ApoER2.</p>

                    <h2>Binding of purified Reelin to ApoER2 and VLDLR mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of Disabled-1.</h2>
                    <h3>Brain research. Molecular brain research; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Reelin, Disabled-1 (Dab1), apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), and very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) participate in a signaling pathway required for layer formation during mammalian brain development. Binding of Reelin to ApoER2 and VLDLR induces a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1, an adaptor protein that associates with the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors. However, Reelin has also been proposed to signal through integrin and protocadherin. Here we compare the roles of ApoER2 and VLDLR in Reelin signaling. We used layer-specific markers to identify the final positions of early- and late-born neurons in the cortices of mice lacking ApoER2, VLDLR, or both ApoER2 and VLDLR. Subtle alterations were observed in mice lacking VLDLR, whereas more severe abnormalities were detected in the absence of ApoER2, and major disruptions were obvious in mice lacking both receptors. Purified Reelin associated more readily with ApoER2 than with VLDLR and no synergy was observed in the presence of both receptors. Consistent with the binding data, the level of Reelin-induced Dab1 phosphorylation was more severely reduced in neurons lacking ApoER2 than in neurons lacking VLDLR. However, similarly low levels of Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation were observed in ApoER2(-/-) and VLDLR(-/-) mice in vivo. Finally, there was a complete absence of Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 in cortical neurons from mice lacking both ApoER2 and VLDLR. These findings demonstrate that ApoER2 and VLDLR are essential for Reelin signaling and that no other receptor molecules can compensate for their role in mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1.</p>

                    <h2>Reelin and ApoE receptors cooperate to enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Two apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptors, the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor and apoE receptor 2 (apoER2), are also receptors for Reelin, a signaling protein that regulates neuronal migration during brain development. In the adult brain, Reelin is expressed by GABA-ergic interneurons, suggesting a potential function as a modulator of neurotransmission. ApoE receptors have been indirectly implicated in memory and neurodegenerative disorders because their ligand, apoE, is genetically associated with Alzheimer disease. We have used knockout mice to investigate the role of Reelin and its receptors in cognition and synaptic plasticity. Mice lacking either the VLDL receptor or the apoER2 show contextual fear conditioning deficits. VLDL receptor-deficient mice also have a moderate defect in long term potentiation (LTP), and apoER2 knockouts have a pronounced one. The perfusion of mouse hippocampal slices with Reelin has no effect on baseline synaptic transmission but significantly enhances LTP in area CA1. This Reelin-dependent augmentation of LTP is abolished in VLDL receptor and apoER2 knockout mice. Our results reveal a role for Reelin in controlling synaptic plasticity in the adult brain and suggest that both of its receptors are necessary for Reelin-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Thus, the impairment of apoE receptor-dependent neuromodulation may contribute to cognitive impairment and synaptic loss in Alzheimer disease.</p>
