                    <h2>Implications of nectin-like molecule-2/IGSF4/RA175/SgIGSF/TSLC1/SynCAM1 in cell-cell adhesion and transmembrane protein localization in epithelial cells.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Nectins are Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecules that play roles in organization of a variety of cell-cell junctions in cooperation with or independently of cadherins. Four nectins have been identified. Five nectin-like molecules, which have domain structures similar to those of nectins, have been identified, and we characterized here nectin-like molecule-2 (Necl-2)/IGSF4/RA175/SgIGSF/TSLC1/SynCAM1. Necl-2 showed Ca2+-independent homophilic cell-cell adhesion activity. It furthermore showed Ca2+-independent heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activity with Necl-1/TSLL1/SynCAM3 and nectin-3. Necl-2 was widely expressed in rat tissues examined. Necl-2 localized at the basolateral plasma membrane in epithelial cells of the mouse gall bladder, but not at specialized cell-cell junctions, such as tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes. Nectins bind afadin, whereas Necl-2 did not bind afadin but bound Pals2, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase family member known to bind Lin-7, implicated in the proper localization of the Let-23 protein in Caenorhabditis elegans, the homologue of mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor. These results indicate the unique localization of Necl-2 and its possible involvement in localization of a transmembrane protein(s) through Pals2.</p>

                    <h3>Journal of neuroimmunology; 2007</h3>
                    <p>Spermatogenic immunoglobulin superfamily (SgIGSF) expressed on nerve and mast cells, binds homophilically between both in culture. In the steady-state mesentery of mice, the proportion of morphologically degranulating mast cells was approximately 20%, and it increased nearly two-fold when the mesenteric nerve root was stimulated electrically. In contrast, there was no significant increase detectable in the mesentery of MITF-mutants, from which bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMMCs) lack SgIGSF. BMMCs from SgIGSF-knockout mice transplanted to the mesentery of mast cell-deficient W/W(v) mice did not degranulate in response to the mesenteric nerve stimulation, whereas transfection with SgIGSF cDNA restored those responses. SgIGSF appeared to promote communication between nerves and mast cells in the murine mesentery.</p>

                    <h2>Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) on mast cells promotes interaction with dorsal root ganglion neurites by heterophilic binding to nectin-3.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of neuroimmunology; 2012</h3>
                    <p>Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) on mast cells promotes attachment and communication with neurons by homophilic binding. However, we found that mast cell CADM1 was responsible for both the attachment of mast cells to dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurites and their calcium responses to activated DRG neurites, despite the low expression of CADM1 in DRG. Instead, nectin-3 was expressed on DRG neurons and localized to regions of cell-cell contact. A neutralizing antibody to nectin-3 inhibited both mast cell attachment and subsequent calcium responses. This suggests that heterophilic binding between CADM1 and nectin-3 mediates functional DRG-mast cell interactions in vitro.</p>

                    <h2>Trans-homophilic interaction of CADM1 activates PI3K by forming a complex with MAGuK-family proteins MPP3 and Dlg.</h2>
                    <h3>PloS one; 2014</h3>
                    <p>CADM1 (Cell adhesion molecule 1), a cell adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, is involved in cell-cell interaction and the formation and maintenance of epithelial structure. Expression of CADM1 is frequently downregulated in various tumors derived from epithelial cells. However, the intracellular signaling pathways activated by CADM1-mediated cell adhesion remain unknown. Here, we established a cell-based spreading assay to analyze the signaling pathway specifically activated by the trans-homophilic interaction of CADM1. In the assay, MDCK cells expressing exogenous CADM1 were incubated on the glass coated with a recombinant extracellular fragment of CADM1, and the degree of cell spreading was quantified by measuring their surface area. Assay screening of 104 chemical inhibitors with known functions revealed that LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), efficiently suppressed cell spreading in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibitors of Akt and Rac1, downstream effectors of PI3K, also partially suppressed cell spreading, while the addition of both inhibitors blocked cell spreading to the same extent as did LY294002. Furthermore, MPP3 and Dlg, membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs (MAGuK) proteins, connect CADM1 with p85 of PI3K by forming a multi-protein complex at the periphery of cells. These results suggest that trans-homophilic interaction mediated by CADM1 activates the PI3K pathway to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton and form epithelial cell structure.</p>
