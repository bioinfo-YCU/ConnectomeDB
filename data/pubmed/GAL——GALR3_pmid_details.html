                    <h2>Molecular characterization and expression of cloned human galanin receptors GALR2 and GALR3.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of neurochemistry; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Galanin is a 29- or 30-amino acid peptide with wide-ranging effects on hormone release, feeding behavior, smooth muscle contractility, and somatosensory neuronal function. Three distinct galanin receptor (GALR) subtypes, designated GALR1, 2, and 3, have been cloned from the rat. We report here the cloning of the human GALR2 and GALR3 genes, an initial characterization of their pharmacology with respect to radioligand binding and signal transduction pathways, and a profile of their expression in brain and peripheral tissues. Human GALR2 and GALR3 show, respectively, 92 and 89% amino acid sequence identity with their rat homologues. Radioligand binding studies with 125I-galanin show that recombinant human GALR2 binds with high affinity to human galanin (K(D) = 0.3 nM). Human GALR3 binds galanin with less affinity (IC50 of 12 nM for porcine galanin and 75 nM for human galanin). Human GALR2 was shown to couple to phospholipase C and elevation of intracellular calcium levels as assessed by aequorin luminescence in HEK-293 cells and by Xenopus melanophore pigment aggregation and dispersion assays, in contrast to human GALR1 and human GALR3, which signal predominantly through inhibition of adenylate cyclase. GALR2 mRNA shows a wide distribution in the brain (mammillary nuclei, dentate gyrus, cingulate gyrus, and posterior hypothalamic, supraoptic, and arcuate nuclei), and restricted peripheral tissue distribution with highest mRNA levels detected in human small intestine. In comparison, whereas GALR3 mRNA was expressed in many areas of the rat brain, there was abundant expression in the primary olfactory cortex, olfactory tubercle, the islands of Calleja, the hippocampal CA regions of Ammon's horn, and the dentate gyrus. GALR3 mRNA was highly expressed in human testis and was detectable in adrenal gland and pancreas. The genes for human GALR2 and 3 were localized to chromosomes 17q25 and 22q12.2-13.1, respectively.</p>

                    <h2>Cloned human and rat galanin GALR3 receptors. Pharmacology and activation of G-protein inwardly rectifying K+ channels.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1998</h3>
                    <p>The neuropeptide galanin has been implicated in the regulation of processes such as nociception, cognition, feeding behavior, and hormone secretion. Multiple galanin receptors are predicted to mediate its effects, but only two functionally coupled receptors have been reported. We now report the cloning of a third galanin receptor distinct from GALR1 and GALR2. The receptor, termed GALR3, was isolated from a rat hypothalamus cDNA library by both expression and homology cloning approaches. The rat GALR3 receptor cDNA can encode a protein of 370 amino acids with 35% and 52% identity to GALR1 and GALR2, respectively. Localization of mRNA by solution hybridization/RNase protection demonstrates that the GALR3 transcript is widely distributed, but expressed at low abundance, with the highest levels in the hypothalamus and pituitary. We also isolated the gene encoding the human homologue of GALR3. The human GALR3 receptor is 90% identical to rat GALR3 and contains 368 amino acids. Binding of porcine 125I-galanin to stably expressed rat and human GALR3 receptors is saturable (rat KD = 0.98 nM and human KD = 2.23 nM) and displaceable by galanin peptides and analogues in the following rank order: rat galanin, porcine galanin approximately M32, M35 approximately porcine galanin-(-7 to +29), galantide, human galanin > M40, galanin-(1-16) > [D-Trp2]galanin-(1-29), galanin-(3-29). This profile resembles that of the rat GALR1 and GALR2 receptors with the notable exception that human galanin, galanin-(1-16), and M40 show lower affinity at GALR3. In Xenopus oocytes, activation of rat and human GALR3 receptors co-expressed with potassium channel subunits GIRK1 and GIRK4 resulted in inward K+ currents characteristic of Gi/Go-coupled receptors. These data confirm the functional efficacy of GALR3 receptors and further suggest that GALR3 signaling pathways resemble those of GALR1 in that both can activate potassium channels linked to the regulation of neurotransmitter release.</p>

                    <h2>Cloning and characterization of the human galanin GALR2 receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Peptides; 1998</h3>
                    <p>We present the molecular cloning and characterization of the human galanin receptor, hGALR2. hGALR2 shares 85%, 39%, and 57% amino acid identities to rGALR2, hGALR1, and hGALR3, respectively. hGALR2, along with rGALR2, can be distinguished from the other cloned galanin receptors by a tolerance for both N-terminal extension and C-terminal deletion of galanin, as well as by a primary signaling mechanism involving phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis and calcium mobilization. By RT-PCR, GALR2 mRNA was abundant in human hippocampus, hypothalamus, heart, kidney, liver, and small intestine. A weak GALR2 mRNA signal was detected in human retina, and no signal was detected in cerebral cortex, lung, spleen, stomach, or pituitary.</p>
