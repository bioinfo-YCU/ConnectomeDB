                    <h2>A highly selective CCR2 chemokine agonist encoded by human herpesvirus 6.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>The chemokine-like, secreted protein product of the U83 gene from human herpesvirus 6, here named vCCL4, was chemically synthesized to be characterized in a complete library of the 18 known human chemokine receptors expressed individually in stably transfected cell lines. vCCL4 was found to cause calcium mobilization as efficiently as the endogenous chemokine ligand CCL2 through the CCR2 receptor, whereas the virally encoded chemokine did not affect any of the other 17 human chemokine receptors tested. Mutual cross-desensitization between CCL2 and vCCL4 was demonstrated in the CCR2-transfected cells. The affinity of vCCL4 for the CCR2 receptor was 79 nm as determined in competition binding against radioactively labeled CCL2. In the murine pre-B lymphocyte cell line L1.2 stably transfected with the CCR2 receptor, vCCL4 acted as a relatively low potency but highly efficacious chemoattractant being equally or more efficacious in causing cell migration than CCL2 and CCL7 and considerably more efficacious than CCL8 and CCL13. It is concluded that human herpesvirus 6 encodes a highly selective and efficacious CCR2 agonist, which will attract CCR2 expressing cells, for example macrophages and monocytes, conceivably for the virus to infect and to establish latency in. It is suggested that vCCL4 during reactivation of the virus in for example monocyte-derived microglia could perhaps be involved in the pathogenesis of the CCR2-dependent disease, multiple sclerosis.</p>

                    <h2>Monocyte chemotactic protein-2 (MCP-2) uses CCR1 and CCR2B as its functional receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-2 is a member of the C-C chemokine subfamily, which shares more than 60% sequence homology with MCP-1 and MCP-3 and about 30% homology with macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, regulated on activation of normal T cell expressed (RANTES), and MIP-1beta. Despite this considerable sequence homology to other C-C chemokines, MCP-2 appears to have unique functional properties in comparison with other C-C chemokines such as MCP-1 and MCP-3. Although evidence obtained from studies on leukocytes suggested that MCP-2 may share the receptors with these C-C chemokines, the actual functional receptors for MCP-2 have not yet been identified. In this study, by using radioiodinated MCP-2, we identified high affinity binding sites for MCP-2 on human peripheral blood monocytes. The MCP-2 binding was competed for by MCP-1 and MCP-3, but less well by MIP-1alpha or RANTES. In experiments using cells transfected with C-C chemokine receptors, 125I-MCP-2 bound to human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with CCR1 or CCR2B, known to also bind MIP-1alpha/RANTES and MCP-1, respectively, but both shared by MCP-3. The binding of 125I-MCP-2 to these receptor-transfected cells was displaced completely by chemokines that bind to these receptors. Both CCR1- and CCR2B-transfected 293 cells showed significant migration in response to MCP-2, in addition to responding to other specific chemokines. These results clearly demonstrate that MCP-2, unlike MCP-1, uses both CCR1 as well as CCR2B as its functional receptors, and this accounts for the unique activities of MCP-2.</p>

                    <h2>Matrix metalloproteinase processing of monocyte chemoattractant proteins generates CC chemokine receptor antagonists with anti-inflammatory properties in vivo.</h2>
                    <h3>Blood; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-3 is inactivated upon cleavage by the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gelatinase A (MMP-2). We investigated the susceptibility to proteolytic processing of the 4 human MCPs by 8 recombinant MMPs to determine whether MCP-3 is an isolated example or represents a general susceptibility of chemokines to proteolytic inactivation by these important inflammatory proteases. In addition to MMP-2, MCP-3 is efficiently cleaved by membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP, the cellular activator of MMP-2, and by collagenase-1 and collagenase-3 (MMP-1, MMP-13) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3). Specificity was shown by absence of cleavage by matrilysin (MMP-7) and the leukocytic MMPs neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) and gelatinase B (MMP-9). The closely related chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-4 were not cleaved by MMP-2 or MT1-MMP, but were cleaved by MMP-1 and MMP-3 with varying efficiency. MCPs were typically cleaved between residues 4 and 5, but MCP-4 was further processed at Val7-Pro8. Synthetic MCP analogs corresponding to the MMP-cleaved forms bound CC chemokine receptor (CCR)-2 and CCR-3, but lacked chemoattractant activity in pre-B cells transfected with CCR-2 and CCR-3 or in THP-1 monocytic cells, a transformed leukemic cell line. Moreover, the truncated products of MCP-2 and MCP-4, like MCP-3, were potent antagonists of their cognate CC chemokine receptors in transwell cell migration assays in vitro. When they were injected 24 hours after the initiation of carrageenan-induced inflammation in rat paws, their in vivo antagonist activities were revealed by a greater than 66% reduction in inflammatory edema progression after 12 hours. We propose that MMPs have an important role in modulating inflammatory and immune responses by processing chemokines in wound healing and in disease.</p>
