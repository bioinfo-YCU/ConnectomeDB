                    <h2>Molecular cloning and radioligand binding characterization of the chemokine receptor CCR5 from rhesus macaque and human.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical pharmacology; 2005</h3>
                    <p>The aim of this study was to determine if macaque represents a suitable species for the pre-clinical evaluation of novel CCR5 antagonists, such as maraviroc (UK-427,857). To do this we cloned and expressed CCR5 from rhesus macaque and compared the binding properties of [125I]-MIP-1beta and [3H]-maraviroc with human recombinant CCR5. [125I]-MIP-1beta bound with similar high affinity to CCR5 from macaque (K(d) = 0.24 +/- 0.05 nM) and human (K(d) = 0.23 +/- 0.05 nM) and with similar kinetic properties. In competition binding studies the affinity of a range of human chemokines for macaque CCR5 was also similar to human CCR5. Maraviroc inhibited binding of [125I]-MIP-1beta to CCR5 from macaque and human with similar potency (IC50 = 17.50 +/- 1.24 nM and 7.18 +/- 0.93 nM, respectively) and antagonised MIP-1beta induced intracellular calcium release mediated through CCR5 from macaque and human with similar potency (IC50 = 17.50 +/- 3.30 nM and 12.07 +/- 1.89, respectively). [3H]-maraviroc bound with high affinity to CCR5 from macaque (K(d) = 1.36+/-0.07 nM) and human (K(d) = 0.86 +/- 0.08 nM), but was found to dissociate approximately 10-fold more quickly from macaque CCR5. However, as with the human receptor, maraviroc was shown to be a high affinity, potent functional antagonist of macaque CCR5 thereby indicating that the macaque should be a suitable species in which to evaluate the pharmacology, safety and potential mechanism-related toxicology of novel CCR5 antagonists.</p>

                    <h2>CCR5 has an expanded ligand-binding repertoire and is the primary receptor used by MCP-2 on activated T cells.</h2>
                    <h3>Cellular immunology; 1998</h3>
                    <p>CCR5 is a chemokine receptor expressed by T cells and macrophages, which also functions as the principal coreceptor for macrophage (M)-tropic HIV-1 strains to enter the host cells. In this study, we aim to better understand the ligand-binding profiles of CCR5 and the chemokine-receptor usage on leukocyte cells. We found that MCP-2 could bind to CCR5 transfectants with high affinity and cross-compete effectively with RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta. MCP-2 is a true agonist for CCR5, eliciting a robust chemotactic response in CCR5 transfectants similar to that of the three known CCR5 ligands and exhibiting cross-desensitization with RANTES in the Ca2+ flux response. MCP-4 also bound to CCR5 with high affinity and was efficiently displaced by other CCR5 ligands. However, MCP-4 only partially displaced the binding of radiolabeled MIP-1alpha and caused a chemotactic response only at high concentrations. Furthermore, MCP-2 inhibited the binding of the M-tropic HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein to CCR5 and HIV-1 infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. More importantly, we found that MCP-2 could bind and elicit chemotaxis in CD3-activated and IL-2-maintained T cells, and most of these functions could be specifically inhibited by the anti-CCR5 mAb 2D7, whereas the responses mediated by MIP-1alpha or MCP-4 were only partially inhibited by 2D7. Thus, although MCP-2 can bind to and signal through CCR1, CCR2b, and CCR5, among which both CCR2 and CCR5 are expressed at high levels on activated T cells, it appears to preferably utilize CCR5 on these cells. In contrast, MIP-1alpha and MCP-4 seem to activate multiple receptors on the same cells.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of the role of the N-loop of MIP-1 beta in CCR5 binding.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemistry; 2002</h3>
                    <p>MIP-1beta is a CC-chemokine that plays a role in inflammation and host defense mechanisms by interacting with its specific receptor CCR5. CCR5 is a major coreceptor for macrophage-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and as a consequence, MIP-1beta can inhibit HIV entry. It is therefore of interest to understand how MIP-1beta and other CCR5 ligands bind to their receptor, as such understanding could lead to the rational design of more efficient HIV entry blockers. We have previously demonstrated the importance of Phe13, and of basic residues of the 40's loop, in mediating high-affinity binding of MIP-1beta to CCR5. We have now investigated further the relative contribution of other MIP-1beta residues in the interaction of the chemokine with CCR5, by studying the functional consequences of point mutations within the N-loop and the 3(10) turn of MIP-1beta, affecting the charge, size, and H-bonding properties of the side chains. Our data suggest that, in addition to Phe13, three amino acids of the N-loop and 3(10) turn (Arg18, Lys19, and Arg22) interact with CCR5 through their positive charge. We also found that Pro21 contributes to the CCR5 binding properties of MIP-1beta. Moreover, NMR spectroscopy has revealed that the presence of Tyr at position 15 is necessary for the proper folding of the chemokine. Our results therefore demonstrate that the binding determinants of MIP-1beta consist of residues arranged on one surface of the protein, including most of the basic residues in MIP-1beta, as well as two key hydrophobic groups. The good correlation observed between the potency of the mutants in a functional assay and their binding affinity strongly argues that basic residues Arg18, Lys19, and Arg22 of MIP-1beta are essential for its CCR5 binding properties, without a primary effect on CCR5 activation.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a novel human CC chemokine receptor (CCR5) for RANTES, MIP-1beta, and MIP-1alpha.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Chemokines affect leukocyte chemotactic and activation activities through specific G protein-coupled receptors. In an effort to map the closely linked CC chemokine receptor genes, we identified a novel chemokine receptor encoded 18 kilobase pairs downstream of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) receptor (CCR2) gene on human chromosome 3p21. The deduced amino acid sequence of this novel receptor, designated CCR5, is most similar to CCR2B, sharing 71% identical residues. Transfected cells expressing the receptor bind RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed), MIP-1beta, and MIP-1alpha with high affinity and generate inositol phosphates in response to these chemokines. This same combination of chemokines has recently been shown to potently inhibit human immunodeficiency virus replication in human peripheral blood leukocytes (Cocchi, F., DeVico, A. L., Garzino-Demo, A., Arya, S. K., Gallo, R. C., and Lusso, P.(1995) Science 270, 1811-1815). CCR5 is expressed in lymphoid organs such as thymus and spleen, as well as in peripheral blood leukocytes, including macrophages and T cells, and is the first example of a human chemokine receptor that signals in response to MIP-1beta.</p>
