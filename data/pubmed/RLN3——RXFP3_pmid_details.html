                    <h2>Identification of relaxin-3/INSL7 as an endogenous ligand for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPCR135.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>GPCR135, publicly known as somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor, is expressed in the central nervous system and its cognate ligand(s) has not been identified. We have found that both rat and porcine brain extracts stimulated 35S-labeled guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) incorporation in cells over-expressing GPCR135. Multiple rounds of extraction, purification, followed by N-terminal sequence analysis of the ligand from porcine brain revealed that the ligand is a product of the recently identified gene, relaxin-3 (aka insulin-7 or INSL7). Recombinant human relaxin-3 potently stimulates GTPgammaS binding and inhibits cAMP accumulation in GPCR135 overexpressing cells with EC50 values of 0.25 and 0.35 nM, respectively. 125I-Relaxin-3 binds GPCR135 at high affinity with a Kd value of 0.31 nM. Relaxin-3 is the only member of the insulin/relaxin superfamily that can activate GPCR135. In situ hybridization showed that relaxin-3 mRNA is predominantly expressed in the dorsomedial ventral tegmental nucleus of the brainstem (aka nucleus incertus), as well as in discrete cells in the lateral periaqueductal gray and in the central gray nucleus. GPCR135 is expressed abundantly in the hypothalamus with discrete expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and supraoptic nucleus, as well as in the cortex, septal nucleus, and preoptical area. Relaxin-3 has previously been shown to bind and activate the LGR7 relaxin receptor. However, we believe that neuroanatomical colocalization of GPCR135 and relaxin-3, coupled with a clear high affinity interaction, suggest that GPCR135 is the receptor for relaxin-3. The identification of relaxin-3 as the ligand for GPCR135 provides the framework for the discovery of a new brainstem/hypothalamus circuitry.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological characterization of relaxin-3/INSL7 receptors GPCR135 and GPCR142 from different mammalian species.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 2005</h3>
                    <p>Relaxin-3 has recently been identified as a ligand for two structurally related G-protein-coupled receptors, human GPCR135 and GPCR142. This current study reports the characterization of mouse and rat GPCR135 as well as GPCR142 from mouse, monkey, cow, and pig at the molecular and pharmacological levels. Mouse and rat GPCR135 exhibit high homology (>85%) to the human GPCR135 and have very similar pharmacological properties to that of the human GPCR135. Human and mouse/rat relaxin-3 both bind to and activate mouse, rat, and human GPCR135 at high affinity with IC(50) or EC(50) values close to 0.5 nM. In contrast, the mouse GPCR142 is less well conserved (74% homology) with human GPCR142. The rat GPCR142 gene was found to be a pseudogene. We further cloned GPCR142 genes from monkey, cow, and pig and found that they are highly homologous (>84%) to human GPCR142. Pharmacological characterization of GPCR142 from different species demonstrated that relaxin-3 binds to GPCR142 from different species at high affinity (IC(50) < 5 nM). However, relaxin-3 does not stimulate a Ca(2+) response in cells coexpressing Galpha(16) and mouse GPCR142, whereas it does for cells expressing GPCR142 from other species tested. Our results suggest that GPCR142 may have a diminished role as a receptor for relaxin-3 in rodents, or perhaps GPCR142 functions as a receptor for another ligand in nonrodents. Boels and Schaller recently reported bradykinin as a ligand for GPCR142 (also known as GPR100). In this report, we demonstrate that bradykinin activates neither GPCR135 nor GPCR142, whereas relaxin-3 does.</p>
