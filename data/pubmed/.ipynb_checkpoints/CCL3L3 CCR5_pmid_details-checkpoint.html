                    <h2>Identification of amino acid residues critical for LD78beta, a variant of human macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, binding to CCR5 and inhibition of R5 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication.</h2>
                    <p>In an attempt to determine which amino acid(s) of LD78beta, a variant of human macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, plays a critical role in the interaction with CCR5, we generated six LD78beta variants with an amino acid substituted to Ala at the NH(2) terminus of LD78beta. There was no significant difference in eliciting Ca(2+) flux and chemotaxis among the variants with the exception of LD78beta(T9A) showing a substantially reduced activity. The comparative order for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication inhibition was: LD78beta(P8A) > LD78beta(D6A) > LD78beta(WT), LD78beta(L3A) > LD78beta(T7A), LD78beta(P2A) > LD78beta(T9A). In binding inhibition assays of LD78beta variants using 2D7 monoclonal antibody and (125)I-labeled macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, the comparative order was: LD78beta(P8A), LD78beta(D6A) > LD78beta(WT) > LD78beta(L3A) > LD78beta(T7A) > LD78beta(T9A), LD78betaP2A). The order for CCR5 down-regulation induction was comparable to that for binding inhibition. The present data suggest that Pro-2, Asp-6, Pro-8, and Thr-9 are critical for LD78beta binding to CCR5 and HIV-1 replication inhibition, and that LD78beta binding to CCR5, regardless of affinity, is sufficient for the initial signal transduction of LD78beta, whereas the greater anti-HIV-1 activity requires the greater magnitude of binding. The data also suggest that LD78beta variants with appropriate amino acid substitution(s) such as LD78beta(D6A) and LD78beta(P8A) may represent effective chemokine-based anti-HIV-1 therapeutics while preserving LD78beta-CCR5 interactions.</p>

                    <h2>LD78beta, a non-allelic variant of human MIP-1alpha (LD78alpha), has enhanced receptor interactions and potent HIV suppressive activity.</h2>
                    <p>Chemokines play diverse roles in inflammatory and non-inflammatory situations via activation of heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptors. Also, many chemokine receptors can act as cofactors for cellular entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro. CCR5, a receptor for chemokines MIP-1alpha (LD78alpha), MIP-1beta, RANTES, and MCP2, is of particular importance in vivo as polymorphisms in this gene affect HIV infection and rate of progression to AIDS. Moreover, the CCR5 ligands can prevent HIV entry through this receptor and likely contribute to the control of HIV infection. Here we show that a non-allelic isoform of human MIP-1alpha (LD78alpha), termed LD78beta or MIP-1alphaP, has enhanced receptor binding affinities to CCR5 (approximately 6-fold) and the promiscuous beta-chemokine receptor, D6 (approximately 15-20-fold). We demonstrate that a proline residue at position 2 of MIP-1alphaP is responsible for this enhanced activity. Moreover, MIP-1alphaP is by far the most potent natural CCR5 agonist described to date, and importantly, displays markedly higher HIV1 suppressive activity than all other human MIP-1alpha isoforms examined. In addition, while RANTES has been described as the most potent inhibitor of CCR5-mediated HIV entry, MIP-1alphaP was as potent as, if not more potent than, RANTES in HIV-1 suppressive assays. This property suggests that MIP-1alphaP may be of importance in controlling viral spread in HIV-infected individuals.</p>
