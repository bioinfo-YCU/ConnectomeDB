                    <h2>Interaction of metargidin (ADAM-15) with alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1 integrins on different haemopoietic cells.</h2>
                    <p>Metargidin (ADAM-15) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease Domain) family of proteins and is widely expressed in different tissues and cell types. Members of this family contain an amino-terminal metalloprotease domain followed by a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region and a membrane proximal EGF-like domain. The disintegrin domain of metargidin contains an RGD tripeptide sequence, suggesting that it may potentially interact with the integrin family of proteins. Here we identify integrin ligands for metargidin on haemopoietic cells, by using a chimeric protein containing the extracellular domain of metargidin fused to the Fc portion of human IgG. Binding activity to a panel of human cell lines was analysed by solid-phase cell-adhesion assays. Metargidin bound to a monocytic cell line, U937, and a T cell line, MOLT-4, in a specific manner. Adhesion was divalent cation- and temperature- dependent and strongly enhanced by Mn2+, all features of integrin-mediated binding. Using a panel of anti-integrin antibodies we show that alphavbeta3 is a ligand for metargidin on U937 cells. In contrast, for MOLT-4 cells, the integrin alpha5beta1 contributes to cell binding. Adhesion was mediated by the disintegrin domain of metargidin as RGD-based peptides inhibited cell binding to both cell lines. The specificity of the interaction between both alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1 and metargidin was further confirmed by solid-phase adhesion assays using purified recombinant integrins. These results together indicate that metargidin can function as a cell adhesion molecule via interactions with alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1 integrins.</p>

                    <h2>RGD-independent binding of integrin alpha9beta1 to the ADAM-12 and -15 disintegrin domains mediates cell-cell interaction.</h2>
                    <p>ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteases) mediate several important processes (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha release, fertilization, and myoblast fusion). The ADAM disintegrin domains generally lack RGD motifs, and their receptors are virtually unknown. Here we show that integrin alpha(9)beta(1) specifically interacts with the recombinant ADAMs-12 and -15 disintegrin domains in an RGD-independent manner. We also show that interaction between ADAM-12 or -15 and alpha(9)beta(1) supports cell-cell interaction. Interestingly, the cation requirement and integrin activation status required for alpha(9)beta(1)/ADAM-mediated cell adhesion and cell-cell interaction is similar to those required for known integrin-extracellular matrix interaction. These results are quite different from recent reports that ADAM-2/alpha(6)beta(1) interaction during sperm/egg fusion requires an integrin activation status distinct from that for extracellular matrix interaction. These results suggest that alpha(9)beta(1) may be a major receptor for ADAMs that lack RGD motifs, and that, considering a wide distribution of ADAMs and alpha(9)beta(1), this interaction may be of potential biological and pathological significance.</p>
