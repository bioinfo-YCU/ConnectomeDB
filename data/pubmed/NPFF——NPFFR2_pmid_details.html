                    <h2>Identification and characterization of two G protein-coupled receptors for neuropeptide FF.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2000</h3>
                    <p>The central nervous system octapeptide, neuropeptide FF (NPFF), is believed to play a role in pain modulation and opiate tolerance. Two G protein-coupled receptors, NPFF1 and NPFF2, were isolated from human and rat central nervous system tissues. NPFF specifically bound to NPFF1 (K(d) = 1.13 nm) and NPFF2 (K(d) = 0.37 nm), and both receptors were activated by NPFF in a variety of heterologous expression systems. The localization of mRNA and binding sites of these receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the lateral hypothalamus, the spinal trigeminal nuclei, and the thalamic nuclei supports a role for NPFF in pain modulation. Among the receptors with the highest amino acid sequence homology to NPFF1 and NPFF2 are members of the orexin, NPY, and cholecystokinin families, which have been implicated in feeding. These similarities together with the finding that BIBP3226, an anorexigenic Y1 receptor ligand, also binds to NPFF1 suggest a potential role for NPFF1 in feeding. The identification of NPFF1 and NPFF2 will help delineate their roles in these and other physiological functions.</p>

                    <h2>Quantitative autoradiographic distribution of NPFF1 neuropeptide FF receptor in the rat brain and comparison with NPFF2 receptor by using [125I]YVP and [(125I]EYF as selective radioligands.</h2>
                    <h3>Neuroscience; 2002</h3>
                    <p>The selectivity of two new radioligands, [(125)I]YVP ([(125)I]YVPNLPQRF-NH(2)) and [(125)I]EYF ([(125)I]EYWSLAAPQRF-NH(2)), for neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor subtypes was determined using HEK293 cells expressing hNPFF(1) and CHO cells expressing hNPFF(2) receptors. Saturation binding and displacement experiments showed that [(125)I]YVP and [(125)I]EYF bound selectively with a very high affinity, K(D)=0.18 nM and 0.06 nM, to NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptors respectively. By using in vitro autoradiography with these radioligands and frog pancreatic polypeptide (PP) as selective unlabelled competitor of NPFF(2) binding sites, NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptor distribution was analyzed throughout the rat CNS. The highest densities of [(125)I]EYF binding sites were seen in the most external layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the parafascicular thalamic nucleus, laterodorsal thalamic nucleus and presubiculum of hippocampus. All specific binding of this radioligand was inhibited by 200 nM frog PP. The density of 0.1 nM [(125)I]YVP binding was much smaller in all brain areas and frog PP-insensitive binding sites (NPFF(1) receptor subtype) were detected in septal, thalamic and hypothalamic areas but were absent in the spinal cord. The restricted distribution of NPFF(1) receptors in the CNS supports its specific role in a limited number of neuronal functions. In contrast to the rat spinal cord where the NPFF(1) system is absent, there is no strict separation between NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) system at the supraspinal level.</p>

                    <h2>Agonist and antagonist activities on human NPFF(2) receptors of the NPY ligands GR231118 and BIBP3226.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) is a part of a neurotransmitter system acting as a modulator of endogenous opioid functions. At this time, no non-peptide or peptide NPFF-antagonists have been discovered. Here, we demonstrate that Neuropeptide Y (NPY) ligands, in fact possess significant ability to interact with the human NPFF(2) receptors. NPY Y(1) antagonist BIBP3226 and mixed Y(1) antagonist/Y(4) agonist GR231118 are able to displace with low affinity, 50 -- 100 nM, the specific binding on NPFF receptors expressed in CHO cells as well as in rat dorsal spinal cord, an affinity however superior to those determined against Y(2), Y(4) or Y(5) receptors. Furthermore, BIBP3226 which is unable to inhibit the forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production mediated by NPFF(2) receptors, antagonizes the effect of NPFF, revealing the first antagonist of NPFF receptors. These properties of NPY ligands on Neuropeptide FF receptors must be considered when evaluating pharmacological activities of these drugs.</p>

                    <h2>Receptor for the pain modulatory neuropeptides FF and AF is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Opiate tolerance and dependence are major clinical and social problems. The anti-opiate neuropeptides FF and AF (NPFF and NPAF) have been implicated in pain modulation as well as in opioid tolerance and may play a critical role in this process, although their mechanism of action has remained unknown. Here we describe a cDNA encoding a novel neuropeptide Y-like human orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), referred to as HLWAR77 for which NPAF and NPFF have high affinity. Cells transiently or stably expressing HLWAR77 bind and respond in a concentration-dependent manner to NPAF and NPFF and are also weakly activated by FMRF-amide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide) and a variety of related peptides. The high affinity and potency of human NPFF and human NPAF for HLWAR77 strongly suggest that these are the cognate ligands for this receptor. Expression of HLWAR77 was demonstrated in brain regions associated with opiate activity, consistent with the pain-modulating activity of these peptides, whereas the expression in adipose tissue suggests other physiological and pathophysiological activities for FMRF-amide neuropeptides. The discovery that the anti-opiate neuropeptides are the endogenous ligands for HLWAR77 will aid in defining the physiological role(s) of these ligands and facilitate the identification of receptor agonists and antagonists.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of the NPGP receptor and identification of a novel short mRNA isoform in human hypothalamus.</h2>
                    <h3>Regulatory peptides; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Recently, an orphan G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) termed NPGPR was described. A shorter variant of this receptor lacking exon 1 was shown to have subnanomolar affinity for neuropeptide FF (NPFF), a pain modulatory peptide, and therefore was named NPFF(2) receptor. Here, we characterize the full-length cloned NPGPR and identify a novel short form lacking exon 2 with a differential pattern of mRNA abundance in several tissues and organs. The NPGPR is most similar to the recently cloned neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor which lacks exon 1, but also shows high homology to the orexin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor families, two neuropeptides involved in food intake regulation. Therefore, we used binding studies to examine the interaction of NPFF, orexin and NPY with the NPGPR. [125I] NPFF was displaced by NPFF with an IC(50) of 14.7 +/- 8.8 nM, whereas [125I] Orexin B was displaced by Orexin B with an IC(50) of 415 +/- 195 nM. We conclude that orexins interact with the NPGPR and that the affinity of NPFF for NPGPR is approximately 100-fold lower than for the NPFF2 receptor. We postulate that NPGPR is a splice variant of the family of NPFF receptors and displays a binding profile different from the other members of the NPFF receptor family due to the presence of exon 1. In order to evaluate whether NPGPR levels are affected by the feeding status, we examined the mRNA level using real-time PCR in two feeding models, i.e. before and after diet-induced body weight increase as well as after chronic food restriction in rats. However, hypothalamic NPGPR mRNA was unchanged in both models. Therefore, our evidence does not support the hypothesis that NPGPR is involved in feeding regulation.</p>
