                    <h2>Axl receptor tyrosine kinase stimulated by the vitamin K-dependent protein encoded by growth-arrest-specific gene 6.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The Axl receptor tyrosine kinase was identified as a protein encoded by a transforming gene from primary human myeloid leukaemia cells by DNA-mediated transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Axl is the founding member of a family of related receptors that includes Eyk, encoded by a chicken proto-oncogene originally described as a retroviral transforming gene, and c-Mer, encoded by a human proto-oncogene expressed in neoplastic B- and T-cell lines. The transforming activity of Axl demonstrates that the receptor can drive cellular proliferation. The function of Axl in non-transformed cells and tissues is unknown, but may involve the stimulation of cell proliferation in response to an appropriate signal, namely a ligand that activates the receptor. We report here the purification of an Axl stimulatory factor, and its identification as the product of growth-arrest-specific gene 6 (ref. 6). This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a ligand for the Axl family of receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Identification of the product of growth arrest-specific gene 6 as a common ligand for Axl, Sky, and Mer receptor tyrosine kinases.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Axl, Sky, and Mer, members of an Axl/Sky receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily, are typified by the cell adhesion molecule-related extracellular domain. The product of growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6), structurally homologous to the anticoagulant protein S, was recently identified as the ligand for Axl and Sky, but the ligand for Mer remained unknown. We have now obtained evidence that Gas6 can also function as a ligand for Mer. Co-precipitation analysis, using soluble receptors of Axl, Sky, and Mer (Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc) composed of the extracellular domain of receptors fused to the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G1, clearly showed that Gas6, but not protein S, specifically bound to Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc fusion proteins. Quantitative kinetic analyses using a BIAcore biosensor instrument revealed dissociation constants (Kd) of the binding of rat Gas6 to Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc are 0.4, 2.7, and 29 nM, respectively. We also found that Gas6 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Axl, Sky, and Mer receptors ectopically expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that Gas6 is a common ligand for Axl, Sky, and Mer, all known members of an Axl/Sky receptor subfamily.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of Gas6, a member of the superfamily of G domain-containing proteins, as a ligand for Rse and Axl.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Rse, Ax1, and c-Mer comprise a family of cell adhesion molecule-related tyrosine kinase receptors. Human Gas6 was recently shown to act as a ligand for both human Rse (Godowski et al., 1995) and human Ax1 (Varnum et al., 1995). Gas6 contains an NH2-terminal Gla domain followed by four epidermal growth factor-like repeats and tandem globular (G) domains. The G domains are related to those found in sex hormone-binding globulin and to those utilized by laminin and agrin for binding to the dystroglycan complex. A series of Gas6 variants were tested for their ability to bind to Rse and Ax1. The Gla domain and epidermal growth factor-like repeats were not required for receptor binding, as deletion variants of Gas6 which lacked these domains bound to the extracellular domains of both Rse and Axl. A deletion variant of Gas6 containing just the G domain region was shown to activate Rse phosphorylation. These results provide evidence that G domains can act as signaling molecules by activating transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, they provide a structural link between the activation of cell adhesion related receptors and the control of cell growth and differentiation by the G domain-containing superfamily of proteins.</p>

                    <h2>Structural basis for Gas6-Axl signalling.</h2>
                    <h3>The EMBO journal; 2006</h3>
                    <p>Receptor tyrosine kinases of the Axl family are activated by the vitamin K-dependent protein Gas6. Axl signalling plays important roles in cancer, spermatogenesis, immunity, and platelet function. The crystal structure at 3.3 A resolution of a minimal human Gas6/Axl complex reveals an assembly of 2:2 stoichiometry, in which the two immunoglobulin-like domains of the Axl ectodomain are crosslinked by the first laminin G-like domain of Gas6, with no direct Axl/Axl or Gas6/Gas6 contacts. There are two distinct Gas6/Axl contacts of very different size, both featuring interactions between edge beta-strands. Structure-based mutagenesis, protein binding assays and receptor activation experiments demonstrate that both the major and minor Gas6 binding sites are required for productive transmembrane signalling. Gas6-mediated Axl dimerisation is likely to occur in two steps, with a high-affinity 1:1 Gas6/Axl complex forming first. Only the minor Gas6 binding site is highly conserved in the other Axl family receptors, Sky/Tyro3 and Mer. Specificity at the major contact is suggested to result from the segregation of charged and apolar residues to opposite faces of the newly formed beta-sheet.</p>
