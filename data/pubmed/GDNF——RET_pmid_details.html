                    <h2>Genomic structure and chromosomal localization of the human GDNFR-alpha gene.</h2>
                    <h3>Oncogene; 1998</h3>
                    <p>GDNFR-alpha is a glycosyl-phosphotidylinositol-linked receptor for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). GDNF binds to GDNFR-alpha and this complex, in turn, is believed to interact with the RET receptor tyrosine kinase to effect downstream signalling. GDNFR-alpha belongs to a novel gene family without strong homology to known genes. Thus, little information has been available to help predict genomic structure or location of this gene. In this study, the genomic organization of human GDNFR-alpha was delineated through a combination of PAC clone characterization, long distance PCR and sequence analyses. Exon-intron boundaries were defined by comparing the size and sequence of the genomic PCR products to those predicted by the cDNA sequence. The human GDNFR-alpha gene comprises 9 exons. GDNFR-alpha PAC clones were used for FISH analysis to map this gene to 10q26.</p>

                    <h2>TrnR2, a novel receptor that mediates neurturin and GDNF signaling through Ret.</h2>
                    <h3>Neuron; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) comprise a family of TGF-beta-related neurotrophic factors (TRNs), which have trophic influences on a variety of neuronal populations. A receptor complex comprised of TrnR1 (GDNFR alpha) and Ret was recently identified and found to be capable of mediating both GDNF and NTN signaling. We have identified a novel receptor based on homology to TrnR1, called TrnR2, that is 48% identical to TrnR1, and is located on the short arm of chromosome 8. TrnR2 is attached to the cell surface via a GPI-linkage, and can mediate both NTN and GDNF signaling through Ret in vitro. Fibroblasts expressing TrnR2 and Ret are approximately 30-fold more sensitive to NTN than to GDNF treatment, whereas those expressing TrnR1 and Ret respond equivalently to both factors, suggesting the TrnR2-Ret complex acts preferentially as a receptor for NTN. TrnR2 and Ret are expressed in neurons of the superior cervical and dorsal root ganglia, and in the adult brain. Comparative analysis of TrnR1, TrnR2, and Ret expression indicates that multiple receptor complexes, capable of mediating GDNF and NTN signaling, exist in vivo.</p>

                    <h2>Identification of a surface for binding to the GDNF-GFR alpha 1 complex in the first cadherin-like domain of RET.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is activated by binding to a ligand complex formed by a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of neurotrophic factors bound to its cognate GDNF-family receptor-alpha (GFR alpha) glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked co-receptor. Molecular modeling studies of the extracellular domain of RET (RETECD) have revealed the existence of four cadherin-like domains (CLD1-4) followed by a cysteine-rich domain. Cross-linking experiments have indicated that the RETECD makes direct contacts with both the GDNF ligand and GFR alpha 1 molecule in the complex, although it has low or no detectable affinity for either component alone. We have exploited sequence and functional divergences between the ectodomains of mammalian and amphibian RET molecules to map binding determinants in the human RETECD responsible for its interaction with the GDNF-GFR alpha 1 complex by homologue-scanning mutagenesis. We found that Xenopus RETECD was unable to bind to GDNF-GFR alpha-1 or neurturin (NTN)-GFR alpha-2 complexes of mammalian origin. However, a chimeric molecule containing CLD1, -2, and -3 from human RETECD, but neither domain alone, had similar binding activity as compared with wild type human RETECD, suggesting the existence of an extended ligand binding surface within the three N-terminal cadherin-like domains of human RETECD. Subsequent loss-of-function experiments at higher resolution identified three small subsets of residues, mapping on the same face of the molecular model of RET CLD1, that were required for the interaction of human RETECD with the GDNF-GFR alpha 1 complex. Additional experiments demonstrated that N-linked glycosylation of human RETECD was not required for ligand binding. Based on these observations, we propose a model for the assembly and architecture of the GDNF-GFR alpha 1-RET complex.</p>

                    <h2>GDNF-induced activation of the ret protein tyrosine kinase is mediated by GDNFR-alpha, a novel receptor for GDNF.</h2>
                    <h3>Cell; 1996</h3>
                    <p>We report the expression cloning and characterization of GDNFR-alpha, a novel glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface receptor for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). GDNFR-alpha binds GDNF specifically and mediates activation of the Ret protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK). Treatment of Neuro-2a cells expressing GDNFR-alpha with GDNF rapidly stimulates Ret autophosphorylation. Ret is also activated by treatment with a combination of GDNF and soluble GDNFR-alpha in cells lacking GDNFR-alpha, and this effect is blocked by a soluble Ret-Fc fusion protein. Ret activation by GDNF was also observed in cultured embryonic rat spinal cord motor neurons, a cell type that responds to GDNF in vivo. A model for the stepwise formation of a GDNF signal-transducing complex including GDNF, GDNFR-alpha, and the Ret PTK is proposed.</p>
