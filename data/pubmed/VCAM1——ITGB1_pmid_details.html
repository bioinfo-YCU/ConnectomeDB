                    <h2>A 3D structure model of integrin alpha 4 beta 1 complex: I. Construction of a homology model of beta 1 and ligand binding analysis.</h2>
                    <h3>Biophysical journal; 2002</h3>
                    <p>It is well established that integrin alpha 4 beta 1 binds to the vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and fibronectin and plays an important role in signal transduction. Blocking the binding of VCAM to alpha 4 beta 1 is thought to be a way of controlling a number of disease processes. To better understand how various inhibitors might block the interaction of VCAM and fibronectin with alpha 4 beta 1, we began constructing a structure model for the integrin alpha 4 beta 1 complex. As the first step, we have built a homology model of the beta 1 subunit based on the I domain of the integrin CD11B subunit. The model, including a bound Mg(2+) ion, was optimized through a specially designed relaxation scheme involving restrained minimization and dynamics steps. The native ligand VCAM and two highly active small molecules (TBC772 and TBC3486) shown to inhibit binding of CS-1 and VCAM to alpha 4 beta 1 were docked into the active site of the refined model. Results from the binding analysis fit well with a pharmacophore model that was independently derived from active analog studies. A critical examination of residues in the binding site and analysis of docked ligands that are both potent and selective led to the proposal of a mechanism for beta 1/beta 7 ligand binding selectivity.</p>

                    <h2>Both ICAM-1- and VCAM-1-integrin interactions are important in mediating monocyte adhesion to human saphenous vein.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of vascular research; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Atherosclerosis underlies late occlusion of human saphenous vein (HSV) coronary artery bypass grafts. Monocyte infiltration is implicated, but its mechanisms are unclear given that HSV normally expresses the ICAM-1 but not the VCAM-1 adhesion molecule. To define the mechanisms underlying monocyte adhesion, samples of HSV taken from coronary artery bypass graft patients were co-cultured with human monocytes and adherent monocytes were quantified by immunocytochemistry for CD68 on transverse sections. Pre-treatment of veins with anti-ICAM-1 antibodies reduced monocyte adhesion (monocytes/mm of section) from 7.2 +/- 1.5 to 3.1 +/- 0.7 (p < 0.05, n = 6), but the effect of anti-VCAM-1 was not significant (4.1 +/- 0.7). Paradoxically, pre-treatment of monocytes with either anti-beta(2)-integrins, the counter-receptor of ICAM-1, or anti-alpha(4) integrins, the counter-receptor of VCAM-1, significantly reduced adhesion (1.8 +/- 0.6 and 2.4 +/- 0.7, respectively, p < 0.05). These results were clarified by immunocytochemistry, which confirmed that VCAM-1 expression was absent in harvested vein but was induced in the endothelium during co-culture. Consistent with this, when anti-ICAM-1 or anti-VCAM-1 was present throughout co-culture, either of them reduced adhesion (from 4.2 +/- 0.9 to 2.3 +/- 0.5 and 2.2 +/- 0.4, respectively, p < 0.02, n = 8) and there was no further effect of adding both (2.0 +/- 0.5). These results demonstrate that both ICAM-1/beta(2) and VCAM-1/alpha(4) integrin interactions mediate monocyte adhesion to HSV, possibly as part of a common pathway. These experiments imply that either integrin might be targeted to reduce monocyte infiltration into HSV grafts.</p>

                    <h2>Vicious cycle between myeloma cell binding to bone marrow stromal cells via VLA-4-VCAM-1 adhesion and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha and MIP-1beta production.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of bone and mineral metabolism; 2009</h3>
                    <p>Multiple myeloma (MM) cell adhesion to stromal cells via very late antigen (VLA)-4 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 interaction causes enhanced secretion of osteoclastogenic activity by MM cells. We have reported that MM cell-derived macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta are responsible for most of the osteoclastogenic activity in MM. Thus, adhesion-mediated osteoclastogenesis may be caused by enhanced production of MIP-1 via VLA-4-VCAM-1 interaction. The present study was undertaken to clarify whether MM cell-derived MIP-1 plays a role in VLA-4-VCAM-1 adhesion-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Adhesion of MM cells to VCAM-1 upregulated MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta production from MM cells and enhanced production of osteoclastogenic activity by MM cells. Blockade of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta actions not only abrogated elaboration of osteoclastogenic activity, but also suppressed spontaneous MM cell adhesion to VCAM-1. These results demonstrate that MM cell adhesion to VCAM-1 upregulates MIP-1 production by MM cells to cause enhancement of osteoclastogenesis. In addition, the results suggest that the increased production of MIP-1 further enhances MM cell binding to stromal cells via stimulation of VLA-4-VCAM-1 adhesion, forming a "vicious cycle" between MM cell adhesion to stromal cells and MIP-1 production via VLA-4-VCAM-1 interaction.</p>
