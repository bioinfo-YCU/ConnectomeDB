                    <h2>Identification of receptors for neuromedin U and its role in feeding.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Neuromedin U (NMU) is a neuropeptide with potent activity on smooth muscle which was isolated first from porcine spinal cord and later from other species. It is widely distributed in the gut and central nervous system. Peripheral activities of NMU include stimulation of smooth muscle, increase of blood pressure, alteration of ion transport in the gut, control of local blood flow and regulation of adrenocortical function. An NMU receptor has not been molecularly identified. Here we show that the previously described orphan G-protein-coupled receptor FM-3 (ref. 15) and a newly discovered one (FM-4) are cognate receptors for NMU. FM-3, designated NMU1R, is abundantly expressed in peripheral tissues whereas FM-4, designated NMU2R, is expressed in specific regions of the brain. NMU is expressed in the ventromedial hypothalamus in the rat brain, and its level is significantly reduced following fasting. Intracerebroventricular administration of NMU markedly suppresses food intake in rats. These findings provide a molecular basis for the biochemical activities of NMU and may indicate that NMU is involved in the central control of feeding.</p>

                    <h2>Radioligand binding and functional characterization of recombinant human NmU1 and NmU2 receptors stably expressed in clonal human embryonic kidney-293 cells.</h2>
                    <h3>Pharmacology; 2004</h3>
                    <p>Neuromedin U (NmU) is a smooth muscle contracting peptide. Recently, two G-protein-coupled receptors for NmU (NmU1R and NmU2R) have been cloned having approximately 50% homology. They have distinct patterns of expression suggesting they may have different biological functions. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of both NmU receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. [125I]hNmU binding to the recombinant NmU receptors was rapid, saturable, of high affinity and to a single population of binding sites. Exposure of these cells to NmU isopeptides resulted in an increase in intracellular [Ca2+]i release (EC50 value of 0.50 +/- 0.10 nmol/l) and inositol phosphate formation (EC50 1.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.50 +/- 0.4 nmol/l for NmU1R and NmU2R respectively). Furthermore, hNmU inhibited forskolin (3 micromol/l)-stimulated accumulation of cAMP in intact HEK-293 cells expressing either NmU1R or NmU2R. The inhibitory effect was significant for the cells expressing NmU2R with IC50 value of 0.80 +/- 0.21 nmol/l. In summary, both NmU1R and NmU2R in HEK-293 cells have similar signaling capability.</p>

                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Two structurally related, G-protein-coupled receptors were identified as receptors for the neuropeptide, neuromedin U. This peptide is found in highest levels in the gut and genitourinary system where it potently contracts smooth muscle but is also expressed in the spinal cord and discrete regions of the brain. Binding sites for neuromedin U have been characterized in rat uterus, however, little is known about the activity of this peptide in the regions of the central nervous system where it is expressed. The receptors characterized in this report are activated by neuromedin U at nanomolar potency in heterologous expression systems and bind radiolabeled neuromedin U with high affinity. Localization of the receptor RNA by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in a variety of human tissues shows distinct expression patterns for the two receptors. NMU1 is expressed predominantly in peripheral tissues, whereas NMU2 is more highly expressed in the central nervous system. Identification of neuromedin U receptor subtypes will greatly aid in the determination of the physiological roles of this peptide.</p>

                    <h2>Signaling and ligand binding by recombinant neuromedin U receptors: evidence for dual coupling to Galphaq/11 and Galphai and an irreversible ligand-receptor interaction.</h2>
                    <h3>Molecular pharmacology; 2004</h3>
                    <p>The neuropeptide neuromedin U (NmU) shows considerable structural conservation across species. Within the body, it is widely distributed and in mammals has been implicated in physiological roles, including the regulation of feeding, anxiety, pain, blood flow, and smooth muscle contraction. Human NmU-25 (hNmU-25) and other NmU analogs were recently identified as ligands for two human orphan G protein-coupled receptors, subsequently named hNmU-R1 and hNmU-R2. These receptors have approximately 50% amino acid homology, and, at least in mammalian species, NmU-R1 and NmU-R2 are expressed predominantly in the periphery and central nervous system, respectively. Here, we have characterized signaling mediated by hNmU-R1 and hNmU-R2 expressed as recombinant proteins in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, particularly to define their G protein coupling and the activation and regulation of signal transduction pathways. We show that these receptors couple to both Galpha(q/11) and Galpha(i). Activation of either receptor type causes a pertussis toxin-insensitive activation of both phospholipase C and mitogen activated-protein kinase and a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with subnanomolar potency for each. Activation of phospholipase C is sustained, but despite this capacity for prolonged receptor activation, repetitive application of hNmU-25 does not cause repetitive intracellular Ca2+ signaling by either recombinant receptors or those expressed endogenously in isolated smooth muscle cells from rat fundus. Using several strategies, we show this to be a consequence of essentially irreversible binding of hNmU-25 to its receptors and that this is followed by ligand internalization. Despite structural differences between receptors, there were no apparent differences in their activation, coupling, or regulation.</p>

                    <h2>Identification and functional characterization of a novel subtype of neuromedin U receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Neuromedin U is a bioactive peptide isolated originally from the porcine spinal cord. We recently identified neuromedin U as the cognate ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor FM-3. In this study, we isolated cDNA coding for a novel G protein-coupled receptor, TGR-1, which was highly homologous with FM-3. We found that neuromedin U specifically and clearly elevated the extracellular acidification rates, arachidonic acid metabolite release, and intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing TGR-1. Radiolabeled neuromedin U specifically bound with high affinity to membrane fractions prepared from these cells. These results show that TGR-1, like FM-3, is a specific and functional receptor for neuromedin U. We analyzed TGR-1 mRNA tissue distribution in rats using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and found it to considerably differ from that of FM-3 mRNA. TGR-1 mRNA was primarily expressed in the uterus, suggesting that TGR-1 mediates the contractile activity of neuromedin U in this tissue. The identification of specific and functional receptor subtypes for neuromedin U will facilitate the study of their physiological roles and the search for their specific agonists and antagonists.</p>
