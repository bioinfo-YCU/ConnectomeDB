                    <h2>Solution structure of the epidermal growth factor-like domain of heregulin-alpha, a ligand for p180erbB-4.</h2>
                    <h3>The EMBO journal; 1994</h3>
                    <p>p185erbB-2 and p180erbB-4 are epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-like tyrosine kinases, whose co-expression is observed in many breast carcinomas. Heregulins (HRGs), which contain an immunoglobulin unit and an EGF-like domain, bind to p180erbB-4 and activate p180erbB-4 and p185erbB-2 through transphosphorylation or receptor heterodimerization. The EGF-like domain is sufficient for the activation. Despite the sequence similarity, no cross activity is seen between the p180erbB-4 ligands (HRGs) and the p170erbB-1 ligands [EGF and transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha]. To investigate the structural basis of receptor specificity, we have determined the solution structure of the EGF-like domain of HRG-alpha by two-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations. Though its main-chain fold is similar to those of EGF and TGF-alpha, distinctive structural features are observed on the molecular surface including an ionic cluster and hydrophobic patches, which afford HRG-alpha the specific affinity for p180erbB-4. The structure should provide a basis for the structure-activity relationship of HRGs and for the design of drugs which prevent progression of breast cancer.</p>

                    <h2>Expression of the c-erbB-3/HER-3 and c-erbB-4/HER-4 growth factor receptors and their ligands, neuregulin-1 alpha, neuregulin-1 beta, and betacellulin, in normal endometrium and endometrial cancer.</h2>
                    <h3>Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research; 1999</h3>
                    <p>The objective of this study was to determine the immunohistochemical expression of the c-erbB-3 and c-erbB-4 growth factor receptors and their principal ligands, the neuregulins and betacellulin, in normal endometrium and determine whether there was evidence of under- or overexpression in endometrial adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed using well-characterized antibodies against each of the five proteins analyzed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival material. Forty-three normal endometrial samples (16 proliferative, 19 secretory, and 8 hyperplastic) and 41 endometrial adenocarcinoma cases were analyzed. There was variable expression of the growth factor receptors and the ligands in the two principal phases of the menstrual cycle as well as in endometrial adenocarcinoma. In normal endometrium, the c-erbB-3 receptor was weakly expressed in both phases. The c-erbB-4 receptor and all of the ligands examined, neuregulin alpha, neuregulin beta, and betacellulin, were expressed at significantly higher levels in the secretory as compared with the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, suggesting a role for these proteins in endometrial maturation. In endometrial adenocarcinoma, overexpression of c-erbB-3, c-erbB-4, and betacellulin with underexpression of neuregulin a as compared with normal controls was observed. Neuregulin beta expression was not found to be significantly different in the two groups. These results suggest that signaling through the c-erbB-3 and c-erbB-4 receptors and the ligands neuregulin alpha, neuregulin beta, and betacellulin are important in endometrial carcinogenesis.</p>

                    <h2>The structural basis for the specificity of epidermal growth factor and heregulin binding.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Heregulin is a ligand for the erbB3 and erbB4 receptors, with a region of high homology to epidermal growth factor (EGF). Despite this homology, these ligands bind to their corresponding receptors with great specificity. We report here the synthesis of heregulin beta 177-241 and show that a region consisting of amino acids 177-226 is sufficient both for binding and stimulation of receptor phosphorylation. Studies of chimeric EGF/heregulin peptides revealed that amino acids 177-181 of heregulin provide the specificity for binding to the heregulin receptor. The substitution of amino acids 177-181 of heregulin for the N terminus of EGF produced a unique bifunctional agonist that binds with high affinity to both the EGF receptor and the heregulin receptor.</p>

                    <h2>Binding interaction of the heregulinbeta egf domain with ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors assessed by alanine scanning mutagenesis.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Individual residues of the heregulinbeta (HRG) egf domain were mutated to alanine and displayed monovalently on phagemid particles as gene III fusion proteins. Wild type HRGbeta egf domain displayed on phage was properly folded as evidenced by its ability to bind ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptor-IgG fusion proteins with affinities close to those measured for bacterially produced HRGbeta egf domain. Binding to ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors was affected by mutation of residues throughout the egf domain; including the NH2 terminus (His2 and Leu3), the two beta-turns (Val15-Gly18 and Gly42-Gln46), and some discontinuous residues (including Leu3, Val4, Phe13, Val23, and Leu33) that form a patch on the major beta-sheet and the COOH-terminal region (Tyr48 and Met50-Phe53). Binding affinity was least changed by mutations throughout the Omega-loop and the second strand of the major beta-sheet. More mutants had greater affinity loss for ErbB3 compared with ErbB4 implying that it has more stringent binding requirements. Many residues important for HRG binding to its receptors correspond to critical residues for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha binding to the EGF receptor. Specificity may be determined in part by bulky groups that prevent binding to the unwanted receptor. All of the mutants tested were able to induce phosphorylation and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation through ErbB4 receptors and were able to modulate a transphosphorylation signal from ErbB3 to ErbB2 in MCF7 cells. An understanding of binding similarities and differences among the EGF family of ligands may facilitate the development of egf-like analogs with broad or narrow specificity.</p>
