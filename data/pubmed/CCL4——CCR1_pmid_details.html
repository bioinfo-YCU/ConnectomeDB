                    <h2>Pharmacological characterization of the chemokine receptor, hCCR1 in a stable transfectant and differentiated HL-60 cells: antagonism of hCCR1 activation by MIP-1beta.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>C-C chemokine receptor-1 (CCR1) has been implicated in mediating a variety of inflammatory conditions including multiple sclerosis and organ rejection. Although originally referred to as the MIP-1alpha/RANTES receptor, CCR1 is quite promiscuous and can be activated by numerous chemokines. We used radioligand binding and [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays in membranes from a cell line transfected to express CCR1 (Ba/F3-hCCR1) to characterize a panel of chemokines (HCC-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MIP-1delta, MPIF-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and RANTES) as CCR1 ligands. In this recombinant model, these chemokines displaced 125I-MIP-1alpha with a wide range of potencies and, with the exception of MCP-2, acted as full agonists in stimulating [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange. We then assessed the utility of HL-60 cells cultured with known differentiating agents (PMA, DMSO, dibutyryl-cAMP or retinoic acid) for investigating CCR1 pharmacology. In [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, membranes from cells cultured with retinoic acid (4-6 days) were the most responsive to activation by MIP-1alpha and MPIF-1. FACS analysis and comparative pharmacology confirmed that these activities were mediated by CCR1. Using [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, intracellular calcium flux and/or whole cell chemotaxis assays in HL-60(Rx) cells, we validated that MIP-1alpha was the most potent CCR1 ligand (MIP-1alpha>MPIF-1>RANTES>or=MIP-1beta) although the ligands differed in their efficacy as agonists. MPIF-1 was the more efficacious (MPIF-1>RANTES=MIP-1alpha>>MIP-1beta). 125I-MIP-1beta binding in Ba/F3-hCCR1 and HL-60(Rx) membranes was competitively displaced by MIP-1alpha, MPIF-1 and MIP-1beta. The binding K(i) for these chemokines with 125I-MIP-1beta were essentially identical in the two membrane systems. Lastly, MIP-1beta antagonized [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange, Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis in HL-60(Rx) cells in response to robust agonists such as MIP-1alpha, RANTES and MPIF-1. Based on our results, we propose that MIP-1beta could function as an endogenous inhibitor of CCR1 function.</p>

                    <h2>Monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 is a functional ligand for CC chemokine receptors 1 and 2B.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The CC chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3) activates human monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. MCP-3 has been reported to induce [Ca2+]i changes in cells transfected with the monocyte-selective MCP-1 receptor 2B (CC CKR2B) and competes for 125I-MCP-1 binding on CC CKR2B, suggesting that it may mediate monocyte responses to MCP-3. However, we now show that MCP-3 is a ligand and potent agonist for the macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha)/regulated on activation, normal T expressed, and secreted protein (RANTES) receptor CC CKR1 (rank order for [Ca2+]i changes = MIP-1 alpha > MCP-3 > RANTES), which is expressed in monocytes > neutrophils > eosinophils. 125I-MCP-3 bound directly to CC CKR1 and CC CKR2B (Ki = 8 and 7 nM, respectively). Binding to CC CKR1 was competed by all CC chemokines tested except MCP-1. In contrast, binding to CC CKR2B was competed only by MCP-3 and MCP-1. Both MCP-1 and MCP-3 were equipotent agonists (EC50 = 10 nM for [Ca2+]i changes). Thus, MCP-3 is a functional ligand for both CC CKR1 and CC CKR2B, which otherwise have distinct selectivities for CC chemokines. These data suggest that monocyte responses to MCP-3 could be mediated by both CC CKR2B and CC CKR1, whereas eosinophil responses to MCP-3 could be mediated by CC CKR1.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular characterization of two murine eosinophil beta chemokine receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950); 1995</h3>
                    <p>beta or C-C chemokines including RANTES, MCP-3, MIP-1 alpha, and eotaxin have been implicated in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic inflammation. Two human beta chemokine receptors have been cloned and characterized: the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor or C-C chemokine receptor 1 (CCR-1) and the MCP-1 receptor or C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR-2). However, no murine beta chemokine receptors have thus far been reported. Molecular cloning from mouse genomic DNA and cDNA libraries yielded two murine beta chemokine receptors with 79% and 65% sequence identity with human CCR-1, and 50% and 55% with human CCR-2. COS cells transiently transfected with the murine homologue of human CCR-1 bind murine MIP-1 alpha and human RANTES with Kds of 3.4 nM and 4.2 nM and murine MIP-1 beta with an EC50 of 8.9 nM. The other murine beta chemokine receptor, which we have designated murine CCR-3, also binds murine MIP-1 alpha. The mRNAs for both receptors are expressed in eosinophils from IL-5 transgenic mice. The level of murine CCR-3 mRNA in these mouse eosinophils exceeds that of CCR-1 mRNA and approaches actin levels. Murine MIP-1 alpha was found to be a potent chemoattractant for murine eosinophils. Our findings suggest that the murine MIP-1 alpha ligand/receptor system is an important mediator of murine eosinophil trafficking.</p>
