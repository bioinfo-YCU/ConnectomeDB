                    <h2>Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.</p>

                    <h2>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A165-induced prostacyclin synthesis requires the activation of VEGF receptor-1 and -2 heterodimer.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2005</h3>
                    <p>We previously reported that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A(165) inflammatory effect is mediated by acute platelet-activating factor synthesis from endothelial cells upon the activation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and its coreceptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). In addition, VEGF-A(165) promotes the release of other endothelial mediators including nitric oxide and prostacyclin (PGI(2)). However, it is unknown whether VEGF-A(165) is mediating PGI(2) synthesis through VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and/or VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) activation and whether the coreceptor NRP-1 potentiates VEGF-A(165) activity. In this study, PGI(2) synthesis in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) was assessed by quantifying its stable metabolite (6-keto prostaglandin F(1alpha), 6-keto PGF(1alpha)) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment of BAEC with VEGF analogs, VEGF-A(165) (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 agonist) and VEGF-A(121) (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonist) (up to 10(-9) m), increased PGI(2) synthesis by 70- and 40-fold within 15 min. Treatment with VEGFR-1 (placental growth factor and VEGF-B) or VEGFR-2 (VEGF-C) agonist did not increase PGI(2) synthesis. The combination of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonists did not increase PGI(2) release. Pretreatment with a VEGFR-2 inhibitor abrogated PGI(2) release mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121), and pretreatment of BAEC with antisense oligomers targeting VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 mRNA reduced PGI(2) synthesis mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121) up to 79%. In summary, our data demonstrate that the activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 heterodimer (VEGFR-1/R-2) is essential for PGI(2) synthesis mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121), which cannot be reproduced by the parallel activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 homodimers with corresponding agonists. In addition, the binding of VEGF-A(165) to NRP-1 potentiates its capacity to promote PGI(2) synthesis.</p>

                    <h2>Semaphorin-4A, an activator for T-cell-mediated immunity, suppresses angiogenesis via Plexin-D1.</h2>
                    <h3>The EMBO journal; 2007</h3>
                    <p>Originally identified as axon guidance molecules, semaphorins are now known to be widely expressed mediators that play significant roles in immune responses and organ morphogenesis. However, not much is known about the signaling pathways via which they exert their organ-specific effects. Here we demonstrate that Sema4A, previously identified as an activator of T-cell-mediated immunity, is expressed in endothelial cells, where it suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated endothelial cell migration and proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. Mice lacking Sema4A exhibit enhanced angiogenesis in response to VEGF or inflammatory stimuli. In addition, binding and functional experiments revealed Plexin-D1 to be a receptor for Sema4A on endothelial cells, indicating that Sema4A exerts organ-specific activities via different receptor-mediated signaling pathways: via Plexin-D1 in the endothelial cells and via T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-2 in T cells. The effects of Sema4A on endothelial cells are dependent on its ability to suppress VEGF-mediated Rac activation and integrin-dependent cell adhesion. It thus appears that Sema4A-Plexin-D1 signaling negatively regulates angiogenesis.</p>
