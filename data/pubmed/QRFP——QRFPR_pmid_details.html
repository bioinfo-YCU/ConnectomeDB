                    <h2>Identification and characterization of a novel RF-amide peptide ligand for orphan G-protein-coupled receptor SP9155.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Orphan G-protein-coupled receptors are a large class of receptors whose cognate ligands are unknown. SP9155 (also referred to as AQ27 and GPR103) is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor originally cloned from a human brain cDNA library. SP9155 was found to be predominantly expressed in brain, heart, kidney, retina, and testis. Phylogenetic analysis shows that SP9155 shares high homology with Orexin, NPFF, and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors, but identification of the endogenous ligand for SP9155 has not been reported. In this study, we have used a novel method to predict peptides from genome data bases. From these predicted peptides, a novel RF-amide peptide, P52 was shown to selectively activate SP9155-transfected cells. We subsequently cloned the precursor gene of the P52 ligand and characterized the activity of other possible peptides encoded by the precursor. This revealed an extended peptide, P518, which exhibited high affinity for SP9155 (EC50 = 7 nm). mRNA expression analysis revealed that the peptide P518 precursor gene is predominantly expressed in various brain regions, coronary arteries, thyroid and parathyroid glands, large intestine, colon, bladder, testes, and prostate. These results indicate the existence of a novel RF-amide neuroendocrine peptide system, and suggest that SP9155 is likely the relevant G-protein-coupled receptor for this peptide.</p>

                    <h2>Recent advances in mammalian RFamide peptides: the discovery and functional analyses of PrRP, RFRPs and QRFP.</h2>
                    <h3>Peptides; 2006</h3>
                    <p>Since the first discovery of a peptide with RFamide structure at its C-terminus (i.e., an RFamide peptide) from an invertebrate in 1977, numerous studies on RFamide peptides have been conducted, and a variety have been identified in various phyla throughout the animal kingdom. The first reported mammalian RFamide peptides were neuropeptide FF (NPFF) and neuropeptide AF (NPAF) in 1985. However, for many years after this, no new novel RFamide peptides were identified in mammals. A breakthrough in discovering mammalian RFamide peptides was made possible by reverse pharmacology on the basis of orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) research. The first report of an RFamide peptide identified from orphan GPCR research was prolactin (PRL)-releasing peptide (PrRP) in 1998. To date, a total of five RFamide peptide genes have been discovered in mammals. Orphan GPCR research has contributed considerably to the identification of these peptides and their receptor genes. This paper examines these mammalian RFamide peptides focusing especially on PrRP, RFamide-related peptides (RFRPs) and, the most recently identified, pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide (QRFP), the discovery of all of which the authors were at least partly involved in. We review here the strategies employed for the identification of these peptides and examine their characteristics, tissue distribution, receptors and functions.</p>

                    <h2>Screening β-arrestin recruitment for the identification of natural ligands for orphan G-protein-coupled receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of biomolecular screening; 2013</h3>
                    <p>A variety of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) screening technologies have successfully partnered a number of GPCRs with their cognate ligands. GPCR-mediated β-arrestin recruitment is now recognized as a distinct intracellular signaling pathway, and ligand-receptor interactions may show a bias toward β-arrestin over classical GPCR signaling pathways. We hypothesized that the failure to identify native ligands for the remaining orphan GPCRs may be a consequence of biased β-arrestin signaling. To investigate this, we assembled 10 500 candidate ligands and screened 82 GPCRs using PathHunter β-arrestin recruitment technology. High-quality screening assays were validated by the inclusion of liganded receptors and the detection and confirmation of these established ligand-receptor pairings. We describe a candidate endogenous orphan GPCR ligand and a number of novel surrogate ligands. However, for the majority of orphan receptors studied, measurement of β-arrestin recruitment did not lead to the identification of cognate ligands from our screening sets. β-Arrestin recruitment represents a robust GPCR screening technology, and ligand-biased signaling is emerging as a therapeutically exploitable feature of GPCR biology. The identification of cognate ligands for the orphan GPCRs and the extent to which receptors may exist to preferentially signal through β-arrestin in response to their native ligand remain to be determined.</p>
