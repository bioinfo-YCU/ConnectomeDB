                    <h2>Distinct ligand-binding modes for integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion to fibronectin versus vitronectin.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Cell surface integrins can adopt distinct conformations in response to ligand binding and intracellular signals. Several integrins including alpha(v)beta(3) can bind to multiple ligands. The binding of alpha(v)beta(3) to fibronectin and vitronectin was used as a model to determine whether the same or distinct forms of the receptor were utilized in strong binding to the two different ligands. A spinning-disc device was used to measure the relative strength of the alpha(v)beta(3)-ligand bonds. The initial binding reaction for both ligands occurred in the absence of metabolic energy and resulted in a strong adhesion to fibronectin but a weak adhesion to vitronectin. Increases in the strength of the alpha(v)beta(3)-vitronectin bond required phosphorylation of the beta(3) cytoplasmic domain, intracellular signals, and the binding of cytoskeletal proteins to cytoplasmic domains of beta(3) controlled by Tyr-747 and Tyr-759. In contrast, alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion to fibronectin was unaffected by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, mutations of Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 to phenylalanine, or availability of metabolic energy. This suggests that strong adhesion to fibronectin used the initial binding conformation, whereas strong binding to vitronectin required signaling-induced changes in the conformation of alpha(v)beta(3).</p>

                    <h2>Identification of a novel binding site to the integrin alphaIIbbeta3 located in the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of human plasma fibronectin.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Fibronectin has been shown to bind to integrin alphaIIbbeta3 in Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-dependent and -independent manners. A recent study has indicated that a 29-kDa dispase-digestive fragment from the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of human plasma fibronectin (lacking RGD sequence) inhibits binding of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets and ADP-induced aggregation (Tanabe, J. , Fujita, H., Iwamatsu, A., Mohri, H., and Ohkubo, T.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 27143-27147). We provide here the evidence that a peptide corresponding to residues from Ala1704 to Glu1718 (designated F1) from this fragment inhibited binding of 125I-labeled 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets and ADP-induced aggregation. The F1 peptide bound directly to alphaIIbbeta3 integrin receptor. These results indicate that a novel binding site in the C-terminal heparin-binding region of fibronectin is localized within the residues from Ala1704 to Glu1718. Binding of 125I-labeled 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets was not inhibited by RGDS peptide and the 12-residue peptide from the cell-binding domain of fibronectin, suggesting that binding site in the C-terminal heparin-binding domain may be different from those of RGDS and the 12-residue peptide. This additional alphaIIbbeta3-binding domain(s) in fibronectin may also play some role for prevention of thrombus formation by direct interaction with alphaIIbbeta3.</p>

                    <h2>Purification and functional characterization of integrin alpha v beta 5. An adhesion receptor for vitronectin.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1990</h3>
                    <p>We have purified a novel member of the integrin gene family from placenta that serves as a vitronectin receptor. This integrin is composed of the alpha v subunit and a beta subunit that we designate beta 5. Purification was accomplished by immunodepleting a placental extract of integrin alpha v beta 3, allowing us to purify alpha v beta 5 from the remaining extract by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography on LM 142-Sepharose, which binds to the alpha v subunit. Purification to homogeneity was subsequently achieved by affinity chromatography on wheat germ lectin-Sepharose. Western blot analysis with antibodies raised against alpha v beta 5 and alpha v beta 3 demonstrated that beta 3 and beta 5 were distinct but confirmed that the alpha subunit of the two integrins were immunologically identical. Similarly, antibodies that bind beta 3 proximal to the ligand-binding site failed to react with beta 5, indicating an architectural difference at the ligand-binding site of these related integrins. This structural difference apparently results in a functional distinction, since purified alpha v beta 3 bound to vitronectin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin, whereas integrin alpha v beta 5 bound preferentially to vitronectin. Finally, we demonstrate by three criteria that beta 5 and beta x, the latter of which was identified in lung carcinoma cells (Cheresh, D. A., Smith, J. W., Cooper, H. M., and Quaranta, V. (1989) Cell 57, 59-69), are identical. First, peptide maps of beta x and beta 5 are identical. Secondly, polyclonal antibodies raised against alpha v beta 5 immunoprecipitate both beta 5 and beta x, and finally, the amino-terminal amino acid sequences of beta x and beta 5 are identical.</p>
