                    <h2>Crystal structure of the human TbetaR2 ectodomain--TGF-beta3 complex.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature structural biology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is the prototype of a large family of structurally related cytokines that play key roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis by signaling through two classes of functionally distinct Ser/Thr kinase receptors, designated as type I and type II. TGF-beta initiates receptor assembly by binding with high affinity to the type II receptor. Here, we present the 2.15 A crystal structure of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human TGF-beta type II receptor (ecTbetaR2) in complex with human TGF-beta3. ecTbetaR2 interacts with homodimeric TGF-beta3 by binding identical finger segments at opposite ends of the growth factor. Relative to the canonical 'closed' conformation previously observed in ligand structures across the superfamily, ecTbetaR2-bound TGF-beta3 shows an altered arrangement of its monomeric subunits, designated the 'open' conformation. The mode of TGF-beta3 binding shown by ecTbetaR2 is compatible with both ligand conformations. This, in addition to the predicted mode for TGF-beta binding to the type I receptor ectodomain (ecTbetaR1), suggests an assembly mechanism in which ecTbetaR1 and ecTbetaR2 bind at adjacent positions on the ligand surface and directly contact each other via protein--protein interactions.</p>

                    <h2>Real-time monitoring of the interactions of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta ) isoforms with latency-associated protein and the ectodomains of the TGF-beta type II and III receptors reveals different kinetic models and stoichiometries of binding.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Mature transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is proteolytically derived from the C terminus of a precursor protein. Latency-associated protein (LAP), the N-terminal remnant of the TGF-beta precursor, is able to bind and neutralize TGF-beta. Mature TGF-beta exerts its activity by binding and complexing members of two subfamilies of receptors, the type I and II receptors. In addition to these signaling receptors, TGF-beta can also interact with an accessory receptor termed the type III receptor. Using a surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor (BIAcore), we determined the mechanisms of interaction of four binding proteins (LAP, the type II and III receptor ectodomains (EDs), and a type II receptor ED/Fc chimera) with three TGF-beta isoforms, and we quantified their related kinetic parameters. Using global fitting based on a numerical integration data analysis method, we demonstrated that LAP and the type II receptor/Fc chimera interacted with the TGF-beta isoforms with a 1:1 stoichiometry. In contrast, the type II ED interactions with TGF-beta were best fit by a kinetic model assuming the presence of two independent binding sites on the ligand molecule. We also showed that the type III ED bound two TGF-beta molecules. Further experiments revealed that LAP was able to block the interactions of TGF-beta with the two EDs, but that the two EDs did not compete or cooperate with each other. Together, these results strongly support the existence of a cell-surface complex consisting of one type III receptor, two TGF-beta molecules, and four type II receptors, prior to the recruitment of the type I receptor for signal transduction. Additionally, our results indicate that the apparent dissociation rate constants are more predictive of the neutralizing potency of these TGF-beta-binding proteins (LAP, the type II and III receptor EDs, and the type II receptor/Fc chimera) than the apparent equilibrium constants.</p>

                    <h2>Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) binding to the extracellular domain of the type II TGF-beta receptor: receptor capture on a biosensor surface using a new coiled-coil capture system demonstrates that avidity contributes significantly to high affinity binding.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of molecular biology; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Mature TGF-beta isoforms, which are covalent dimers, signal by binding to three types of cell surface receptors, the type I, II and III TGF-beta receptors. A complex composed of the TGF-beta ligand and the type I and II receptors is required for signaling. The type II receptor is responsible for recruiting TGF-beta into the heteromeric ligand/type I receptor/type II receptor complex. The purpose of this study was to test for the extent that avidity contributes to receptor affinity. Using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor (the BIACORE), we captured the extracellular domain of the type II receptor (TbetaRIIED) at the biosensor surface in an oriented and stable manner by using a de novo designed coiled-coil (E/K coil) heterodimerizing system. We characterized the kinetics of binding of three TGF-beta isoforms to this immobilized TbetaRIIED. The results demonstrate that the stoichiometry of TGF-beta binding to TbetaRIIED was one dimeric ligand to two receptors. All three TGF-beta isoforms had rapid and similar association rates, but different dissociation rates, which resulted in the equilibrium dissociation constants being approximately 5pM for the TGF-beta1 and -beta3 isoforms, and 5nM for the TGF-beta2 isoform. Since these apparent affinities are at least four orders of magnitude higher than those determined when TGF-beta was immobilized, and are close to those determined for TbetaRII at the cell surface, we suggest that avidity contributes significantly to high affinity receptor binding both at the biosensor and cell surfaces. Finally, we demonstrated that the coiled-coil immobilization approach does not require the purification of the captured protein, making it an attractive tool for the rapid study of any protein-protein interaction.</p>

                    <h2>Betaglycan can act as a dual modulator of TGF-beta access to signaling receptors: mapping of ligand binding and GAG attachment sites.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of cell biology; 1994</h3>
                    <p>Betaglycan, also known as the TGF-beta type III receptor, is a membrane-anchored proteoglycan that presents TGF-beta to the type II signaling receptor, a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase. The betaglycan extracellular region, which can be shed by cells into the medium, contains a NH2-terminal domain related to endoglin and a COOH-terminal domain related to uromodulin, sperm receptors Zp2 and 3, and pancreatic secretory granule GP-2 protein. We identified residues Ser535 and Ser546 in the uromodulin-related region as the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment sites. Their mutation to alanine prevents GAG attachment but does not interfere with betaglycan stability or ability to bind and present TGF-beta to receptor II. Using a panel of deletion mutants, we found that TGF-beta binds to the NH2-terminal endoglin-related region of betaglycan. The remainder of the extracellular domain and the cytoplasmic domain are not required for presentation of TGF-beta to receptor II; however, membrane anchorage is required. Soluble betaglycan can bind TGF-beta but does not enhance binding to membrane receptors. In fact, recombinant soluble betaglycan acts as potent inhibitor of TGF-beta binding to membrane receptors and blocks TGF-beta action, this effect being particularly pronounced with the TGF-beta 2 isoform. The results suggest that release of betaglycan into the medium converts this enhancer of TGF-beta action into a TGF-beta antagonist.</p>
