                    <h2>CXCL16 signals via Gi, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, I kappa B kinase, and nuclear factor-kappa B and induces cell-cell adhesion and aortic smooth muscle cell proliferation.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2004</h3>
                    <p>CXCL16, a recently discovered transmembrane chemokine, is expressed in human aortic smooth muscle cell (ASMC). It facilitates uptake of low density lipoproteins by macrophages, resulting in foam cell formation. However, it is not known whether ASMC express CXCR6, the receptor for CXCL16, or whether CXCL16 affects ASMC biology. To dissect the biological and signal transduction pathways elicited by CXCL16, human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were treated with pharmacological inhibitors or transiently transfected with pathway-specific dominant-negative or kinase-dead expression vectors prior to the addition of CXCL16. HASMC expressed CXCR6 at basal conditions. Exposure of HASMC to CXCL16 increased NF-kappa B DNA binding activity, induced kappa B-driven luciferase activity, and up-regulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in an NF-kappa B-dependent manner. However, treatment with pertussis toxin (G(i) inhibitor), wortmannin or LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K inhibitors)), or Akt inhibitor or overexpression of dominant-negative (dn) PI3K gamma, dnPDK-1, kinase-dead (kd) Akt, kdIKK-beta, dnIKK-gamma, dnI kappa B-alpha, or dnI kappa B-beta significantly attenuated CXCL16-induced NF-kappa B activation. Furthermore, CXCL16 increased cell-cell adhesion and induced cellular proliferation in an NF-kappa B-dependent manner. In conclusion, CXCL16 is a potent and direct activator of NF-kappaB and induces kappa B-dependent proinflammatory gene transcription. CXCL16-mediated NF-kappa B activation occurred via heterotrimeric G proteins, PI3K, PDK-1, Akt, and I kappa B kinase (IKK). CXCL16 induced I kappa B phosphorylation and degradation. Most importantly, CXCL16 increased cell-cell adhesion and induced kappa B-dependent ASMC proliferation, indicating that CXCL16 may play an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease.</p>

                    <h2>Expression cloning of the STRL33/BONZO/TYMSTRligand reveals elements of CC, CXC, and CX3C chemokines.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950); 2001</h3>
                    <p>STRL33/BONZO/TYMSTR is an orphan chemokine and HIV/SIV coreceptor receptor that is expressed on activated T lymphocytes. We describe an expression cloning strategy whereby we isolated a novel chemokine, which we name CXCL16. CXCL16 is an alpha (CXC) chemokine but also has characteristics of CC chemokines and a structure similar to fractalkine (neurotactin) in having a transmembrane region and a chemokine domain suspended by a mucin-like stalk. A recombinant version of CXCL16 fails to mediate chemotaxis to all known chemokine receptor transfectants tested but does mediate robust chemotaxis, high affinity binding, and calcium mobilization to Bonzo receptor transfectants, indicating that this is a unique receptor ligand interaction. In vitro polarized T cell subsets including Th1, Th2, and Tr1 cells express functional Bonzo, suggesting expression of this receptor in chronic inflammation, which we further verified by demonstration of CXCL16-mediated migration of tonsil-derived CD4(+) T lymphocytes. CXCL16 is expressed on the surface of APCs including subsets of CD19(+) B cells and CD14(+) monocyte/macrophages, and functional CXCL16 is also shed from macrophages. The combination of unique structural features of both Bonzo and CXCL16 suggest that this interaction may represent a new class of ligands for this receptor family. Additionally, this chemokine might play a unique dual role of attracting activated lymphocyte subsets during inflammation as well as facilitating immune responses via cell-cell contact.</p>

                    <h2>A transmembrane CXC chemokine is a ligand for HIV-coreceptor Bonzo.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature immunology; 2000</h3>
                    <p>We describe a protein with the hallmarks of a chemokine, designated CXCL16, that is made by dendritic cells (DCs) in lymphoid organ T cell zones and by cells in the splenic red pulp. CXCL16 contains a transmembrane domain and both membrane-bound and soluble forms are produced. Naïve CD8 T cells, natural killer T cells and a subset of memory CD4 T cells bind CXCL16, and activated T cells migrated chemotactically to the soluble chemokine. By expression cloning, Bonzo (also known as STRL33 and TYMSTR) was identified as a CXCL16 receptor. CXCL16 may function in promoting interactions between DCs and CD8 T cells and in guiding T cell movements in the splenic red pulp. CXCL16 was also found in the thymic medulla and in some nonlymphoid tissues, indicating roles in thymocyte development and effector T cell trafficking.</p>
