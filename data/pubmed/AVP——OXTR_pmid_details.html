                    <h2>[1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] arginine vasopressin: a potent and specific agonist for vasopressin V1b receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrinology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>To date, there are no vasopressin (VP) agonists that exhibit a high affinity and selectivity for the VP V1b receptor with respect to the V1a, V2, and oxytocin receptors. In this study, we describe the synthesis and pharmacological properties of [1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] arginine vasopressin (d[Cha4]AVP). Binding experiments performed on various membrane preparations revealed that d[Cha(4)]AVP exhibits a nanomolar affinity for V1b receptors from various mammalian species (rat, bovine, human). It exhibits high V1b/V1a and V1b/oxytocin selectivity for rat, human, and bovine receptors. Furthermore, it exhibits high V1b/V2 specificity for both bovine and human vasopressin receptors. Functional studies performed on biological models that naturally express V1b receptors indicate that d[Cha4]AVP is an agonist. Like VP, it stimulated basal and corticotropin-releasing factor-stimulated ACTH secretion and basal catecholamine release from rat anterior pituitary and bovine chromaffin cells, respectively. In vivo experiments performed in rat revealed that d[Cha4]AVP was able to stimulate both ACTH and corticosterone secretion and exhibits negligible vasopressor activity. It retains about 30% of the antidiuretic activity of VP. This long-sought selective VP V1b receptor ligand with nanomolar affinity will allow a better understanding of V1b-mediated VP physiological effects and is a promising new tool for V1b receptor structure-function studies.</p>

                    <h2>Design of potent and selective agonists for the human vasopressin V1b receptor based on modifications of [deamino-cys1]arginine vasopressin at position 4.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of medicinal chemistry; 2004</h3>
                    <p>The glutamine(4) residue in [deamino-Cys(1)]arginine vasopressin (dAVP) was replaced by a broad series of aliphatic, aromatic, polar, and charged amino acids to give the following peptides: d[Gly(4)]AVP (1), d[Ala(4)]AVP (2), d[Abu(4)]AVP (3), d[Nva(4)]AVP (4), d[Nle(4)]AVP (5), d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Ile(4)]AVP (7), d[Thi(4)]AVP (8), d[Phe(4)]AVP (9), d[Tyr(4)]AVP (10), d[Trp(4)]AVP (11), d[Asn(4)]AVP (12), d[Ser(4)]AVP (13), d[Thr(4)]AVP (14), d[Dap(4)]AVP (15), d[Dab(4)]AVP (16), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), d[Har(4)]AVP (20), and d[Glu(4)]AVP (21). All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods using BOC chemistry for all but one peptide (8), which required the use of Fmoc chemistry. The binding and functional properties of these position 4 substituted analogues of dAVP (d[X(4)]AVP) and the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP (Derick et al. Endocrinology 2002, 143, 4655-4664) were evaluated on human arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1a), V(1b), and V(2) receptors and on the human oxytocin (OT) receptor expressed in living Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Binding studies revealed that broad modifications of the fourth residue of dAVP do not significantly alter affinity for the human V(1b) receptor. Only aromatic (Phe, Tyr, Trp) or negatively charged (Glu) residues reduce V(1b) affinity. By contrast, the human V(1a) and more particularly the human V(2) and the OT receptors are more sensitive to many of these modifications. Thus, the replacement of the Gln(4) residue of dAVP by aliphatic (Leu, Cha) or positively charged (Orn, Lys, Arg, Har) amino acids led to analogues exhibiting drastic reductions of their affinity for the human V(1a), V(2), and OT receptors. Consequently, in addition to the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP, peptides 6 and 17-20 display excellent selectivities for the human V(1b) receptor. The key structural requirement responsible for optimal V(1b) selectivity appears to be the length and branching of the aliphatic side chain of the fourth residue of dAVP. Functional studies performed on CHO cells expressing the different human AVP/OT receptors confirm the V(1b) selectivity of peptides 6, 17, 18, 20, and d[Cha(4)]AVP. However, d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), which triggers an excellent coupling between the human V(2) receptor and adenylyl cyclase, was found to exhibit both V(1b) and V(2) agonism in functional tests. More interestingly, these functional experiments revealed that, depending on the AVP/OT receptor, a given d[X(4)]AVP analogue may behave as a full agonist or as a partial agonist. This strongly suggests that the fourth residue of dAVP plays an important role in the coupling between the hormone-receptor complex, the heterotrimeric G protein, and the effectors. In conclusion, the synthesis of these d[X(4)]AVP analogues led to the discovery of new V(1b) agonists with high affinity and greatly enhanced selectivities. Thus, in addition to d[Cha(4)]AVP, d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), and d[Har(4)]AVP (20) are useful new tools for studying the structure and the function of the human V(1b) receptor.</p>

                    <h2>Tyr115 is the key residue for determining agonist selectivity in the V1a vasopressin receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The EMBO journal; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Using a three-dimensional model of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), we have previously succeeded in docking the neurohypophysial hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) into the V1a receptor. According to this model, the hormone is completely embedded in the transmembrane part of the receptor. Only the side chain of the Arg residue at position 8 projects outside the transmembrane core of the receptor and possibly interacts with a Tyr residue located in the first extracellular loop at position 115. Residue 8 varies in the two natural neurohypophysial hormones, AVP and oxytocin (OT); similarly, different residues are present at position 115 in the different members of the AVP/OT receptor family. Here we show that Arg8 is crucial for high affinity binding of AVP to the rat V1a receptor. Moreover, when Tyr115 is replaced by an Asp and a Phe, the amino acids naturally occurring in the V2 and in the OT receptor subtypes, the agonist selectivity of the V1a receptor switches accordingly. Our results indicate that the interaction between peptide residue 8 and the receptor residue at position 115 is not only crucial for agonist high affinity binding but also for receptor selectivity.</p>

                    <h2>Direct identification of human oxytocin receptor-binding domains using a photoactivatable cyclic peptide antagonist: comparison with the human V1a vasopressin receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Understanding of the molecular determinants responsible for antagonist binding to the oxytocin receptor should provide important insights that facilitate rational design of potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of preterm labor. To study ligand/receptor interactions, we used a novel photosensitive radioiodinated antagonist of the human oxytocin receptor, d(CH(2))(5) [Tyr(Me)(2),Thr(4),Orn(8),Phe(3(125)I,4N(3))-NH(2)9]vasotocin. This ligand had an equivalent high affinity for human oxytocin and V(1a) vasopressin receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Taking advantage of this dual specificity, we conducted photoaffinity labeling experiments on both receptors. Photolabeled oxytocin and V(1a) receptors appeared as a unique protein band at 70-75 kDa and two labeled protein bands at 85-90 and 46 kDa, respectively. To identify contact sites between the antagonist and the receptors, the labeled 70-75- and the 46-kDa proteins were cleaved with CNBr and digested with Lys-C and Arg-C endoproteinases. The fragmentation patterns allowed the identification of a covalently labeled region in the oxytocin receptor transmembrane domain III consisting of the residues Leu(114)-Val(115)-Lys(116). Analysis of contact sites in the V(1a) receptor led to the identification of the homologous region consisting of the residues Val(126)-Val(127)-Lys(128). Binding domains were confirmed by mutation of several CNBr cleavage sites in the oxytocin receptor and of one Lys-C cleavage site in the V(1a) receptor. The results are in agreement with previous experimental data and three-dimensional models of agonist and antagonist binding to members of the oxytocin/vasopressin receptor family.</p>

                    <h2>Selectivity of d[Cha4]AVP and SSR149415 at human vasopressin and oxytocin receptors: evidence that SSR149415 is a mixed vasopressin V1b/oxytocin receptor antagonist.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2005</h3>
                    <p>1 A possible role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1b) receptor subtype in stress-related disorders has been recently highlighted by the discovery of the agonist [1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] AVP (d[Cha(4)]AVP) and the antagonist SSR149415. Both compounds have been proposed to target specifically V(1b) receptors, since the reported affinities for the related V(1a), V(2) and oxytocin receptors are in the micromolar or submicromolar range. In the present study, we further investigated the binding affinities of d[Cha(4)]AVP and SSR149415 at recombinant human vasopressin V(1b) (hV(1b)) and oxytocin (hOT) receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and functional properties of both compounds at hV(1b), hV(1a), hV(2) and hOT receptors. 2 d[Cha(4)]AVP bound to hV(1b) receptors and hOT receptors with pK(i) values of 9.68+/-0.06 and 7.68+/-0.09, respectively. SSR149415 showed pK(i) values of 9.34+/-0.06 at hV(1b) and 8.82+/-0.16 at hOT receptors. 3 d[Cha(4)]AVP stimulated [Ca(2+)](i) increase in hV(1b)-CHO cells with a pEC(50) value of 10.05+/-0.15. It showed pEC(50) values of 6.53+/-0.17 and 5.92+/-0.02 at hV(1a) and hV(2) receptors, respectively, and behaved as a weak antagonist at hOT receptors (pK(B)=6.31+/-0.12). SSR149415 inhibited the agonist-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase with pK(B) values of 9.19+/-0.07 in hV(1b)-CHO and 8.72+/-0.15 in hOT-CHO cells. A functional pK(i) value of 7.23+/-0.10 was found for SSR1494151 at hV(1a) receptors, whereas it did not inhibit 20 nM AVP response at hV(2) receptors up to 3 microM. 4 Data obtained confirmed the high potency and selectivity of d[Cha(4)]AVP at hV(1b) receptors, but revealed that SSR149415, in addition to the high potency at hV(1b) receptors, displays a significant antagonism at hOT receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of the human oxytocin receptor stably expressed in 293 human embryonic kidney cells.</h2>
                    <h3>Life sciences; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The human oxytocin (OT) receptor was stably expressed in 293 embryonic kidney cells (293/OTR), characterized pharmacologically and compared to human uterine myometrial receptors. The cloned receptor is expressed at a reasonably high density (0.82 fmole/microgram protein) and exhibits high affinity for [3H]OT (Kd = 0.32nM), similar to the value found in human myometrial tissue. The rank-order of potency for various antagonist and agonist ligands from several structural classes is also similar between the cloned and native receptor, as seen in a comparison of their inhibitory constants for [3H]OT binding. Agonist affinity at the cloned OT receptor is decreased by guanine nucleotide analogs, demonstrating functional G-protein-coupling. The OT receptor in 293 cells, like in human myometrium, is also coupled to the inositol phosphate pathway. In 293/OTR cells, OT stimulates inositol phosphate accumulation with an EC50 = 4.1 nM, an effect blocked by a potent and selective OT antagonist, L-366,948. Additionally, the cloned receptor in 293 cells desensitizes to high concentrations of OT, similar to the desensitization in myometrial tissue and also described for several other G-protein-coupled receptors. These results illustrate the utility of the 293 cell line for expressing human OT receptors in an environment quite comparable to the native myometrial tissue.</p>

                    <p>We investigated the mechanisms that regulate the efficacy of agonists in the arginine-vasopressin (AVP)/oxytocin (OT) receptor system. In this paper, we present evidence that AVP, a full agonist of the vasopressin receptors, acts as a partial agonist on the oxytocin receptor. We also found that AVP becomes a full agonist when two aromatic residues of the oxytocin receptor are replaced by the residues present at equivalent positions in the vasopressin receptor subtypes. Our results indicate that these two residues modulate the response of the oxytocin receptor to the partial agonist AVP.</p>

                    <h2>Histamine- and stress-induced prolactin secretion: importance of vasopressin V1- and V2-receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of endocrinology; 1994</h3>
                    <p>We investigated the involvement of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V1- and V2-receptors in the prolactin (PRL) secretory response to histamine (HA) or restraint stress stimulation in conscious male rats by selective blockade of AVP receptors using different antagonists. Histamine (270 nmol) administered intracerebroventricularly or 5 min of restraint stress stimulated PRL secretion 10-14-fold. Pretreatment with the selective V1-receptor antagonists [1-(p-t-butyl-beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid)-2-(O-methyl)tyrosine-8-D-arginine]vasopressin or [1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid)-2-(O-methyl)tyrosine-8-arginine]vassopressin inhibited the PRL response to HA and restraint stress in a dose-dependent manner with maximal inhibition of 60%. The effect of the two antagonists was identical when equipotent antivasopressor doses were administered. The selective V2-receptor antagonist [1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid)-2-D-isoleucine-4-isoleucine-8-arginine]vasopressin was unable to inhibit the PRL response significantly. Combined administration of the V1-receptor antagonist [1-(p-t-butyl-beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid-2-(O-methyl)tyrosine-8-D-arginine]vasopressin and the V2-receptor antagonist inhibited the PRL response to HA to the same extent as that observed when the V1-antagonist was administered alone. None of the antagonists used had any effect on basal PRL secretion. We conclude that AVP seems to play a role in the mediation of HA- and restraint stress-induced secretion of PRL, and that the AVP receptor involved is primarily of the V1-type or similar to this.</p>
