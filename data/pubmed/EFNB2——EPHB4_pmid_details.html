                    <h3>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Htk is a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase that is related to the EPH subfamily of tyrosine kinases. The receptor has a wide tissue distribution including expression in several myeloid hematopoietic cell lines. Using an Htk-Fc fusion protein, a protein ligand for this receptor was expression cloned from the murine kidney mesangial cell line SV40MES 13. The Htk ligand cDNA encodes a transmembrane protein of 336 amino acids. Binding competition experiments demonstrated a Kd of 535 pM for binding of Htk-Fc to the Htk ligand. Incubation of 3T3 cells expressing Htk with COS-7 cells expressing the ligand resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of Htk. The ligand, like its receptor, is widely expressed and may function in a variety of tissues. However, we localized hematopoietic expression of Htk to the monocytic lineage, suggesting that the ligand may play a role in differentiation and/or proliferation of these cells.</p>

                    <h2>A role of EphB4 receptor and its ligand, ephrin-B2, in erythropoiesis.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical and biophysical research communications; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Erythropoiesis is regulated not only by erythropoietin but also by microenvironments which are composed of transmembrane molecules. We have previously shown that a receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4 is predominantly expressed on human erythroid progenitors in bone marrow. EphB4 is expressed in approximately 45% of hematopoietic progenitor cells, which are CD34-positive and c-Kit-positive in human umbilical cord blood (hUCB). The transmembrane ligand for EphB4 or ephrin-B2 is expressed on bone marrow stromal cells and arterial endothelial cells. When such EphB4-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells were co-cultured with stromal cells which express ephrin-B2, they were immediately detached from stromal cells and differentiated to mature erythroid cells. At that time, expression of EphB4 immediately down-regulated. In contrast, on ephrin-B2 non-expressing stromal cells, they remained EphB4-positive cells and the generated number of mature erythroid cells was less than that on ephrin-B2 expressing stromal cells. Additionally, ephrin-B2 expression on endothelial cells up-regulated under hypoxic condition. Taken together, we propose that one of the molecular cues that regulate erythropoiesis is ephrin-B2 on stromal cells.</p>

                    <h2>Cell-type specific and estrogen dependent expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4 and its ligand ephrin-B2 during mammary gland morphogenesis.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of cell science; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Morphogenesis of the mammary gland occurs mainly during adult life and is dependent on a complex interplay of hormonal, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The molecular mechanisms involved in pattern formation of the mammary epithelium in adult life are poorly understood. Recently, several members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands have been shown to participate in pattern formation during embryogenesis and conceivably may fulfill similar functions during adult morphogenesis. We have investigated the expression of a member of this family, EphB4, and its cognate ligand, ephrin-B2, during normal and malignant mouse mammary morphogenesis. A spatially, temporarily and hormonally coordinated expression of both the receptor and ligand was observed. The receptor was predominantly localized in the myoepithelial cells surrounding the ducts and alveoli whereas ligand expression was limited to the luminal epithelial cells. Expression of both was induced at the onset of gland morphogenesis at puberty and was differentially regulated during the estrus cycle. Ovariectomy of pre-pubertal or adult females abolished the expression of both receptor and ligand and administration of estrogen alone was sufficient to restore their normal expression. Disruption of the balanced expression was observed during experimental mouse mammary carcinogenesis. Ligand expression was lost at the onset of tumorigenesis and receptor expression shifted from myoepithelial to epithelial cells with progressive malignancy. These results implicate both the EphB4 receptor and its ligand ephrin-B2 in the hormone dependent morphogenesis of the mammary gland. Furthermore, their deregulated expression may contribute to mammary carcinogenesis.</p>
