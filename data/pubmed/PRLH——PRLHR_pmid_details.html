                    <h2>Characterization of the binding of [(125)I]-human prolactin releasing peptide (PrRP) to GPR10, a novel G protein coupled receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2000</h3>
                    <p>GPR10 is a novel G-protein coupled receptor that is the human orthologue of rat Unknown Hypothalamic Receptor-1 (UHR-1). Human prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) has been identified as an endogenous ligand for GPR10, and occurs as 31 and 20 amino acid forms. The present study characterizes the binding of [(125)I]-PrRP-20 to HEK293 cells stably expressing GPR10 receptors. Specific binding of [(125)I]-PrRP-20 was saturable, and analysis suggested evidence of both high and low affinity sites, with K:(D:) values of 0.026+/-0.006 and 0.57+/-0.14 nM respectively, and B(max) values of 3010+/-400 and 8570+/-2240 fmol mg protein(-1) respectively. Kinetic studies were unable to distinguish two sites, but single site analysis of association and dissociation data produced a K:(D:) of 0.012 nM. Competition studies revealed that human and rat PrRP-20 and PrRP-31 all display high affinity for GPR10. A range of other drugs which are known ligands at receptors which share limited homology with GPR10 were also tested. None of the drugs tested, including the RF-amide neuropeptide FF, demonstrated any affinity for GPR10. Human PrRP-20 failed to alter basal or forskolin-stimulated levels of intracellular cyclic AMP in HEK293-GPR10 cells, suggesting that GPR10 does not couple via either G(s) or G(i). Functional studies using measurements of intracellular calcium confirmed that human and rat PrRP-20 and PrRP-31 are all potent, full agonists at the GPR10 receptor. The response was blocked both by thapsigargin, indicating mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) stores. These studies indicate that [(125)I]-PrRP-20 is a specific, high affinity radioligand for GPR10. The availability of this radioligand binding assay will be a valuable tool for the investigation of the key features involved in PrRP binding and studies on the localization and function of GPR10.</p>

                    <h2>Prolactin releasing peptide has high affinity and efficacy at neuropeptide FF2 receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) and prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) are two members of the RFamide peptide family. In this study we investigated whether these RFamide peptides, which have common structural features in their C-terminal RFamide motif and share several physiologically important functions, could exert their effects through the same set of receptors. The affinity and functional activity of several related RFamide peptides were determined at the human neuropeptide FF receptor subtype 2 (hNPFF2) and the human prolactin-releasing peptide (hPrRP) receptors. The full-length human prolactin releasing peptide 31 (hPrRP31) had significantly higher efficacy compared with NPFF and its stable analog, (1DMe)Y8Fa, at the hNPFF2 receptor. In contrast, NPFF and (1DMe)Y8Fa were not efficacious at the hPrRP receptor. Our study indicated a generally relatively low level of discrimination for RFamide peptides at the NPFF receptor, whereas the hPrRP receptor clearly preferred PrRP or very closely related peptides. The seemingly promiscuous binding of the RFamide peptides to the NPFF receptor was further confirmed by receptor autoradiography. PrRP may thus signal through the NPFF receptors in vivo.</p>

                    <h2>A prolactin-releasing peptide in the brain.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Hypothalamic peptide hormones regulate the secretion of most of the anterior pituitary hormones, that is, growth hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropin. These peptides do not regulate the secretion of prolactin, at least in a specific manner, however. The peptides act through specific receptors, which are referred to as seven-transmembrane-domain receptors or G-protein-coupled receptors. Although prolactin is important in pregnancy and lactation in mammals, and is involved in the development of the mammary glands and the promotion of milk synthesis, a specific prolactin-releasing hormone has remained unknown. Here we identify a potent candidate for such a hormone. We first proposed that there may still be unknown peptide hormone factors that control pituitary function through seven-transmembrane-domain receptors. We isolated the complementary DNA encoding an 'orphan' receptor (that is, one for which the ligand is unknown). This receptor, hGR3, is specifically expressed in the human pituitary. We then searched for the hGR3 ligand in the hypothalamus and identified a new peptide, which shares no sequence similarity with known peptides and proteins, as an endogenous ligand. We show that this ligand is a potent prolactin-releasing factor for rat anterior pituitary cells; we have therefore named this peptide prolactin-releasing peptide.</p>

                    <h2>The quest for novel bioactive peptides utilizing orphan seven-transmembrane-domain receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany); 1999</h3>
                    <p>Various sorts of bioactive molecules including hormones, neurotransmitters, and chemokines transmit signals into cells by binding to so-called seven-transmembrane-domain receptors (7TMRs). The recent progress in cDNA and genome DNA analyses has brought the discovery of numerous genes encoding ligand-unknown "orphan" 7TMRs. We have developed a strategy to identify the ligands of orphan 7TMRs by monitoring specific signal transductions induced in cells expressing orphan 7TMRs. Employing this method, we succeeded in identifying the natural ligands of the orphan 7TMRs, hGR3, and APJ. The ligand peptide identified for hGR3 was found to show a specific prolactin release promoting activity in rat anterior pituitary cells in in vitro culture and was therefore named "prolactin-releasing peptide." We named another novel bioactive peptide "apelin," for "APJ endogenous ligand." Although the biological functions of apelin are still under investigation, APJ reportedly acts as a coreceptor in the process of human immunodeficiency virus infection. We believe that the identification of orphan 7TMR ligands will provide clues to reveal the unknown regulatory mechanisms of various physiological phenomena and opportunities for novel drug discovery in the future.</p>
