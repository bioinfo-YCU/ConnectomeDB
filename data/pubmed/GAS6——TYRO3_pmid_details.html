                    <h2>The anticoagulation factor protein S and its relative, Gas6, are ligands for the Tyro 3/Axl family of receptor tyrosine kinases.</h2>
                    <h3>Cell; 1995</h3>
                    <p>We report the identification of ligands for Tyro 3 (alternatively called Sky, rse, brt, or tif) and Axl (alternatively, Ark or UFO), members of a previously orphan family of receptor-like tyrosine kinases. These ligands correspond to protein S, a protease regulator that is a potent anticoagulant, and Gas6, a protein related to protein S but lacking any known function. Our results are reminiscent of recent findings that the procoagulant thrombin, a protease that drives clot formation by cleaving fibrinogen to form fibrin, also binds and activates intracellular signaling via a G protein-coupled cell surface receptor. Proteases and protease regulators that also activate specific cell surface receptors may serve to integrate coagulation with associated cellular responses required for tissue repair and growth, as well as to coordinate protease cascades and associated cellular responses in other systems, such as those involved in growth and remodeling of the nervous system.</p>

                    <h2>Identification of the product of growth arrest-specific gene 6 as a common ligand for Axl, Sky, and Mer receptor tyrosine kinases.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Axl, Sky, and Mer, members of an Axl/Sky receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily, are typified by the cell adhesion molecule-related extracellular domain. The product of growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6), structurally homologous to the anticoagulant protein S, was recently identified as the ligand for Axl and Sky, but the ligand for Mer remained unknown. We have now obtained evidence that Gas6 can also function as a ligand for Mer. Co-precipitation analysis, using soluble receptors of Axl, Sky, and Mer (Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc) composed of the extracellular domain of receptors fused to the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G1, clearly showed that Gas6, but not protein S, specifically bound to Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc fusion proteins. Quantitative kinetic analyses using a BIAcore biosensor instrument revealed dissociation constants (Kd) of the binding of rat Gas6 to Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc are 0.4, 2.7, and 29 nM, respectively. We also found that Gas6 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Axl, Sky, and Mer receptors ectopically expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that Gas6 is a common ligand for Axl, Sky, and Mer, all known members of an Axl/Sky receptor subfamily.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of Gas6, a member of the superfamily of G domain-containing proteins, as a ligand for Rse and Axl.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Rse, Ax1, and c-Mer comprise a family of cell adhesion molecule-related tyrosine kinase receptors. Human Gas6 was recently shown to act as a ligand for both human Rse (Godowski et al., 1995) and human Ax1 (Varnum et al., 1995). Gas6 contains an NH2-terminal Gla domain followed by four epidermal growth factor-like repeats and tandem globular (G) domains. The G domains are related to those found in sex hormone-binding globulin and to those utilized by laminin and agrin for binding to the dystroglycan complex. A series of Gas6 variants were tested for their ability to bind to Rse and Ax1. The Gla domain and epidermal growth factor-like repeats were not required for receptor binding, as deletion variants of Gas6 which lacked these domains bound to the extracellular domains of both Rse and Axl. A deletion variant of Gas6 containing just the G domain region was shown to activate Rse phosphorylation. These results provide evidence that G domains can act as signaling molecules by activating transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, they provide a structural link between the activation of cell adhesion related receptors and the control of cell growth and differentiation by the G domain-containing superfamily of proteins.</p>
