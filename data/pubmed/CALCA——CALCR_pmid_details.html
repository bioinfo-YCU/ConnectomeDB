                    <h2>Pharmacological discrimination of calcitonin receptor: receptor activity-modifying protein complexes.</h2>
                    <h3>Molecular pharmacology; 2005</h3>
                    <p>Calcitonin (CT) receptors dimerize with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) to create high-affinity amylin (AMY) receptors, but there is no reliable means of pharmacologically distinguishing these receptors. We used agonists and antagonists to define their pharmacology, expressing the CT(a) receptor alone or with RAMPs in COS-7 cells and measuring cAMP accumulation. Intermedin short, otherwise known as adrenomedullin 2, mirrored the action of alpha CGRP, being a weak agonist at CT(a), AMY(2a), and AMY(3a) receptors but considerably more potent at AMY(1a) receptors. Likewise, the linear calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) analogs (Cys(ACM)(2,7))h alpha CGRP and (Cys(Et)(2,7))h alpha CGRP were only effective at AMY(1a) receptors, but they were partial agonists. As previously observed in COS-7 cells, there was little induction of the AMY(2a) receptor phenotype; thus, AMY(2a) was not examined further in this study. The antagonist peptide salmon calcitonin(8-32) (sCT(8-32)) did not discriminate strongly between CT and AMY receptors; however, AC187 was a more effective antagonist of AMY responses at AMY receptors, and AC413 additionally showed modest selectivity for AMY(1a) over AMY(3a) receptors. CGRP(8-37) also demonstrated receptor-dependent effects. CGRP(8-37) more effectively antagonized AMY at AMY(1a) than AMY(3a) receptors, although it was only a weak antagonist of both, but it did not inhibit responses at the CT(a) receptor. Low CGRP(8-37) affinity and agonism by linear CGRP analogs at AMY(1a) are the classic signature of a CGRP2 receptor. Our data indicate that careful use of combinations of agonists and antagonists may allow pharmacological discrimination of CT(a), AMY(1a), and AMY(3a) receptors, providing a means to delineate the physiological significance of these receptors.</p>

                    <h3>The Biochemical journal; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) with single transmembrane domains define the function of two G-protein-coupled receptors of the B family. Cell-surface complexes of human RAMP1 (hRAMP1) and human calcitonin (CT) receptor isotype 2 (hCTR2) or rat CT-receptor-like receptor (rCRLR) have now been identified through protein cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. They are two distinct CT-gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors coupled to cAMP production and pharmacologically distinguished by the CT and CGRP antagonists salmon CT(8-32) and human or rat CGRP(8-37). Thus direct molecular interactions of hRAMP1 with hCTR2 or rCRLR are required for CGRP recognition. hCTR2, moreover, adopts non-traditional functions through its association with hRAMP1.</p>

                    <h2>Coexistence of novel amylin-binding sites with calcitonin receptors in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of endocrinology; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Amylin, calcitonin (CT) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) share limited structural homology including amino-terminal ring structures linked by a disulfide bridge and amidated carboxy-termini. Here, we have compared [125I]Bolton-Hunter-[Lys1] rat amylin ([125I]amylin) binding and the stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation by human (h) amylin, hCT and hCGRP-I in the human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and T47D, which predominantly express hCT1a and hCT1b receptor isoforms (hCTR1a, hCTR1b) at a similar total number of hCT-binding sites. In MCF-7 cells, half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of [125I]amylin binding by human amylin was observed at 3.6 +/- 0.8 nM (n = 6). hCT and hCGRP-I displaced [125I]amylin binding with 22 and 66 times higher IC50. [125I]hCT binding was inhibited by hCT with an IC50 of 8.1 +/- 1.9 nM (n = 5), and human amylin and hCGRP-I were over 100 times less potent. In T47D cells, on the other hand, specific binding of [125I]amylin was not observed, but hCT inhibited [125I]hCT binding with an IC50 of 3.2 +/- 0.4 nM (n = 3), and human amylin and hCGRP-I had over 200 times higher IC50. In MCF-7 cells, half-maximal stimulation (EC50) of cyclic AMP accumulation by human amylin, hCT and hCGRP-I occurred at 1.4 +/- 0.2, 1.7 +/- 0.4 and 6.3 +/- 1.3 nM respectively. In T47D cells, the EC50 of hCT was 0.32 +/- 0.02 nM (n = 3), and 30- and 1900-fold higher with human amylin and hCGRP-I. In conclusion, the expression of hCTR1a and hCTR1b and [125I]hCT binding were indistinguishable in MCF-7 and T47D cells. Yet, [125I]amylin binding was only recognized in MCF-7 cells, consistent with a distinct amylin receptor.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of the human calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor subtypes associated with receptor activity-modifying proteins.</h2>
                    <h3>Molecular pharmacology; 2004</h3>
                    <p>Coexpression of receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) with calcitonin receptor 2 (CTR2) or calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) leads to the formation of four functional heterodimeric receptors for human calcitonin gene-related peptide (hCGRP). In this study, we transfected hCGRP receptors into human embryonic kidney 293 cells and examined their pharmacological profiles using three dominant-negative (DN) RAMP mutants and various hCGRPalpha analogs. Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis revealed that their cotransfection with CTR2 induced cell surface expression of all three RAMPs, and the three CTR2/RAMP heterodimers mediated equivalent levels of cAMP production in response to hCGRPalpha that were approximately 50-fold greater than were seen with CTR2 alone. By contrast, [Tyr0]hCGRPalpha binding and signaling were markedly weaker with CTR2/RAMP2 or -3 than with CTR2/RAMP1 or CRLR/RAMP1; likewise, 125I-[His10]hCGRPalpha bound most potently to CTR2/RAMP1. When CTR2 was coexpressed with DN RAMP1 or -2, hCGRPalpha-evoked responses were similar to those seen with CTR2 alone, despite the expression of both CTR2 and DN RAMP at the cell surface. But coexpression of DN RAMP3 with CTR2 significantly diminished hCGRPalpha signaling compared with that seen with CTR2 alone, indicating that DN RAMP3 is able to function as a negative regulator of CTR2 function. Competition experiments showed the relative agonist sensitivity of the four receptors to be hCGRPalpha > [Tyr0]hCGRPalpha > [Cys(Et)2,7]hCGRPalpha > [Cys(ACM)2,7]hCGRPalpha. Of the linear analogs, [Cys(ACM)2,7]hCGRPalpha (ACM, acetylmethoxy) enhanced cAMP formation only via CTR2/RAMP1, whereas [Cys(Et2,7)]hCGRPalpha acted via CRLR/RAMP1 and somewhat less potently via CTR2/RAMP1. Thus, among the three CGRP8-37-insensitive receptors, CTR2/RAMP1 is most sensitive to the two linear analogs, suggesting that it could be classified as a CGRP2 receptor. Moreover, the combined use of iodinated CGRPalpha analogs may be useful for defining the CGRP1 receptor.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular cloning and functional expression of a third isoform of the human calcitonin receptor and partial characterization of the calcitonin receptor gene.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrinology; 1995</h3>
                    <p>We have cloned and expressed two isoforms of the human calcitonin (hCT) receptor. Primers designed from the published sequence of a CT receptor cloned from an ovarian small cell carcinoma line were used for the polymerase chain reaction amplification of related products from human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. Two complementary DNAs were isolated. One clone lacks a 16-amino acid insert in the first intracellular loop and is virtually identical to the receptor recently cloned from the T47D human breast carcinoma cell line. The second clone is another splice variant lacking both the 16-amino acid insert in the first intracellular domain as well as the first 47 amino acids of the amino-terminus extracellular domain. COS-7 cells transfected with either receptor isoform bound [125I]salmon CT with high affinity and responded to hCT with increases in cAMP. Tissue distribution studies revealed the truncated extracellular domain 1 isoform transcripts in human skeletal muscle, kidney, brain, and lung. Analysis of a hCT receptor genomic clone demonstrated an exon/intron organization similar to that of the porcine CT receptor gene, except for a distinct exon coding for the alternatively spliced insert in the first intracellular domain.</p>

                    <h2>Novel calcitonin-(8-32)-sensitive adrenomedullin receptors derived from co-expression of calcitonin receptor with receptor activity-modifying proteins.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical and biophysical research communications; 2003</h3>
                    <p>We tested whether heterodimers comprised of calcitonin (CT) receptor lacking the 16-amino acid insert in intracellular domain 1 (CTR(I1-)) and receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) can function not only as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors but also as adrenomedullin (AM) receptors. Whether transfected alone or together with RAMP, human (h)CTR(I1-) appeared mainly at the surface of HEK-293 cells. Expression of CTR(I1-) alone led to significant increases in cAMP in response to hCGRP or hAM, though both peptides remained about 100-fold less potent than hCT. However, the apparent potency of AM, like that of CGRP, approached that of CT when CTR(I1-) was co-expressed with RAMP. CGRP- or AM-evoked cAMP production was strongly inhibited by salmon CT-(8-32), a selective amylin receptor antagonist, but not by hCGRP-(8-37) or hAM-(22-52), antagonists of CGRP and AM receptors, respectively. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of CT-(8-32) were much stronger in cells co-expressing CTR(I1-) and RAMP than in cells expressing CTR(I1-) alone. Co-expression of CTR(I1-) with RAMP thus appears to produce functional CT-(8-32)-sensitive AM receptors.</p>

                    <h2>An amylin receptor is revealed following co-transfection of a calcitonin receptor with receptor activity modifying proteins-1 or -3.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrinology; 1999</h3>
                    <p>Human receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMP) regulate the ligand specificity of the calcitonin-receptor-like-receptor (McLatchie et al., Nature 393:333-339 (1998)). Here we have investigated binding of [125I]-labeled human (h) calcitonin ([125I]hCT) and rat amylin ([125I]amylin) to rabbit aortic endothelial cells (RAEC) co-transfected with the hCT receptor isotype 2 (hCTR2) and RAMP1, -2 or -3. Specific binding of 125 pM [125I]hCT to cells transfected with hCTR2 alone was 6.7 +/- 0.7 fmol/50,000 cells (n=5), and was reduced by 45 +/- 2% and 86 +/- 3% (P < 0.001) in the presence of RAMP1 and -3, but remained unchanged with RAMP2. In the absence and presence of individual RAMPs [125I]hCT binding inhibition occured with similar IC50 of between 6 nM and 11 nM hCT, and human amylin was 24- to 54-fold less potent. Specific binding of 125 pM [125I]amylin to cells transfected with hCTR2 alone was 0.9 +/- 0.2 fmol/50,000 cells (n=6), and was increased by 262 +/- 48% (P < 0.005), 73 +/- 26% (P < 0.05) and 338 +/- 57% (P < 0.005) with RAMP1, -2 or -3, respectively. [125I]amylin binding was inhibited with IC50 of 3.1 +/- 0.5 nM and 4.0 +/- 0.8 nM human amylin in cells co-transfected with RAMP1 or -3, respectively, and hCT was 45 +/- 2- and 126 +/- 3-fold less potent. In conclusion, RAMP1 and -3 decrease calcitonin receptor expression in RAEC transfected with hCTR2 encoding cDNA and simultanously reveal an amylin receptor.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological characterization of receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) and the human calcitonin receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods; 1999</h3>
                    <p>Receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) are a family of single transmembrane domain proteins shown to be important for the transport and ligand specificity of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor. In this report, we describe the analysis of pharmacological properties of the human calcitonin receptor (hCTR) coexpressed with different RAMPs with the use of the Xenopus laevis melanophore expression system. We show that coexpression of RAMP3 with human calcitonin receptor changed the relative potency of hCTR to human calcitonin (hCAL) and rat amylin. RAMP1 and RAMP2, in contrast, had little effect on the change of hCTR potency to hCAL or rat amylin. When coexpressed with RAMP3, hCTR reversed the relative potency by a 3.5-fold loss in sensitivity to hCAL and a 19-fold increase in sensitivity to rat amylin. AC66, an inverse agonist, produced apparent simple competitive antagonism of hCAL and rat amylin, as indicated by linear Schild regressions. The potency of AC66 was changed in the blockade of rat amylin but not hCAL responses with RAMP3 coexpression. The mean pK(B) for AC66 to hCAL was 9.4 +/- 0.3 without RAMP3 and 9.45 +/- 0.07 with RAMP3. For the antagonism of AC66 to rat amylin, the pK(B) was 9.25 +/- 0.15 without RAMP3 and 8.2 +/- 0.35 with RAMP3. The finding suggests that RAMP3 might modify the active states of calcitonin receptor in such a way as to create a new receptor phenotype that is "amylin-like." Irrespective of the physiological association of the new receptor species, the finding that a coexpressed membrane protein can completely change agonist and antagonist affinities for a receptor raises implications for screening in recombinant receptor systems.</p>
