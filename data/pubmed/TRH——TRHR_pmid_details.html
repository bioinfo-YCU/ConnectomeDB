                    <h2>Expression cloning of a cDNA encoding the mouse pituitary thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; 1990</h3>
                    <p>Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is an important extracellular regulatory molecule that functions as a releasing factor in the anterior pituitary gland and as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Binding sites for TRH are present in these tissues, but the TRH receptor (TRH-R) has not been purified from any source. Using Xenopus laevis oocytes in an expression cloning strategy, we have isolated a cDNA clone that encodes the mouse pituitary TRH-R. This conclusion is based on the following evidence. Injection of sense RNA transcribed in vitro from this cDNA into Xenopus oocytes leads to expression of cell-surface receptors that bind TRH and the competitive antagonist chlordiazepoxide with appropriate affinities and that elicit electrophysiological responses to TRH with the appropriate concentration dependency. Antisense RNA inhibits the TRH response in Xenopus oocytes injected with RNA isolated from normal rat anterior pituitary glands. Finally, transfection of COS-1 cells with this cDNA leads to expression of receptors that bind TRH and chlordiazepoxide with appropriate affinities and that transduce TRH stimulation of inositol phosphate formation. The 3.8-kilobase mouse TRH-R cDNA encodes a protein of 393 amino acids that shows similarities to other guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein-coupled receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Fate of internalized thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptors monitored with a timer fusion protein.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrinology; 2004</h3>
                    <p>Trafficking of TRH receptors was studied in a stable HEK293 cell line expressing receptor fused to a Timer protein (TRHR-Timer) that spontaneously changes from green to red over 10 h. Cells expressing TRHR-Timer responded to TRH with an 11-fold increase in inositol phosphate formation, increased intracellular free calcium, and internalization of 75% of bound [(3)H][N(3)-methyl-His(2)]TRH within 10 min. After a 20-min exposure to TRH at 37 C, 75-80% of surface binding sites disappeared as receptors internalized. When TRH was removed and cells incubated in hormone-free medium, approximately 75% of [(3)H][N(3)-methyl-His(2)]TRH binding sites reappeared at the surface over the next 2 h with or without cycloheximide. Trafficking of TRHR-Timer was monitored microscopically after addition and withdrawal of TRH. In untreated cells, both new (green) and old (red) receptors were seen at the plasma membrane, and TRH caused rapid movement of young and old receptors into cytoplasmic vesicles. When TRH was withdrawn, some TRHR-Timer reappeared at the plasma membrane after several hours, but much of the internalized receptor remained intracellular in vesicles that condensed to larger structures in perinuclear regions deeper within the cell. Strikingly, receptors that moved to the plasma membrane were generally younger (more green) than those that underwent endocytosis. There was no change in the red to green ratio over the course of the experiment in cells exposed to vehicle. The results indicate that, after agonist-driven receptor internalization, the plasma membrane is replenished with younger receptors, arising either from an intracellular pool or preferential recycling of younger receptors.</p>

                    <h2>The thyrotropin-releasing hormone-receptor complex and G11alpha are both internalised into clathrin-coated vesicles.</h2>
                    <h3>Cellular signalling; 1998</h3>
                    <p>It has been proposed that, after agonist binding, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) becomes internalised associated with Gq, as part of a TRH-TRHR-Gq ternary complex [13]. We tested this hypothesis directly by examining the intracellular distribution of the TRHR and Gq/11 after agonist binding. The localisation of the TRH-TRHR complex and Gq/11alpha was studied by the biochemical isolation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). The internalised TRH-TRHR complex was localised in CCVs. The CCVs, which had internalised [3H]MeTRH, contained 4-fold higher levels of radiolabelled ligand than did CCVs from cells incubated with [3H]MeTRH at 4 degrees C. Like the receptor-ligand (RL) complex, G11alpha also translocated to these endocytic vesicles. For example, CCVs from cells with internalised TRH-TRHR complexes contained G11alpha, whereas CCVs from cells without internalised RL complexes lacked G11alpha. We conclude that, after agonist-induced TRHR-G11alpha coupling, both the TRH-TRHR complex and G11alpha are internalised in CCVs.</p>
