                    <h3>Nature; 1992</h3>
                    <p>The neurohypophyseal hormone arginine vasopressin has diverse actions, including the inhibition of diuresis, contraction of smooth muscle, stimulation of liver glycogenolysis and modulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone release from the pituitary. Arginine vasopressin receptors are G protein-coupled and have been divided into at least three types; the V1a (vascular/hepatic) and V1b (anterior pituitary) receptors which act through phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis to mobilize intracellular Ca2+, and the V2 (kidney) receptor which is coupled to adenylate cyclase. We report here the cloning of a complementary DNA encoding the hepatic V1a arginine vasopressin receptor. The liver cDNA encodes a protein with seven putative transmembrane domains, which binds arginine vasopressin and related compounds with affinities similar to the native rat V1a receptor. The messenger RNA corresponding to the cDNA is distributed in rat tissues known to contain V1a receptors.</p>

                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1994</h3>
                    <p>Vasopressin (AVP), the antidiuretic hormone, is a cyclic nonapeptide that acts through binding to G protein-coupled specific membrane receptors pharmacologically divided into three subtypes (V1a, V1b, and V2) linked to distinct second messengers. Within the family of human AVP receptors, the V2 AVP receptor has been cloned, but the structure of the human V1a and V1b AVP receptors remains unknown. We report here the structure and functional expression of a human V1a AVP receptor complementary DNA isolated from human liver cDNA libraries. Cloning and sequencing of a full-length clone isolated a 1472-nucleotide sequence encoding a 418-amino acid polypeptide with seven putative transmembrane domains typical of G protein-coupled receptors. Amino acid sequence identity with the rat liver V1a AVP receptor, the human and rat V2 AVP receptors, and the human oxytocin receptor was 72, 36, 37, and 45%, respectively. Functional characterization of the cloned receptor was done by transient expression in COS-7 cells and stable expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Localization of the expressed receptor at the cellular surface was illustrated by using the fluorescent linear analog phenylacetyl-D-Tyr(Et)-Phe-Gln-Asn-Lys-Pro-Arg-NH2 coupled to fluorescein-avidin by dodecabiotin. Competition binding experiments with phenylacetyl-D-Tyr(Et)-Phe-Val-Asn-Lys-Pro-[125I]Tyr-NH2 and AVP analogs revealed high affinity specific binding sites of the V1a subtype. Saturation binding experiments with [3H]AVP confirmed the presence of a single class of high affinity binding sites. Measurement of AVP-induced inositol phosphate production and calcium mobilization confirmed that the expressed V1a AVP receptor is coupled to phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. Thus, the human V1a AVP receptor belongs to the superfamily of seven-transmembrane segment receptors with a significant sequence identity with the other members of the AVP-oxytocin family of receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological characterization of the human vasopressin receptor subtypes stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Three subtypes of human (h) arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptors, hV1A, hV1B and hV2, were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and characterized by [3H]-AVP binding studies. In addition, the coupling of the expressed receptor protein to a variety of signal transduction pathways was investigated. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms for the specific binding of [3H]-AVP to membranes, prepared from CHO cells transfected with hV1A, hV1B and hV2 receptors, yielded an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.39, 0.25 and 1.21 nM and a maximum receptor density (Bmax) of 1580 fmol mg(-1) protein, 5230 fmol mg(-1) protein and 7020 fmol mg(-1) protein, respectively. Hill coefficients did not differ significantly from unity, suggesting binding to homogenous, non-interacting receptor populations. Pharmacological characterization of the transfected human AVP receptors was undertaken by measuring the relative ability of nonpeptide AVP receptor antagonists, YM087, OPC-21268, OPC-31260, SR 49059 and SR 121463A, to inhibit binding of [3H]-AVP. At hV1A receptors, the relative order of potency was SR49059>YM087>OPC-31260>SR 121463A> >OPC-21268 and at hV2 receptors, YM087=SR 121463A>OPC-31260>SR 49059> >OPC-21268. In contrast, the relative order of potency, at hV1B receptors, was SR 49059> >SR 121463A=YM087=OPC-31260=OPC-21268. In CHO cells expressing either hV1A or hV1B receptors, AVP caused a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with an EC50 value of 1.13 nM and 0.90 nM, respectively. In contrast, stimulation of CHO cells expressing hV2 receptors resulted in an accumulation of cyclic AMP with an EC50 value of 2.22 nM. The potency order of antagonists in inhibiting AVP-induced [Ca2+]i or cyclic AMP response was similar to that observed in radioligand binding assays. In conclusion, we have characterized the pharmacology of human cloned V1A, V1B and V2 receptors and used these to determine the affinity, selectivity and potency of nonpeptide AVP receptor antagonists. Thus they may prove to be a valuable tool in further examination of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of AVP.</p>

                    <h2>Mapping peptide-binding domains of the human V1a vasopressin receptor with a photoactivatable linear peptide antagonist.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1997</h3>
                    <p>The study of antagonist-binding domains of the human V1a vasopressin receptor was performed using a radioiodinated photoreactive peptide antagonist. This ligand displayed a high affinity for the receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes, and specifically labeled two protein bands with apparent molecular mass at 85-90 and 46 kDa. Our results clearly show that the V1a receptor is degraded during incubation with the ligand and that the 46-kDa species is probably the result of the 85-90-kDa species proteolytic cleavage. Truncation of the receptor was then confirmed by deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F. A monoclonal antibody directed against a c-Myc epitope added at the receptor NH2 terminus allowed immunoprecipitation of the 85-90-kDa photolabeled species. The 46-kDa photolabeled protein never immunoprecipitated, indicating that the truncated form of the receptor lacks the NH2 terminus region. To localize photolabeled domains of the receptor, the 46-kDa protein was cleaved with V8 and/or Lys-C endoproteinases. The identity of the smallest photolabeled fragment, observed at approximately 6 kDa, was then confirmed by mutation of the potential V8 cleavage sites. Our results indicate that covalent labeling of the vasopressin V1a receptor with the photoreactive antagonist occurs in a region including transmembrane domain VII (residues Asn327-Lys370).</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of a novel nonpeptide vasopressin V(2)-agonist, OPC-51803, in cells transfected human vasopressin receptor subtypes.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2000</h3>
                    <p>We discovered the first nonpeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) V(2)-receptor agonist, OPC-51803. Pharmacological properties of OPC-51803 were elucidated using HeLa cells expressing human AVP receptor subtypes (V(2), V(1a) and V(1b)) and compared with those of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP), a peptide V(2)-receptor agonist. OPC-51803 and dDAVP displaced [(3)H]-AVP binding to human V(2)- and V(1a)-receptors with K(i) values of 91.9+/-10.8 nM (n = 6) and 3.12+/-0.38 nM (n = 6) for V(2)-receptors, and 819+/-39 nM (n = 6) and 41.5+/-9.9 nM (n = 6) for V(1a)-receptors, indicating that OPC-51803 was about nine times more selective for V(2)-receptors, similar to the selectivity of dDAVP. OPC-51803 scarcely displaced [(3)H]-AVP binding to human V(1b)-receptors even at 10(-4) M, while dDAVP showed potent affinity to human V(1b)-receptors with the K(i) value of 13.7+/-3.2 nM (n = 4). OPC-51803 concentration-dependently increased cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production in HeLa cells expressing human V(2)-receptors with an EC(50) value of 189+/-14 nM (n = 6). The concentration-response curve for cyclic AMP production induced by OPC-51803 was shifted to the right in the presence of a V(2)-antagonist, OPC-31260. At 10(-5) M, OPC-51803 did not increase the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in HeLa cells expressing human V(1a)-receptors. On the other hand, dDAVP increased [Ca(2+)](i) in HeLa cells expressing human V(1a)- and V(1b)-receptors in a concentration-dependent fashion. From these results, OPC-51803 has been confirmed to be the first nonpeptide agonist for human AVP V(2)-receptors without agonistic activities for V(1a)- and V(1b)-receptors. OPC-51803 may be useful for the treatment of AVP-deficient pathophysiological states and as a tool for AVP researches.</p>

                    <h2>The human V3 pituitary vasopressin receptor: ligand binding profile and density-dependent signaling pathways.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrinology; 1997</h3>
                    <p>The vasopressin (AVP) V3 pituitary receptor (V3R) is a G protein-coupled corticotropic phenotypic marker that is overexpressed in ACTH-hypersecreting tumors. Studies of the agonist/antagonist binding profile and signal transduction pathways linked to the human V3R have been limited because of the scarcity of this protein. To define the signals activated by V3Rs and the eventual changes triggered by developmental or pathological receptor regulation, we developed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-V3 cells stably expressing low, medium, or high levels of human V3Rs (binding capacity, <10, 10-25, and 25-100 pmol/mg, respectively). The affinity of the V3R for 21 peptide and nonpeptide AVP analogs was clearly distinct from that exhibited by the human V1R and V2R. AVP triggered stimulation of phospholipase C in CHO-V3 cells (partially sensitive to treatment with pertussis toxin) with a potency directly proportional to receptor density. V3R-mediated arachidonic acid release also was also sensitive to pertussis toxin and more efficacious in cells exhibiting medium than in those with high receptor density. AVP also stimulated the pertussis toxin-insensitive uptake of [3H]thymidine in CHO-V3 cells. The concentration-response curves for this effect were monophasic in cells expressing low and medium levels of V3Rs; on the contrary, a biphasic curve was observed in cells with high V3R density. Coupling of V3R to increased production of cAMP was only observed in CHOV3 high cells, suggesting a negative relationship between increased cAMP production and DNA synthesis. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by V3R was pertussis toxin insensitive, but was dependent on activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C; both the level and duration of activation were a function of the receptor density. Thus, the human V3R has a pharmacological profile clearly distinct from that of the human V1R and V2R and activates several signaling pathways via different G proteins, depending on the level of receptor expression. The increased synthesis of DNA and cAMP levels observed in cells expressing medium and high levels of V3Rs, respectively, may represent important events in the tumorigenesis of corticotroph cells.</p>

                    <h2>[1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] arginine vasopressin: a potent and specific agonist for vasopressin V1b receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrinology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>To date, there are no vasopressin (VP) agonists that exhibit a high affinity and selectivity for the VP V1b receptor with respect to the V1a, V2, and oxytocin receptors. In this study, we describe the synthesis and pharmacological properties of [1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] arginine vasopressin (d[Cha4]AVP). Binding experiments performed on various membrane preparations revealed that d[Cha(4)]AVP exhibits a nanomolar affinity for V1b receptors from various mammalian species (rat, bovine, human). It exhibits high V1b/V1a and V1b/oxytocin selectivity for rat, human, and bovine receptors. Furthermore, it exhibits high V1b/V2 specificity for both bovine and human vasopressin receptors. Functional studies performed on biological models that naturally express V1b receptors indicate that d[Cha4]AVP is an agonist. Like VP, it stimulated basal and corticotropin-releasing factor-stimulated ACTH secretion and basal catecholamine release from rat anterior pituitary and bovine chromaffin cells, respectively. In vivo experiments performed in rat revealed that d[Cha4]AVP was able to stimulate both ACTH and corticosterone secretion and exhibits negligible vasopressor activity. It retains about 30% of the antidiuretic activity of VP. This long-sought selective VP V1b receptor ligand with nanomolar affinity will allow a better understanding of V1b-mediated VP physiological effects and is a promising new tool for V1b receptor structure-function studies.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological characterization of YM087, a potent, nonpeptide human vasopressin V1A and V2 receptor antagonist.</h2>
                    <h3>Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology; 1998</h3>
                    <p>The effects of YM087 (4'-[(2-methyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydroimidazo[4,5-d] [1]benzazepin-6-yl)-carbonyl]-2-phenylbenzanilide monohydrochloride), a novel nonpeptide vasopressin (AVP) receptor antagonist, on [3H]AVP binding to human AVP receptors (V1A, V1B and V2) cloned and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells generated from monkey renal tissue were studied. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms for the specific binding of [3H]AVP to membranes, prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with human V1A, V1B and V2 receptors, yielded an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.67 nM, 0.28 nM and 2.14 nM and a maximum receptor density (Bmax) of 2180 fmol/mg protein, 369 fmol/mg protein and 2660 fmol/mg protein, respectively. YM087 showed high affinity for AVP V1A and V2 receptors with Ki values of 6.3 and 1.1 nM, respectively, but had no effect on [3H]AVP binding to AVP V1B receptors. In COS-1 cells expressing either AVP V1A or V1B receptors, AVP caused a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). YM087 inhibited the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in COS-1 cells expressing AVP V1A receptors in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 14.3 nM, but did not influence this increase in AVP V1B-receptor expressing cells. In contrast, stimulation of COS-1 cells expressing AVP V2 receptors resulted in an accumulation of cAMP. YM087 inhibited AVP-induced cAMP production in COS-1 cells expressing AVP V2 receptors in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 1.95 nM. In all assays used, YM087 was devoid of any agonistic activity. These results suggest that YM087 is a potent nonpeptide dual human AVP V1A and V2 receptor antagonist, and that YM087 will be a powerful tool in investigation of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of AVP.</p>

                    <h2>Design of potent and selective agonists for the human vasopressin V1b receptor based on modifications of [deamino-cys1]arginine vasopressin at position 4.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of medicinal chemistry; 2004</h3>
                    <p>The glutamine(4) residue in [deamino-Cys(1)]arginine vasopressin (dAVP) was replaced by a broad series of aliphatic, aromatic, polar, and charged amino acids to give the following peptides: d[Gly(4)]AVP (1), d[Ala(4)]AVP (2), d[Abu(4)]AVP (3), d[Nva(4)]AVP (4), d[Nle(4)]AVP (5), d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Ile(4)]AVP (7), d[Thi(4)]AVP (8), d[Phe(4)]AVP (9), d[Tyr(4)]AVP (10), d[Trp(4)]AVP (11), d[Asn(4)]AVP (12), d[Ser(4)]AVP (13), d[Thr(4)]AVP (14), d[Dap(4)]AVP (15), d[Dab(4)]AVP (16), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), d[Har(4)]AVP (20), and d[Glu(4)]AVP (21). All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods using BOC chemistry for all but one peptide (8), which required the use of Fmoc chemistry. The binding and functional properties of these position 4 substituted analogues of dAVP (d[X(4)]AVP) and the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP (Derick et al. Endocrinology 2002, 143, 4655-4664) were evaluated on human arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1a), V(1b), and V(2) receptors and on the human oxytocin (OT) receptor expressed in living Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Binding studies revealed that broad modifications of the fourth residue of dAVP do not significantly alter affinity for the human V(1b) receptor. Only aromatic (Phe, Tyr, Trp) or negatively charged (Glu) residues reduce V(1b) affinity. By contrast, the human V(1a) and more particularly the human V(2) and the OT receptors are more sensitive to many of these modifications. Thus, the replacement of the Gln(4) residue of dAVP by aliphatic (Leu, Cha) or positively charged (Orn, Lys, Arg, Har) amino acids led to analogues exhibiting drastic reductions of their affinity for the human V(1a), V(2), and OT receptors. Consequently, in addition to the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP, peptides 6 and 17-20 display excellent selectivities for the human V(1b) receptor. The key structural requirement responsible for optimal V(1b) selectivity appears to be the length and branching of the aliphatic side chain of the fourth residue of dAVP. Functional studies performed on CHO cells expressing the different human AVP/OT receptors confirm the V(1b) selectivity of peptides 6, 17, 18, 20, and d[Cha(4)]AVP. However, d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), which triggers an excellent coupling between the human V(2) receptor and adenylyl cyclase, was found to exhibit both V(1b) and V(2) agonism in functional tests. More interestingly, these functional experiments revealed that, depending on the AVP/OT receptor, a given d[X(4)]AVP analogue may behave as a full agonist or as a partial agonist. This strongly suggests that the fourth residue of dAVP plays an important role in the coupling between the hormone-receptor complex, the heterotrimeric G protein, and the effectors. In conclusion, the synthesis of these d[X(4)]AVP analogues led to the discovery of new V(1b) agonists with high affinity and greatly enhanced selectivities. Thus, in addition to d[Cha(4)]AVP, d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), and d[Har(4)]AVP (20) are useful new tools for studying the structure and the function of the human V(1b) receptor.</p>

                    <h2>1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) as an agonist on V1b vasopressin receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical pharmacology; 1997</h3>
                    <p>1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) is considered a standard vasopressin V2 receptor-selective agonist with a potent antidiuretic effect through V2 receptor without the induction of vasoconstriction through V1a receptor. Furthermore, DDAVP was reported to act as an agonist on non-V1a, non-V2 receptor to cause the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ in several tissues. However, the agonistic activity of DDAVP against the other vasopressin receptor, V1b (or V3), which can accumulate intracellular Ca2+ and which we recently cloned, has not been clarified. Hence, we compared the characteristics of DDAVP on V1b receptor with those on the other vasopressin receptors. In binding experiments, DDAVP more strongly inhibited [3H]arginine vasopressin binding to V1b than to V2 receptor (Ki: 5.84 nM vs 65.9 nM). In addition, DDAVP dose-dependently stimulated inositol turnover in human V1b receptor-expressing COS-1 cells. DDAVP acted as a full agonist on human V1b receptor (EC50: 11.4 nM) as well as on human V2 receptor (EC50: 23.9 nM). However, DDAVP behaved as a partial agonist toward rat V1b receptor (intrinsic activity: 0.7, EC50: 43.5 nM), while there was no significant difference in the agonistic properties of arginine vasopressin on human and rat V1b receptor. In conclusion, DDAVP acts as an agonist on V1b receptor, as it does on V2 receptor. These findings will allow us to better understand the physiological role of V1b receptor in pancreatic beta cells and in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, and help us to identify as yet unknown vasopressin receptors through which DDAVP cause the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ in other tissues.</p>

                    <h2>Conserved aromatic residues in the transmembrane region VI of the V1a vasopressin receptor differentiate agonist vs. antagonist ligand binding.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of biochemistry; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Despite their opposite effects on signal transduction, the nonapeptide hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and its V1a receptor-selective cyclic peptide antagonist d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP display homologous primary structures, differing only at residues 1 and 2. These structural similarities led us to hypothesize that both ligands could interact with the same binding pocket in the V1a receptor. To determine receptor residues responsible for discriminating binding of agonist and antagonist ligands, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of conserved aromatic and hydrophilic residues as well as nonconserved residues, all located in the transmembrane binding pocket of the V1a receptor. Mutation of aromatic residues of transmembrane region VI (W304, F307, F308) reduced affinity for the d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP and markedly decreased affinity for the unrelated strongly hydrophobic V1a-selective nonpeptide antagonist SR 49059. Replacement of these aromatic residues had no effect on AVP binding, but increased AVP-induced coupling efficacy of the receptor for its G protein. Mutating hydrophilic residues Q108, K128 and Q185 in transmembrane regions II, III and IV, respectively, led to a decrease in affinity for both agonists and antagonists. Finally, the nonconserved residues T333 and A334 in transmembrane region VII, controlled the V1a/V2 binding selectivity for both nonpeptide and cyclic peptide antagonists. Thus, because conserved aromatic residues of the V1a receptor binding pocket seem essential for antagonists and do not contribute at all to the binding of agonists, we propose that these residues differentiate agonist vs. antagonist ligand binding.</p>

                    <h2>OPC-41061, a highly potent human vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist: pharmacological profile and aquaretic effect by single and multiple oral dosing in rats.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 1998</h3>
                    <p>The pharmacological profile and the acute and chronic aquaretic effects of OPC-41061, a novel nonpeptide human arginine vasopressin (AVP) V2-receptor antagonist, were respectively characterized in HeLa cells expressing cloned human AVP receptors and in conscious male rats. OPC-41061 antagonized [3H]-AVP binding to human V2-receptors (Ki = 0.43 +/- 0.06 nM) more potently than AVP (Ki = 0. 78 +/- 0.08 nM) or OPC-31260 (Ki = 9.42 +/- 0.90 nM). OPC-41061 also inhibited [3H]-AVP binding to human V1a-receptors (Ki = 12.3 +/- 0.8 nM) but not to human V1b-receptors, indicating that OPC-41061 was 29 times more selective for V2-receptors than for V1a-receptors. OPC-41061 inhibited cAMP production induced by AVP with no intrinsic agonist activity. In rats, OPC-41061 inhibited [3H]-AVP binding to V1a-receptors (Ki = 325 +/- 41 nM) and V2-receptors (Ki = 1.33 +/- 0. 30 nM), showing higher receptor selectivity (V1a/V2 = 244) than with human receptors. A single oral administration of OPC-41061 in rats clearly produced dose-dependent aquaresis. In treatment by multiple OPC-41061 dosing for 28 days at 1 and 10 mg/kg p.o. in rats, significant aquaretic effects were seen throughout the study period. As the result of aquaresis, hemoconcentration was seen at 4 hr postdosing although, no differences were seen in serum osmolality, sodium, creatinine and urea nitrogen concentrations at 24 hr postdosing. Furthermore, there was no difference in serum AVP concentration, pituitary AVP content or the number and affinity of AVP receptors in the kidney and liver at trough throughout the study period. These results demonstrate that OPC-41061 is a highly potent human AVP V2-receptor antagonist and produces clear aquaresis after single and multiple dosing, suggesting the usefulness in the treatment of various water retaining states.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular cloning, sequencing, and functional expression of a cDNA encoding the human V1a vasopressin receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1994</h3>
                    <p>Vasopressin (AVP), the antidiuretic hormone, is a cyclic nonapeptide that acts through binding to G protein-coupled specific membrane receptors pharmacologically divided into three subtypes (V1a, V1b, and V2) linked to distinct second messengers. Within the family of human AVP receptors, the V2 AVP receptor has been cloned, but the structure of the human V1a and V1b AVP receptors remains unknown. We report here the structure and functional expression of a human V1a AVP receptor complementary DNA isolated from human liver cDNA libraries. Cloning and sequencing of a full-length clone isolated a 1472-nucleotide sequence encoding a 418-amino acid polypeptide with seven putative transmembrane domains typical of G protein-coupled receptors. Amino acid sequence identity with the rat liver V1a AVP receptor, the human and rat V2 AVP receptors, and the human oxytocin receptor was 72, 36, 37, and 45%, respectively. Functional characterization of the cloned receptor was done by transient expression in COS-7 cells and stable expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Localization of the expressed receptor at the cellular surface was illustrated by using the fluorescent linear analog phenylacetyl-D-Tyr(Et)-Phe-Gln-Asn-Lys-Pro-Arg-NH2 coupled to fluorescein-avidin by dodecabiotin. Competition binding experiments with phenylacetyl-D-Tyr(Et)-Phe-Val-Asn-Lys-Pro-[125I]Tyr-NH2 and AVP analogs revealed high affinity specific binding sites of the V1a subtype. Saturation binding experiments with [3H]AVP confirmed the presence of a single class of high affinity binding sites. Measurement of AVP-induced inositol phosphate production and calcium mobilization confirmed that the expressed V1a AVP receptor is coupled to phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. Thus, the human V1a AVP receptor belongs to the superfamily of seven-transmembrane segment receptors with a significant sequence identity with the other members of the AVP-oxytocin family of receptors.</p>
