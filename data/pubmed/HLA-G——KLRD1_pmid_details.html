                    <h2>Multiple receptors for HLA-G on human natural killer cells.</h2>
                    <h3>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; 1997</h3>
                    <p>HLA-G is the putative natural killer (NK) cell inhibitory ligand expressed on the extravillous cytotrophoblast of the human placenta. Killing of the class I negative human B cell line 721.221 by NK cells is inhibited by the expression of HLA-G. This inhibition is dependent on a high level of HLA-G expression. In the present study, the nature of the receptors that mediate the inhibition has been studied with 140 NK cell lines from two donors and 246 NK clones from 5 donors by blocking the inhibition using monoclonal antibodies against the known NK inhibitory receptors: CD158a, CD158b, and CD94. Both CD94 and the two CD158 proteins can function as receptors, although the former clearly predominates. In many cases, a combination of antibodies to these receptors is required to achieve maximal reversal of inhibition. Moreover, in at least one-third of the NK cells that are inhibited by HLA-G, these antibodies alone or in combination do not reverse inhibition, strongly suggesting the existence of a third major unidentified receptor for HLA-G.</p>

                    <h2>HLA-G recognition by human natural killer cells. Involvement of CD94 both as inhibitory and as activating receptor complex.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of immunology; 1997</h3>
                    <p>The lack of classical human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules in human placenta prevents the recognition and lysis by maternal T lymphocytes but poses the problem of susceptibility to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis. The nonclassical HLA class I molecule HLA-G may mediate protection from NK cells. NK cells are known to express a number of HLA class I-specific inhibitory receptors. These include members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily (p58, p70, p140), characterized by a defined allele specificity, and CD94/NKG2A with a broad specificity for different HLA class I molecules. We analyzed a series of NK cell clones derived from normal peripheral blood expressing different NK receptors (NKR). Clones were analyzed for their cytolytic activity against the HLA class I-negative 221 cell line either untransfected or transfected with HLA-G (221/G) or other informative alleles, as control. All clones expressing CD94/NKG2A [as identified by the Z199 monoclonal antibody (mAb)] displayed a markedly reduced cytolytic activity against 221/G. Moreover, mAb directed to the CD94/NKG2A complex completely restored target cell lysis. Among NKG2A-negative NK clones, different functional patterns could be detected. Clones expressing inhibitory receptors belonging to the Ig superfamily lysed 221/G target cells with equal or higher efficiency than untransfected 221 cells. These data indicated that p58, p70 and p140 do not function as HLA-G-specific inhibitory NKR, and that HLA-G-specific activating NKR also exist. Further analysis indicated that in these clones (characterized by the CD94+/NKG2A- phenotype) mAb specific for CD94, but not for the other NKR, reversed the activating effect. Infrequent clones were also isolated that, in spite of the lack of CD94/NKG2A, displayed HLA-G specificity, thus suggesting the existence of a different, still unknown NKR.</p>
