                    <h3>Science (New York, N.Y.); 1995</h3>
                    <p>A heptadecapeptide was identified and purified from porcine brain tissue as a ligand for an orphan heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor (LC132) that is similar in sequence to opioid receptors. This peptide, orphanin FQ, has a primary structure reminiscent of that of opioid peptides. Nanomolar concentrations of orphanin FQ inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in cells transfected with LC132. This inhibitory activity was not affected by the addition of opioid ligands, nor did the peptide activate opioid receptors. Orphanin FQ bound to its receptor in a saturable manner and with high affinity. When injected intracerebroventricularly into mice, orphanin FQ caused a decrease in locomotor activity but did not induce analgesia in the hot-plate test. However, the peptide produced hyperalgesia in the tail-flick assay. Thus, orphanin FQ may act as a transmitter in the brain by modulating nociceptive and locomotor behavior.</p>

                    <h2>Partial agonist behaviour depends upon the level of nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor expression: studies using the ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression system.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2003</h3>
                    <p>(1) Partial agonism is primarily dependent upon receptor density and coupling efficiency. As these parameters are tissue/model dependent, intrinsic activity in different tissues can vary. We have utilised the ecdysone-inducible expression system containing the human nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide receptor (hNOP) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOINDhNOP) to examine the activity of a range of partial agonists in receptor binding, GTPgamma35S binding and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase studies. (2) Incubation of CHOINDhNOP cells with ponasterone A (PON) induced hNOP expression ([leucyl-3H]N/OFQ binding) of 24, 68, 191 and 1101 fmol mg-1 protein at 1, 2, 5 and 10 microm PON, respectively. At 191 fmol mg-1, protein hNOP pharmacology was identical to that reported for other traditional expression systems. (3) pEC50 values for GTPgamma35S binding ranged from 7.23 to 7.72 (2-10 microm PON) for the partial agonist [Phe1psi(CH2-NH)Gly2]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 ([F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2) and 8.12-8.60 (1-10 microm PON) for N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and Emax values (stimulation factor relative to basal) ranged from 1.51 to 3.21 (2-10 microm PON) for [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and 1.28-6.95 (1-10 microm) for N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2. Intrinsic activity of [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 relative to N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 was 0.3-0.5. [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 did not stimulate GTPgamma35S binding at 1 microm PON, but competitively antagonised the effects of N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 with a pKB=7.62. (4) pEC50 values for cAMP inhibition ranged from 8.26 to 8.32 (2-10 microm PON) for [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and 9.42-10.35 for N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and Emax values (% inhibition) ranged from 19.6 to 83.2 for [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and 40.9-86.0 for N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2. The intrinsic activity of [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 relative to N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 was 0.48-0.97. (5) In the same cellular environment with receptor density as the only variable, we show that the profile of [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 can be manipulated to encompass full and partial agonism along with antagonism.</p>

                    <h2>Replacement of Gln280 by His in TM6 of the human ORL1 receptor increases affinity but reduces intrinsic activity of opioids.</h2>
                    <h3>FEBS letters; 1996</h3>
                    <p>The ORL1 (Opioid Receptor-Like) receptor is the G protein-coupled receptor whose amino acid sequence is closest to those of opioid receptors. Residues that are conserved in ORL1 and the three types of opioid receptor, but also a residue, His in the sixth putative transmembrane (TM6) helix, which is present in all opioid receptor types but absent in ORL1, appear to play a key role in receptor recognition and/or activation. Here we have sought to create an opioid binding pocket in the non-opioid ORL1 receptor by replacing residue Gln280 in its TM6 by the corresponding His residue of opioid receptors. The mutation affects neither the affinity of nociceptin - the natural ORL1 agonist - for the receptor, nor the potency of nociceptin to inhibit adenylyl cyclase via ORL1. In contrast, we find that a few opioid ligands, the agonists lofentanil, etorphine and dynorphin A, and especially the antagonists diprenorphine and nor-BNI, bind the mutant Q280H receptor with substantially (5- to > 100-fold) higher apparent affinity than they do the wild-type receptor. Moreover, lofentanil and etorphine no longer act as pure agonists, as they do at the native ORL1 receptor, but are endowed with clear antagonist properties at the mutant receptor. The mutation Q280H, which increases affinity while decreasing intrinsic activity of opioids at ORL1, emphasizes the importance of the His residue for opioid recognition and activation.</p>

                    <h2>Comparison of the effects of [Phe1psi(CH2-NH)Gly2]nociceptin(1-13)NH2 in rat brain, rat vas deferens and CHO cells expressing recombinant human nociceptin receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 1999</h3>
                    <p>Nociceptin(NC) is the endogenous ligand for the opioid receptor like-1 receptor (NC-receptor). [Phe1(psi)(CH2-NH)Gly2]Nociceptin(1-13)NH2 ([F/G]NC(1-13)NH2) has been reported to antagonize NC actions in peripheral guinea-pig and mouse tissues. In this study, we investigated the effects of a range of NC C-terminal truncated fragments and [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 on NC receptor binding, glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical slices (rCX), inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in CHO cells expressing the NC receptor (CHO(NCR)) and electrically evoked contractions of the rat vas deferens (rVD). In radioligand binding assays, a range of ligands inhibited [125I]-Tyr14-NC binding in membranes from rCX and CHO(NCR) cells. As the peptide was truncated there was a general decline in pKi. [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 was as potent as NC(1-13)NH2. The order of potency for NC fragments to inhibit cyclic AMP accumulation in whole CHO(NCR) cells was NCNH2> or =NC=NC(1-13)NH2>NC(1-12)NH2> >NC(1-11)NH2. [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 was a full agonist with a pEC50 value of 8.65. NCNH2 and [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 both inhibited K+ evoked glutamate release from rCX with pEC50 and maximum inhibition of 8.16, 48.5+/-4.9% and 7.39, 58.9+/-6.8% respectively. In rVD NC inhibited electrically evoked contractions with a pEC50 of 6.63. Although [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2, displayed a small (instrinsic activity alpha = 0.19) but consistent residual agonist activity, it acted as a competitive antagonist (pA2 6.76) in the rVD. The differences between [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 action on central and peripheral NC signalling could be explained if [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 was a partial agonist with high strength of coupling in the CNS and low in the periphery. An alternative explanation could be the existence of central and peripheral receptor isoforms.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological characterisation of [(pX)Phe4]nociceptin(1-13)amide analogues. 1. In vitro studies.</h2>
                    <h3>Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Phe(4) in the nociceptin (NC) sequence has been identified as the most critical residue for receptor interaction. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacological activity of a series of NC(1-13)NH(2) analogues, in which the hydrogen atom in the para position of Phe(4) was substituted with F, NO(2), CN, Cl, Br, I, CH(3), OH or NH(2). In receptor binding studies, performed using CHO cells expressing the recombinant human NC receptor (CHO(hOP4)) and in rat cerebral cortex membranes, [(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2), [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2), and [(pCN)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) displayed higher affinity than NC(1-13)NH(2). The affinity of [(pCl)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) was essentially identical to that of NC(1-13)NH(2), while the remaining compounds displayed reduced affinity. In a series of functional assays (stimulation of GTPgammaS binding in CHO(hOP4)cells and rat cerebral cortex membranes and inhibition of cAMP accumulation in CHO(hOP4) cells), the para substituted analogues behaved as full agonists (with the exception of [(pOH)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) which acted as a partial agonist in the GTPgammaS binding assays) with the following rank order potency:[(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) and [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) were either inactive or displayed micromolar potencies in cAMP accumulation experiments performed on cells expressing classical opioid receptors. All compounds were full agonists in isolated tissues from various species (guinea pig ileum, mouse colon and mouse/rat vas deferens) with the exception of [(pOH)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) which displayed partial agonist/weak antagonist activities. The rank order of potency was similar to that found in the other assays. The effects of all analogues were not modified by naloxone. The selective OP(4) receptor antagonist [Nphe(1)]NC(1-13)NH(2), tested in all preparations against one or both of the highly potent derivatives [(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) and [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2), showed pA(2) values similar to those found against NC, the pA(2) in the GTPgammaS binding/rat cerebral cortex assay being much higher (ca. 7.5) than in the other functional assays (ca. 6). This study further supports the notion that Phe(4) of NC is the critical residue for receptor occupation and activation. Moreover, as part of this study, we have identified two novel, highly potent and selective agonists for the OP(4) receptor, [(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) and [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2).</p>

                    <p>Intrathecally (i.t.) administered nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) evokes antinociceptive effects in rodents. Recent studies in monkeys demonstrated that i.t. co-application of N/OFQ and morphine elicits synergistic antinociceptive actions suggesting mixed N/OFQ peptide (NOP) and μ opioid receptor agonists as innovative spinal analgesics. Thus, novel N/OFQ related peptides were synthesized in order to identify and pharmacologically characterize a mixed NOP/ μ opioid receptor agonist.</p>

                    <h2>Functional inactivation of the nociceptin receptor by alanine substitution of glutamine 286 at the C terminus of transmembrane segment VI: evidence from a site-directed mutagenesis study of the ORL1 receptor transmembrane-binding domain.</h2>
                    <h3>Molecular pharmacology; 2000</h3>
                    <p>A site-directed mutagenesis approach has been used to gain insight into the molecular events whereby the heptadecapeptide nociceptin binds and activates the opioid receptor-like 1 (ORL1) receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor. Alanine mutation, in the human ORL1 receptor, of transmembrane amino acid residues that are conserved in opioid receptors, Asp(130) and Tyr(131) in transmembrane segment (TM) III, Phe(220) and Phe(224) in TM V, and Trp(276) in TM VI, yields mutant receptors with reduced affinity, and proportionally decreased reactivity, toward nociceptin. Least to most deleterious in this respect are Ala substitutions of Phe(220) approximately W276A < Tyr(131) << Phe(224) </= Asp(130). The dramatic effects of the D130A mutation on nociceptin binding and activity are not reversed in the D130N mutant, whereas those of the Y131A mutation are totally suppressed in Y131F. This suggests that a negative charge at position 130, and a phenyl ring at position 131 in TM III, are critical for occupancy and/or activation of the receptor by nociceptin. Alanine replacement of glutamine 286, located at the C terminus of TM VI, yields a mutant receptor that binds nociceptin with nearly the same affinity as does the wild-type receptor (K(d) values of 0.13 and 0.22 nM, respectively) but, unlike the latter, is unable to mediate nociceptin inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP synthesis in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells (ED(50) > 10,000 nM compared with 0.8 nM at the wild-type receptor). In all respects, this mutant receptor appears to be functionally inactive, indicating that residue Gln(286) may play a pivotal role in ORL1 receptor-mediated transduction of the nociceptin signal.</p>

                    <h2>Highly potent nociceptin analog containing the Arg-Lys triple repeat.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical and biophysical research communications; 2000</h3>
                    <p>One of the structural characteristics of a neuropeptide nociceptin is the existence of Arg-Lys (RK) residues at positions 8-9 and 12-13; both RKs have been suggested to bind to the acidic amino acid cluster in the second extracellular loop of the seven transmembrane domain receptor ORL1. With a design strategy of attempting to obtain an analog that binds more strongly to the receptor's acidic cluster, we synthesized a series of nociceptin analogs in which the RK dipeptide unit was placed at positions 6-7, 10-11, or 14-15 adjacent to the parent RKs. Among these nociceptin analogs containing the RK triple repeat, [Arg-Lys(6-7)]- and [Arg-Lys(10-11)]nociceptins exhibited weak activities (6-9 and 60-90% of nociceptin, respectively) both in the receptor binding assay and in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding functional assay. In contrast, [Arg-Lys(14-15)]nociceptin was found to be very potent in both assays (3-fold in binding and 17-fold in GTPgammaS functional assay). [Arg-Lys(14-15)]nociceptin was the first peptide analog found to be stronger than the parent nociceptin, and structure-activity studies have suggested that the incorporated Arg-Lys(14-15) interacts with either the receptor acidic amino acid cluster or the receptor aromatic amino acid residues.</p>
