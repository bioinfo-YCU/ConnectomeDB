                    <h2>Activation of orphan receptors by the hormone relaxin.</h2>
                    <h3>Science (New York, N.Y.); 2002</h3>
                    <p>Relaxin is a hormone important for the growth and remodeling of reproductive and other tissues during pregnancy. Although binding sites for relaxin are widely distributed, the nature of its receptor has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that two orphan heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors, LGR7 and LGR8, are capable of mediating the action of relaxin through an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent pathway distinct from that of the structurally related insulin and insulin-like growth factor family ligand. Treatment of antepartum mice with the soluble ligand-binding region of LGR7 caused parturition delay. The wide and divergent distribution of the two relaxin receptors implicates their roles in reproductive, brain, renal, cardiovascular, and other functions.</p>

                    <h2>Multiple binding sites revealed by interaction of relaxin family peptides with native and chimeric relaxin family peptide receptors 1 and 2 (LGR7 and LGR8).</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 2005</h3>
                    <p>Relaxin family peptide 1 (RXFP1) receptor (LGR7) and RXFP2 receptor (LGR8) were recently identified as the receptor targets for H2 relaxin and insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), respectively. In this study, we define the pharmacology of these two receptors by using a number of receptor chimeras and relaxin family peptides. We have identified two binding sites on these receptors: one primary, high-affinity site within the ectodomain and a secondary, lower affinity site within the transmembrane region. The primary site was found to dictate receptor binding characteristics, although the lower affinity site also exerts some influence and modulates ligand affinity for the primary site in a manner dependent upon the peptide in question. Not all relaxin peptides were able to bind to the RXFP2 receptor, indicating that the relaxin-RXFP2 receptor interaction is species-specific. INSL3 was found to exhibit characteristics of a partial agonist at the RXFP2 and chimeric RXFP1/2 receptors, with low maximal cAMP responses but high potency in coupling to this pathway. cAMP accumulation studies also revealed that the binding sites couple to cAMP signaling pathways with differing efficiency: the high-affinity site signals with high efficiency, whereas the lower affinity site signals with little to no efficiency. Comparisons between RXFP1, RXFP2, the chimeric receptors, and the truncated receptors revealed that the interaction between receptor sites is critical for optimal ligand binding and signal transduction and that the ectodomain is essential for signaling. Evidence obtained in this study supports a two-stage binding model of receptor activation: binding to the primary site allows a conformational change and interaction with the low-affinity transmembrane site.</p>

                    <h2>H3 relaxin is a specific ligand for LGR7 and activates the receptor by interacting with both the ectodomain and the exoloop 2.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Leucine-rich repeat-containing, G protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) represent a unique subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors with a large ectodomain. Recent studies demonstrated that relaxin activates two orphan LGRs, LGR7 and LGR8, whereas INSL3/Leydig insulin-like peptide specifically activates LGR8. Human relaxin 3 (H3 relaxin) was recently discovered as a novel ligand for relaxin receptors. Here, we demonstrate that H3 relaxin activates LGR7 but not LGR8. Taking advantage of the overlapping specificity of these three ligands for the two related LGRs, chimeric receptors were generated to elucidate the mechanism of ligand activation of LGR7. Chimeric receptor LGR7/8 with the ectodomain from LGR7 but the transmembrane region from LGR8 maintains responsiveness to relaxin but was less responsive to H3 relaxin based on ligand stimulation of cAMP production. The decreased ligand signaling was accompanied by decreases in the ability of H3 relaxin to compete for (33)P-relaxin binding to the chimeric receptor. However, replacement of the exoloop 2, but not exoloop 1 or 3, of LGR7 to the chimeric LGR7/8 restored ligand binding and receptor-mediated cAMP production. These results suggested that activation of LGR7 by H3 relaxin involves specific binding of the ligand to both the ectodomain and the exoloop 2, thus providing a model with which to understand the molecular basis of ligand signaling for this unique subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors.</p>
