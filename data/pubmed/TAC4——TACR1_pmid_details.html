                    <h2>Hemokinin is a hematopoietic-specific tachykinin that regulates B lymphopoiesis.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature immunology; 2000</h3>
                    <p>We report here the molecular cloning of a newly identified preprotachykinin gene, Pptc, which specifies the sequence for a new preprotachykinin protein and bioactive peptide designated hemokinin 1 (HK-1). PPT-C mRNA was detected primarily in hematopoietic cells in contrast to the previously described Ppta and Pptb genes, which are predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues. HK-1 has several biological activities that are similar to the most studied tachykinin, substance P, such as induction of plasma extravasation and mast cell degranulation. However, HK-1 also has properties that are indicative of a critical role in mouse B cell development. HK-1 stimulated the proliferation of interleukin 7-expanded B cell precursors, whereas substance P had no effect. HK-1, but not substance P, promoted the survival of freshly isolated bone marrow B lineage cells or cultured, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated pre-B cells. N-acetyl-L-trytophan-3,5-bistrifluromethyl benzyl ester, a tachykinin receptor antagonist, increased apoptosis of these cells and in vivo administration of this antagonist led to specific reductions of the B220lowCD43 population (the pre-B cell compartment) in the bone marrow and the IgMhighIgDlow population (the newly generated B cells) in the spleen. Thus, HK-1 may be an autocrine factor that is important for the survival of B cell precursors at a critical phase of development.</p>

                    <h2>Hemokinins and endokinins.</h2>
                    <h3>Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS; 2004</h3>
                    <p>The mammalian tachykinins are a family of peptides that, until recently, has included substance P (SP), neurokinin A and neurokinin B. Since, the discovery of a third preprotachykinin gene ( TAC4), the number of tachykinins has more than doubled to reveal several species-divergent peptides. This group includes hemokinin-1 (HK-1) in mouse and rat, endokinin-1 (EK-1) in rabbit, and EKA, EKB, human HK-1 (hHK-1) and hHK(4-11) in humans. Each exhibits a remarkable selectivity and potency for the tachykinin NK(1) receptor similar to SP. Their peripheral expression has led to the proposal that they are the endogenous peripheral SP-like endocrine/paracrine agonists where SP is not expressed. Moreover, their strong cross-reactivity with a specific SP antibody leads us to question many of the proposed locations and roles of SP in the periphery. Additionally, three orphan tachykinin gene-related peptides are identified on TAC4, in rabbit, EK-2 and in humans, EKC and EKD.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological profile of the novel mammalian tachykinin, hemokinin 1.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>1. The effects of the novel mammalian tachykinin, hemokinin 1 (HEK-1), have been investigated by radioligand binding and functional in vitro and in vivo experiments. 2. Similar to SP (K(i)=0.13 nM), HEK-1 inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner and with high affinity [(3)H]-substance P (SP) binding to human NK(1) receptor (K(i)=0.175 nM) while its affinity for [(125)I]-neurokinin A (NKA) binding at human NK(2) receptor was markedly lower (K(i)=560 nM). 3. In isolated bioassays HEK-1 was a full agonist at tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptors. In the rat urinary bladder (RUB) HEK-1 was about 3 fold less potent than SP. In the rabbit pulmonary artery (RPA) HEK-1 and in the guinea-pig ileum (GPI), HEK-1 was about 500 fold less potent than NKA and NKB, respectively. 4. The responses to HEK-1 were antagonized by GR 82334 in RUB (pK(B)=5.6+/-0.07), by nepadutant in RPA (pK(B)=8.6+/-0.04) and by SR 142801 in GPI (pK(B)=9.0+/-0.2) with apparent affinities comparable to that measured against tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptor-selective agonists, respectively. 5. Intravenous HEK-1 produced dose-related decrease of blood pressure in anaesthetized guinea-pigs (ED(50)=0.1 nmol kg(-1)) and salivary secretion in anaesthetized rats (ED(50)=6 nmol kg(-1)) with potencies similar to that of SP. All these effects were blocked by the selective tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonist, SR 140333. 6. We conclude that HEK-1 is a full agonist at tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptors, possesses a remarkable selectivity for NK(1) as compared to NK(2) or NK(3) receptors and acts in vivo experiments with potency similar to that of SP.</p>
