                    <h2>Both interleukin-8 receptors independently mediate chemotaxis. Jurkat cells transfected with IL-8R1 or IL-8R2 migrate in response to IL-8, GRO alpha and NAP-2.</h2>
                    <h3>FEBS letters; 1994</h3>
                    <p>Neutrophil leukocytes, the target cells for interleukin-8 and related CXC chemokines, bear high numbers of two types of IL-8 receptors (IL-8R1 and IL-8R2). By cDNA transfection Jurkat cell lines were generated that stably express either IL-8R1 or IL-8R2 (J-IL8R1 and J-IL8R2). J-IL8R1 expressed 4,000 +/- 1,000 copies of IL-8R1, and bound IL-8 with high affinity (Kd 1-4 nM) and GRO alpha and NAP-2 with low affinity (Kd 200-500 nM). J-IL8R2 expressed 17,000 +/- 3,000 copies of IL-8R2, and bound all three chemokines with high affinity. Both transfectants showed a similar degree of chemotactic migration after stimulation with IL-8, GRO alpha and NAP-2. All three chemokines were equally potent as attractants of J-IL8R2, whereas IL-8 was 300 to 1,000-fold more potent than GRO alpha or NAP-2 as attractant of J-IL8R1. The potencies, therefore, agree with the affinities of the ligands to IL-8R1 and IL-8R2. Our results demonstrate that both IL-8 receptors function independently, and mediate chemotaxis in response to IL-8 and other CXC chemokines.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of two high affinity human interleukin-8 receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1992</h3>
                    <p>Interleukin 8 (IL-8) and melanocyte growth-stimulatory activity/gro (MGSA) are structurally related proinflammatory cytokines that are chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils. Recently, cDNA clones encoding a high affinity IL-8 receptor (IL-8R-A) and a "low affinity" IL-8 receptor (IL-8R-B) have been isolated from human cDNA libraries. These two receptors have 77% amino acid identity and are members of the G protein-coupled superfamily of receptors with seven transmembrane domains. We have expressed these two receptors in mammalian cells and find that in this system both receptors bind IL-8 with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The receptor affinities differ for MGSA, however. IL-8R-A binds MGSA with low affinity (Kd approximately 450 nM); IL-8R-B binds MGSA with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The transfected cells respond to ligand binding with a transient increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. A Ca2+ response is found for IL-8R-A following the binding of IL-8; no response is found for MGSA. A Ca2+ response for IL-8R-B follows the binding of both ligands. Blot hybridization with oligonucleotide probes specific for the two receptors shows that mRNA for both receptors is present in human neutrophils. Analysis of IL-8 and MGSA binding data on neutrophils as well as Ca2+ response and desensitization data shows that the presence of these two IL-8 receptors on the cell surface can account for the profile of these two ligands on neutrophils.</p>

                    <h2>Signalling by CXC-chemokine receptors 1 and 2 expressed in CHO cells: a comparison of calcium mobilization, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and stimulation of GTPgammaS binding induced by IL-8 and GROalpha.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 1999</h3>
                    <p>The effect of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and growth-related oncogene alpha (GROalpha) on [35S]-guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) ([35S]GTPgammaS) binding, forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation and cytosolic calcium concentration were determined in recombinant CHO cells expressing HA-tagged CXC-chemokine receptors 1 and 2 (CXCR1 and CXCR2). Radioligand binding assays confirmed that the binding profiles of the recombinant receptors were similar to those of the native proteins. IL-8 displaced [125I]-IL-8 binding to CXCR1 and CXCR2 with pKi values of 8.89+/-0.05 and 9.27+/-0.03, respectively. GROalpha, a selective CXCR2 ligand, had a pKi value of 9.66+/-0.39 at CXCR2 but a pKi>8 at CXCR1. Calcium mobilization experiments were also consistent with previous reports on native receptors. Activation of both receptors resulted in stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. A comparison of the functional data at CXCRI showed that a similar potency order (IL-8> >GROalpha) was obtained in all three assays. However, at CXCR2 whilst the potency orders for calcium mobilization and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase were similar (IL-8 > or = GROalpha), the order was reversed for stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding (GROalpha > IL-8). All of the functional responses at both receptors were inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX), suggesting coupling to a Gi/Go protein. However, the calcium mobilization induced by IL-8 at CXCR1 was not fully inhibited by PTX, suggesting an interaction with a G-protein of the Gq family. Our results with pertussis toxin also suggested that, in the [35S]GTPgammaS binding assay, CXCR1 displays some constitutive activity. Thus, we have characterized the binding and several functional responses at HA-tagged CXCRs 1 and 2 and have shown that their pharmacology agrees well with that of the native receptors. We also have preliminary evidence that CXCR1 displays constitutive activity in our cell line and that CXCR2 may traffic between different PTX sensitive G-proteins.</p>

                    <h2>The CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors form constitutive homo- and heterodimers selectively and with equal apparent affinities.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2005</h3>
                    <p>Both homo- and heterodimeric interactions between the CXCR1 and CXCR2 chemokine receptors were observed following co-expression of forms of these receptors in HEK293 cells using assays, including co-immunoprecipitation, single cell imaging of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, cell surface time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. These interactions were constitutive and unaffected by the presence of the agonist interleukin 8 and selective as no significant interactions were noted between either the CXCR1 or CXCR2 receptor and the alpha(1A)-adrenoreceptor. Saturation bioluminescence resonance energy transfer indicated that heteromeric interactions between CXCR1 and CXCR2 were of similar affinity as the corresponding homomeric interactions. A novel endoplasmic reticulum trapping strategy demonstrated that these interactions were initiated during protein synthesis and maturation and prior to cell surface delivery. These studies indicated that CXCR1-CXCR2 heterodimers are as likely to form in cells co-expressing these two chemokine receptors as the corresponding homodimers and stand in contrast to previous studies indicating an inability of the CXCR1 receptor to homodimerize or to interact with the CXCR2 receptor (Trettel, F., Di Bartolomeo, S., Lauro, C., Catalano, M., Ciotti, M. T., and Limatola, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 40980-40988).</p>

                    <h2>Discrete steps in binding and signaling of interleukin-8 with its receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>The mechanisms by which chemokines bind and signal through their receptors are complex and poorly understood. In the present study, we sought to dissect these processes and to map important functional domains of the two CXC chemokine (interleukin-8) receptors, CXCR1 (formally IL-8RA) and CXCR2 (formally IL-8RB), using blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the receptors and a series of chimeras between CXCR1 and CXCR2. A panel of specific mAbs against CXCR1 or CXCR2, generated by immunizing mice with transfectants expressing either receptor, were shown to effectively block IL-8- and/or growth-related oncogene alpha (GROalpha) -mediated ligand binding, chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding in CXCR1 and CXCR2 transfectants and/or human neutrophils. Of particular interest was an anti-CXCR1 mAb, 7D9, that inhibited chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding but had no detectable effects on ligand binding. The epitopes of these blocking mAbs were mapped by using a series of CXCR1/2 chimera transfectants and synthetic peptides. Most of the anti-CXCR1 antibodies, except 7D9, mapped to the amino acid sequence WDFDDL (CXCR1 residues 10-15), and all the anti-CXCR2 antibodies mapped to the amino acid sequence FEDFW (CXCR2 residues 6-10). The epitope of mAb 7D9 mainly involved a region within the first 45 residues of CXCR1, and it appeared to be conformation-sensitive. These results support a model in which the binding and signaling of IL-8 with its receptor occur in at least two discrete steps involving distinct domains of the receptor. This model is consistent with the notion that discrete conformational changes of the receptor secondary to ligand binding are required to trigger various biological responses. Moreover, the ligand binding and chemotaxis properties of each CXCR1/2 chimeric receptor to IL-8 and GROalpha were determined. It was found that each is distinct in its ability to confer ligand binding and chemotactic response to IL-8 and GROalpha, and two conclusions could be made. 1) The N-terminal segment of CXCR1 is a dominant determinant of receptor subtype selectivity, consistent with previous studies using rabbit/human CXCR1/2 chimeras; and 2) the specificity determinant for GROalpha binding in CXCR2 involves sequences in the N terminus, distal to the first 15 residues, as well as other parts of the receptor.</p>

                    <h3>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; 2004</h3>
                    <p>The chemokine CXC ligand 8 (CXCL8)/IL-8 and related agonists recruit and activate polymorphonuclear cells by binding the CXC chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) and CXCR2. Here we characterize the unique mode of action of a small-molecule inhibitor (Repertaxin) of CXCR1 and CXCR2. Structural and biochemical data are consistent with a noncompetitive allosteric mode of interaction between CXCR1 and Repertaxin, which, by locking CXCR1 in an inactive conformation, prevents signaling. Repertaxin is an effective inhibitor of polymorphonuclear cell recruitment in vivo and protects organs against reperfusion injury. Targeting the Repertaxin interaction site of CXCR1 represents a general strategy to modulate the activity of chemoattractant receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Structure and functional expression of a human interleukin-8 receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Science (New York, N.Y.); 1991</h3>
                    <p>Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a member of a family of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although the best characterized activities of IL-8 include the chemoattraction and activation of neutrophils, other members of this family have a wide range of specific actions including the chemotaxis and activation of monocytes, the selective chemotaxis of memory T cells, the inhibition of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, and the induction of neutrophil infiltration in vivo. A complementary DNA encoding the IL-8 receptor from human neutrophils has now been isolated. The amino acid sequence shows that the receptor is a member of the superfamily of receptors that couple to guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). The sequence is 29% identical to that of receptors for the other neutrophil chemoattractants, fMet-Leu-Phe and C5a. Mammalian cells transfected with the IL-8 receptor cDNA clone bind IL-8 with high affinity and respond specifically to IL-8 by transiently mobilizing calcium. The IL-8 receptor may be part of a subfamily of related G protein-coupled receptors that transduce signals for the IL-8 family of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>
