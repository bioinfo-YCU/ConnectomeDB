                    <h2>Molecular cloning, functional expression, and signal transduction of the GIP-receptor cloned from a human insulinoma.</h2>
                    <h3>FEBS letters; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) plays an important role in the regulation of postprandial insulin secretion and proinsulin gene expression of pancreatic beta-cells. This study demonstrates the molecular cloning of a cDNA for the GIP-receptor from a human insulinoma lambda gt11 cDNA library. The cloned cDNA encoded a seven transmembrane domain protein of 466 amino acids which showed high homology (41%) to the human glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor. Homology to the GIP receptor from rat or hamster was 79% and 81%, respectively. When transfected stably into fibroblast CHL-cells a high affinity receptor was expressed which coupled to the adenylate cyclase with normal basal cAMP and increasing intracellular cAMP levels under stimulation with human GIP-1-42 (EC50 = 1.29 x 10(-13) M). The receptor accepted only human GIP 1-42 (Kd = 1.93 +/- 0.2 x 10(-8) M) and porcine truncated GIP 1-30 (Kd = 1.13 +/- 0.1 x 10(-8) M) as high affinity ligands. At 1 microM, exendin-4 and (9-39)amide weakly reduced GIP-binding (25%) whereas secretin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, peptide histidine-isoleucine, and pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide were without effect. In transfected CHL cells, GIP-1-42 did not increase intracellular calcium. Northern analysis revealed one transcript of human GIP receptor mRNA with an apparent size of 5.5 kb. The exact understanding of GIP receptor regulation and signal transduction will aid in the understanding of the incretin hormone's failure to exert its biological action at the pancreatic B-cell in type II diabetes mellitus.</p>

                    <h2>GLP-1/GIP chimeric peptides define the structural requirements for specific ligand-receptor interaction of GLP-1.</h2>
                    <h3>Regulatory peptides; 1996</h3>
                    <p>The gastrointestinal hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) strongly stimulate insulin release. Despite their high N-terminal sequence similarity, GLP-1 does not bind to the GIP receptor and vice versa. To characterize the domains required for interaction of the peptide ligands with their specific receptors, we performed displacement studies with various synthetic GLP-1/GIP hybrid peptides on RINm5F insulinoma cells. Displacement of 125I-GIP and 125I-GLP-1 was measured using GLP-1/GIP chimeras which comprised GIP and GLP-1 sequences at different positions. The binding affinity to the GLP-1 receptor was found to be sensitive to GIP-like exchanges in the N-terminal 22 amino acids as well as in positions 13 and 15 (loss of affinity 280-fold to more than 1000-fold). C-terminal substitution of the GLP-1 sequence by GIP diminished the affinity towards the GLP-1 receptor only 20-fold. All hybrid peptides investigated showed minimal binding affinity for the GIP receptor, indicating that the entire GIP-sequence (1-31) is important for receptor recognition. These findings provide insight into the structural requirements for the specific interaction of two important insulinotropic peptides with their specific receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Structure-function analysis of a series of novel GIP analogues containing different helical length linkers.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP1-42) is a potent glucose-lowering intestinal peptide hormone. The equipotent GIP1-30NH2 was structurally modified by linking N- and C-terminal fragments with several different linkers. Substitution of the middle region of GIP by a flexible aminohexanoic linker resulted in greatly reduced binding affinity and reduction or complete loss of bioactivity. Connection of the bioactive domains GIP1-14 and GIP19-30NH2 by EKEK or AAAA linkers resulted in peptide agonists with approximately 3-4-fold increased bioactivity as compared to GIP1-30NH2. Conformational analysis by CD spectroscopy of GIP fragments and analogues suggests a helical region in the C-terminal (19-30) portion of GIP. It was demonstrated that stabilization of this C-terminal helical region by the introduction of helical linkers favored binding and activation of the GIP receptor. Our results suggest an important contribution of a direct interaction of the first 14 amino acids with the GIP receptor, an appropriate relative orientation of N- and C-terminal parts of GIP, and the presence of helical linkers to be essential for bioactivity.</p>
