                    <h2>The orphan receptor C5L2 has high affinity binding sites for complement fragments C5a and C5a des-Arg(74).</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2002</h3>
                    <p>The substantial variations in the responses of cells to the anaphylatoxin C5a and its desarginated form, C5adR(74), suggest that more than one type of cell surface receptor for these ligands might exist. However, only a single receptor for C5a and C5adR(74), CD88, has been characterized to date. Here we report that the orphan receptor C5L2/gpr77, which shares 35% amino acid identity with CD88, binds C5a with high affinity but has a 10-fold higher affinity for C5adR(74) than CD88. C5L2 also has a moderate affinity for anaphylatoxin C3a, but cross-competition studies suggest that C3a binds to a distinct site from C5a. C4a was able to displace C3a, suggesting that C5L2, like the C3a receptor, may have a low binding affinity for this anaphylatoxin. Unlike CD88 and C3a receptor, C5L2 transfected into RBL-2H3 cells does not support degranulation or increases in intracellular [Ca(2+)] and is not rapidly internalized in response to ligand binding. However, ligation of C5L2 by anaphylatoxin did potentiate the degranulation response to cross-linkage of the high affinity IgE receptor by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. These results suggest that C5L2 is an anaphylatoxin-binding protein with unique ligand binding and signaling properties.</p>

                    <h2>C5L2, a nonsignaling C5A binding protein.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>C5a anaphylatoxin, a potent inflammatory mediator, is known to act through a specific G protein coupled receptor. However, some of the complex effects of C5a in vivo may not be explained solely by the deletion of the known receptor. Here, we show that an orphan receptor, identified as C5L2, is a high affinity C5a binding protein. Unlike the previously described C5aR, C5L2 is obligately uncoupled from heterotrimeric G proteins, in part by virtue of an amino acid alteration in the so-called DRY sequence at the end of the third transmembrane segment. Both human and murine C5L2 bear a leucine for arginine replacement at this site. C5L2, when transfected into several cell types, is weakly phosphorylated in transfected cells following binding of C5a but does not induce significant activation of MAP kinases, mediate calcium flux, or stimulate chemotaxis. Bone marrow cells from wild type respond robustly to C5a with induction and suppression of a number of inflammation related genes. In contrast, C5a receptor deficient mice, which bear C5L2 alone, do not respond to C5a with changes in gene transcription by microarray analyses. Biophysical properties of the C5L2, including slow ligand on and off rates, absence of internalization, and relatively high affinity for the C5a des Arg metabolite, suggest that this receptor may serve to modulate C5a biological functions in vivo. Finally, in contrast to previous reports, we find absolutely no interaction of C5L2 with other anaphylatoxins C3a and C4a.</p>
