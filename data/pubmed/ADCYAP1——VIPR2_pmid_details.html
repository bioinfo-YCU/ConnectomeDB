                    <h2>A systematic comparison of intracellular cyclic AMP and calcium signalling highlights complexities in human VPAC/PAC receptor pharmacology.</h2>
                    <h3>Neuropharmacology; 2006</h3>
                    <p>VPAC/PAC receptor activation classically results in cyclic-AMP production, with limited reports evaluating calcium signalling. These studies systematically characterise intracellular cyclic-AMP ([cAMP](i)) and calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) responses in CHO-cells expressing recombinant human (h) VPAC/PAC receptors (hVPAC(1)R, hVPAC(2)R, hPAC(1)R), using two simple, non-radioactive, HT-amenable assays. The rank order of potency (ROP) of the agonists VIP, PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 was similar in both assays for each individual receptor subtype, although potencies (EC(50)) in the [Ca(2+)](i) assay were approximately 100-fold lower. Importantly, this shift was also evident in SHSY-5Y cells endogenously expressing hPAC(1)R. Furthermore, [Ala(11,22,28)]VIP and maxadilan were selective hVPAC(1)R and hPAC(1)R agonists, respectively, and although R3P65 had no demonstrable hVPAC(2)R selectivity, these compounds exhibited comparable reductions in [Ca(2+)](i) EC(50) values. In contrast, PG97-269 and PG99-465, putatively selective hVPAC(1)R and hVPAC(2)R antagonists, respectively, were marginally less potent in [cAMP](i) studies, whereas M65 was equipotent at hPAC(1)R. Moreover, PG99-465 alone increased [cAMP](i) at all three hVPAC/PAC receptor subtypes, with full hVPAC(1)R and hPAC(1)R agonism. With equivalent agonist ROPs generated in both assays, [Ca(2+)](i) signalling provides an alternative approach to examine hVPAC/PAC receptor pharmacology. However, these studies underscore the paucity of receptor selective compounds, complexities in comparing drug potencies across assays, and the pleiotropic nature of VPAC/PAC-receptor signalling.</p>

                    <h2>A potent and highly selective VPAC2 agonist enhances glucose-induced insulin release and glucose disposal: a potential therapy for type 2 diabetes.</h2>
                    <h3>Diabetes; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) activate two shared receptors, VPAC1 and VPAC2. Activation of VPAC1 has been implicated in elevating glucose output, whereas activation of VPAC2 may be involved in insulin secretion. A hypothesis that a VPAC2-selective agonist would enhance glucose disposal by stimulating insulin secretion without causing increased hepatic glucose production was tested using a novel selective agonist of VPAC2. This agonist, BAY 55-9837, was generated through site-directed mutagenesis based on sequence alignments of PACAP, VIP, and related analogs. The peptide bound to VPAC2 with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 0.65 nmol/l and displayed >100-fold selectivity over VPAC1. BAY 55-9837 stimulated glucose-dependent insulin secretion in isolated rat and human pancreatic islets, increased insulin synthesis in purified rat islets, and caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma insulin levels in fasted rats, with a half-maximal stimulatory concentration of 3 pmol/kg. Continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion of the peptide reduced the glucose area under the curve following an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. The peptide had effects on intestinal water retention and mean arterial blood pressure in rats, but only at much higher doses. BAY 55-9837 may be a useful therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p>

                    <h2>Analogues of VIP, helodermin, and PACAP discriminate between rat and human VIP1 and VIP2 receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) acts through interaction with two subclasses of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors named VIP1 and VIP2 receptors. These receptors have been cloned in different species, such as rat and human. Considering the different distribution of both receptor subclasses, there is considerable interest in the development of selective agonists and antagonists. The present study compares the binding properties of VIP, PACAP, GRF, secretin, and helodermin analogues on recombinant rat and human VIP1 and VIP2 receptors. On both rat and human receptors, secretin and GRF had a higher affinity for the VIP1 receptor subtypes. The amino-shortened VIP, and the carboxy terminal-shortened VIP and PACAP analogues also presented a higher affinity for the VIP1 receptor. PHI, PHV, helodermin, and helospectin were selective for the human VIP2 receptor subtypes. These results suggest that the helical structure of the carboxy terminal end is necessary for VIP2 recognition. The differences between species were the following: PHI, PHV, helodermin, and helospectin had a higher affinity for the rat VIP1 receptor than for the human VIP1 receptor. On both rat and human receptors, D-Ala4 VIP and D-Phe4 VIP had a high affinity for the VIP1 receptor and a low affinity for the VIP2 receptor. Thus, three domains of the ligand involved in VIP1/VIP2 receptor discrimination were identified: the amino acid residue in position 4 ([D-Ala4], [D-Phe4]VIP), in positions 8 and 9 (the effects of helodermin and helospectin), and the carboxy terminal end (the effects of the shortened VIP and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide analogues).</p>

                    <h3>Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN; 2002</h3>
                    <p>The effects of a (N-stearyl, Norleucine17) vasoactive intestinal peptide hybrid ((SN)VIPhybrid) on cells stably transfected with VPAC,, VPAC2, or PAC1 receptors were investigated. (SN)VIPhybrid inhibited specific 125I-VIP binding to membranes derived from CHO cells transfected with VPAC, or VPAC2 receptors with high affinity (IC50 = 30 and 50 nM). (SN)VIPhyb inhibited specific 125I-PACAP-27 binding to membranes derived from NIH/3T3 cells transfected with PAC1 receptors with high affinity (IC50 = 65 nM). PACAP-27 caused cAMP elevation in NIH/3T3 cells transfected with PAC1 receptors and the increase cAMP caused by pituitary adenylated cyclase (PACAP) was inhibited by (SN)VIPhyb. Also, the increase in cAMP caused by VIP using CHO cells transfected with VPAC1 or VPAC2 receptors was antagonized by (SN)VIPhyb. These results indicate that (SN)VIPhyb is an antagonist for VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1 receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Cloning and functional characterization of a third pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor subtype expressed in insulin-secreting cells.</h2>
                    <h3>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; 1994</h3>
                    <p>Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide belonging to the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/glucagon/secretin family. It is widely distributed in the body, and a variety of biological actions have been reported. PACAP exerts its biological effects by binding to specific receptors that are coupled to GTP-binding proteins. Recent studies have shown that there is a family of PACAP receptors (PACAPRs), and two members of this family have been identified. We report here the cloning, functional expression, and tissue distribution of a third PACAPR subtype, designated PACAPR-3. The cDNA encoding PACAPR-3 has been isolated from a mouse insulin-secreting beta-cell line MIN6 cDNA library. Mouse PACAPR-3 is a protein of 437 amino acids that has 50% and 51% identity with rat PACAP type I and type II receptors, respectively. Expression of recombinant mouse PACAPR-3 in mammalian cells shows that it binds to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide as well as PACAP-38 and -27, with a slightly higher affinity for PACAP-38, and is positively coupled to adenylate cyclase. The expression of PACAPR-3 in Xenopus oocytes indicates that calcium-activated chloride currents are evoked by PACAP and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, suggesting that PACAPR-3 can also be coupled to phospholipase C. RNA blot analysis studies reveal that PACAPR-3 mRNA is expressed at high levels in MIN6, at moderate levels in pancreatic islets and other insulin-secreting cell lines, HIT-T15 and RINm5F, as well as in the lung, brain, stomach, and colon, and at low levels in the heart. Furthermore, insulin secretion from MIN6 cells is significantly stimulated by PACAP-38. These results suggest that the diverse biological effects of PACAP are mediated by a family of structurally related proteins and that PACAPR-3 participates in the regulation of insulin secretion.</p>
