                    <h2>Integrin alpha 8 beta 1 promotes attachment, cell spreading, and neurite outgrowth on fibronectin.</h2>
                    <h3>Molecular biology of the cell; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The integrin alpha 8 subunit, isolated by low stringency hybridization, is a novel integrin subunit that associates with beta 1. To identify ligands, we have prepared a function-blocking antiserum to the extracellular domain of alpha 8, and we have established by transfection K562 cell lines that stably express alpha 8 beta 1 heterodimers on the cell surface. We demonstrate here by cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth assays that alpha 8 beta 1 is a fibronectin receptor. Studies on fibronectin fragments using RGD peptides as inhibitors show that alpha 8 beta 1 binds to the RGD site of fibronectin. In contrast to the endogenous alpha 5 beta 1 fibronectin receptor in K562 cells, alpha 8 beta 1 not only promotes cell attachment but also extensive cell spreading, suggesting functional differences between the two receptors. In chick embryo fibroblasts, alpha 8 beta 1 is localized to focal adhesions. We conclude that alpha 8 beta 1 is a receptor for fibronectin and can promote attachment, cell spreading, and neurite outgrowth on fibronectin.</p>

                    <h2>Localization of beta 1-integrins in human cartilage and their role in chondrocyte adhesion to collagen and fibronectin.</h2>
                    <h3>Experimental cell research; 1993</h3>
                    <p>In the past, proteins have been described that may be involved in chondrocyte interactions with extracellular collagen, but little is known about the role of integrins in chondrocyte-collagen interactions. Here we report on the analysis of beta 1-integrin distribution in human fetal cartilage and on the expression of integrins on fetal chondrocytes, using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to integrin alpha- and beta-chains. We show the presence of alpha 2-, alpha 5-, alpha 6-, alpha v-, and beta 1-chains on freshly isolated chondrocytes by surface immunofluorescence in the fluorescence-activated cell sorter and by surface iodination followed by immunoprecipitation. Affinity chromatography of bovine chondrocyte membrane proteins on a collagen-Sepharose column followed by immunoprecipitation confirmed the presence of the collagen-binding alpha 2 beta 1-integrin on chondrocytes. Chondrocyte adhesion on native collagens I and II, on fibronectin, and on laminin was completely blocked by anti-beta 1; anti-alpha 2 reduced chondrocyte binding to collagen by only 40-50%; similarly, anti-alpha 1-antibodies were also able to reduce chondrocyte binding to collagen, although alpha 1 could not be unequivocally identified on chondrocytes. Chondrocyte adhesion to fibronectin was Mg(2+)- and Ca(2+)-dependent and could be inhibited by anti-alpha 5 and by RGD peptides. Chondrocyte adhesion to native collagens is Mg(2+)-, but not Ca(2+)-dependent and RGD-independent. Interestingly, although these data point to a role of alpha 2 beta 1 in chondrocyte-collagen interactions in vitro, alpha 2 could not be visualized in sections of human fetal cartilage, in contrast to the beta 1-, alpha v-, and alpha 5-chains which were present. This suggests that alpha 2 beta 1-integrin may be involved in the assembly of a pericellular collagen matrix in vitro, but may not be required for chondrocyte-collagen interactions in intact cartilage.</p>

                    <h2>MAdCAM-1 costimulates T cell proliferation exclusively through integrin alpha4beta7, whereas VCAM-1 and CS-1 peptide use alpha4beta1: evidence for "remote" costimulation and induction of hyperresponsiveness to B7 molecules.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of immunology; 1998</h3>
                    <p>We have analyzed the effects of the alpha4 integrin ligands mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and the fibronectin CS-1 splice variant on T cell activation. Immobilized MAdCAM-1 and VCAM-1 IgG-Fc chimeras and a fibronectin CS-1 peptide efficiently costimulate T cell proliferation when antigen presentation is mimicked by anti-CD3 antibody. VCAM-1-Fc and fibronectin CS-1, which are adhesive ligands for both the alpha4beta1 and alpha4beta7 integrins, medicate T cell costimulation exclusively through integrin alpha4beta1, but not through alpha4beta7. The inability of VCAM-1-Fc to costimulate via alpha4beta7 suggests that cell adhesion per se is insufficient, and that exquisite recognition and activation events must be triggered. MAdCAM-1-Fc mediates costimulation exclusively via alpha4beta7, and can both synergize with and induce hyperresponsiveness to the classical costimulator B7-2. MAdCAM-1-Fc and VCAM-1-Fc, but not B7-2, effectively costimulate when immobilized on sites spatially distant from the anti-CD3 antibody ("remote" costimulation). In vitro, the relative potencies of the CAM were VCAM-1-Fc> ICAM-1-Fc> MAdCAM-1-Fc > B7-Fc, except at high concentrations where ICAM-1 was the most potent. Features of costimulatory CAM revealed by this study have important implications for the design of immunotherapeutic vaccine strategies to combat cancer and infection.</p>

                    <h2>Participation of syndecan 2 in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1: structural characteristics of heparan sulfate chains with avidity to COOH-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin.</h2>
                    <h3>Experimental cell research; 2000</h3>
                    <p>The present study provides direct evidence that syndecan 2 participates selectively in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1 through specific binding of its heparan sulfate side chains to the fibronectin substrate. Our previous study with Lewis lung carcinoma-derived P29 cells demonstrated that the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which binds to fibronectin, is syndecan 2 (N. Itano et al., 1996, Biochem. J. 315, 925-930). We here report that in vitro treatment of the cells by antisense oligonucleotide for syndecan 2 resulted in a failure to form stress fibers on fibronectin substrate in association with specific suppression of its cell surface expression. Instead, localization of actin filaments in the cytoplasmic cortex occurred. A similar response of the cells was observed when the cells were treated to eliminate functions of cell surface heparan sulfates, including exogenous addition of heparin and pretreatment with anti-heparan sulfate antibody, F58-10E4, and with proteinase-free heparitinase I. Size- and structure-defined oligosaccharides prepared from heparin and chemically modified heparins were utilized as competitive inhibitors to examine the structural characteristics of the cell surface heparan sulfates involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Their affinity chromatography on a column linked with a recombinant H-271 peptide containing a C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin demonstrated that 2-O-sulfated iduronates were essential for the binding. Inhibition studies revealed that a heparin-derived dodecasaccharide sample enriched with an IdoA(2OS)-GlcNS(6OS) disaccharide completely blocked binding of the syndecan 2 ectodomain to immobilized H-271 peptide. Finally, the dodecasaccharide sample was shown to inhibit stress fiber formation, triggered by adhesion of P29 cells to a CH-271 polypeptide consisting of both the RGD cell-binding and the C-terminal heparin-binding domains of fibronectin in a fused form. All these results consistently suggest that syndecan 2 proteoglycan interacts with the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin at the highly sulfated cluster(s), such as [IdoA(2OS)-GlcNS(6OS)](6) present in its heparan sulfate chains, to result in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1.</p>

                    <h2>Differential induction of gelatinase B (MMP-9) and gelatinase A (MMP-2) in T lymphocytes upon alpha(4)beta(1)-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1 and the CS-1 peptide of fibronectin.</h2>
                    <h3>Experimental cell research; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Integrin alpha(4)beta(1) on the surface of T lymphocytes interacts with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and fibronectin during migration of lymphocytes from the blood to sites of inflammation. Migrating lymphocytes actively modify their environment through a number of mechanisms including proteolysis of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) synthesized by the cells. In this study, expression of MMP upon alpha(4)beta(1)-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to two major ligands, the IIICS-1 domain of fibronectin and VCAM-1, has been examined. Adhesion of T lymphoblastoid Jurkat cells to the CS-1 peptide induced expression of mRNA for two MMPs, gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9). As evaluated by relative RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses, the level of mRNA was upregulated about 4- to 5-fold for both MMPs compared to control cells maintained in suspension. With time, both enzymes were detected in conditioned media and inside the cells, and their identities were verified by Western blotting and gelatin zymography. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the second major alpha(4)beta(1) ligand, VCAM-1, upregulated mRNA for MMP-2 (3.5-fold) and failed to induce expression of mRNA for MMP-9. Accordingly, only MMP-2 protein was detected in conditioned media of cells adherent to VCAM-1. Occupancy of alpha(4)beta(1) on the surface of suspended cells with soluble CS-1 peptide or VCAM-1 did not upregulate synthesis and release of MMPs. A similar pattern of induction of MMPs after adhesion to CS-1 and VCAM-1 was observed in T lymphocytes isolated from human blood. These results demonstrate that adhesion of T lymphocytes through alpha(4)beta(1) to different ligands, which bind to similar or overlapping sites in the integrin, induces intracellular events leading to distinct patterns of MMPs biosynthesis.</p>

                    <h2>Role of the integrin alpha v beta 6 in cell attachment to fibronectin. Heterologous expression of intact and secreted forms of the receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1994</h3>
                    <p>The integrin alpha v beta 6 has been shown to be a fibronectin-binding protein. To determine whether the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of alpha v beta 6 are necessary for binding to fibronectin, a truncated, secreted form of the integrin lacking these domains was engineered and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Fibronectin affinity chromatography demonstrated that the secreted integrin, like its full-length counterpart, was capable of binding fibronectin. Monoclonal antibodies were made to secreted alpha v beta 6 and to beta 6-transfected NIH 3T3 cells. In experiments designed to determine whether alpha v beta 6 can mediate cell attachment to fibronectin, full-length human beta 6 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in the human colon carcinoma cell line SW480. beta 6-expressing cells were identified by alpha v beta 6-specific antibodies, and the beta 6-transfectants were used in cell-adhesion assays. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, human beta 6 associated with hamster alpha v but was incapable of mediating cell attachment to fibronectin. However, expression of beta 6 in these cells had the dominant negative effect of decreasing alpha v beta 5-dependent adhesion to vitronectin. In SW480 cells, beta 6 expression conferred the ability to bind to fibronectin even in the presence of inhibitory antibodies against beta 1 integrins. In such cells, fibronectin binding ability could be blocked by an antibody to alpha v integrins. These results constitute the first direct evidence that alpha v beta 6 mediates cell attachment to fibronectin.</p>
