                    <h2>Cloning and functional expression of cDNAs encoding human and rat pancreatic polypeptide receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; 1996</h3>
                    <p>PCR was used to isolate nucleotide sequences that may encode novel members of the neuropeptide Y receptor family. By use of a PCR product as a hybridization probe, a full-length human cDNA was isolated that encodes a 375-aa protein with a predicted membrane topology identifying it as a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. After stable transfection of the cDNA into human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the receptor exhibited high affinity (Kd = 2.8 nM) for 125I-labeled human pancreatic polypeptide (PP). Competition binding studies in whole cells indicated the following rank order of potency: human PP = bovine PP > or = human [Pro34]peptide YY > rat PP > human peptide YY = human neuropeptide Y. Northern blot analysis revealed that human PP receptor mRNA is most abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and, to a lesser extent, in lung and brain tissue. A rat cDNA clone encoding a high-affinity PP receptor that is 74% identical to the human PP receptor at the amino acid level was also isolated. These receptor clones will be useful in elucidating the functional role of PP and designing selective PP receptor agonists and antagonists.</p>

                    <h2>Cloning of a human receptor of the NPY receptor family with high affinity for pancreatic polypeptide and peptide YY.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptide YY (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) are structurally related peptides found in all higher vertebrates. NPY is expressed exclusively in neurons, whereas PYY and PP are produced primarily in gut endocrine cells. Several receptor subtypes have been identified pharmacologically, but only the NPY/PYY receptor of subtype Y1 has been cloned. This is a heptahelix receptor that couples to G proteins. We utilized Y1 sequence information from several species to clone a novel human receptor with 43% amino acid sequence identity to human Y1 and 53% identity in the transmembrane regions. The novel receptor displays a pharmacological profile that distinguishes it from all previously described NPY family receptors. It binds PP with an affinity (Ki) of 13.8 pM, PYY with 1.44 nM, and NPY with 9.9 nM. Because these data may identify the receptor as primarily a PP receptor, we have named it PP1. In stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells the PP1 receptor inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Northern hybridization detected mRNA in colon, small intestine, pancreas, and prostate. As all three peptides are present in the gut through either endocrine release or innervation, all three peptides may be physiological ligands to the novel NPY family receptor PP1.</p>

                    <h2>Y(4) receptors mediate the inhibitory responses of pancreatic polypeptide in human and mouse colon mucosa.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 2006</h3>
                    <p>The antisecretory effects of several Y agonists, including pancreatic polypeptide (PP), indicate the presence of Y(1), Y(2), and Y(4) receptors in mouse and human (h) colon mucosae. Here, we used preparations from human and from wild-type (WT), Y(4), and Y(1) receptor knockout ((-/-)) mice, alongside Y(4) receptor-transfected cells to define the relative functional contribution of the Y(4) receptor. First, rat (r) PP antisecretory responses were lost in murine Y(4)(-/-) preparations, but hPP and Pro(34) peptide YY (PYY) costimulated Y(4) and Y(1) receptors in WT mucosa. The Y(1) antagonist/Y(4) agonist GR231118 [(Ile,Glu,Pro,Dpr,Tyr,Arg,Leu,Arg,Try-NH(2))-2-cyclic(2,4'),(2',4)-diamide] elicited small Y(4)-mediated antisecretory responses in human tissues pretreated with the Y(1) antagonist, BIBO3304 [(R)-N-[[4-(aminocarbonylaminomethyl)-phenyl]methyl]-N(2)-(diphenylacetyl)-argininamide trifluoroacetate)], and attenuated Y(4)-mediated hPP responses in mouse and human mucosa. GR231118 and rPP were also antisecretory in hY(4)-transfected epithelial monolayers but were partial agonists compared with hPP at this receptor. In Y(4)-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, Y(4) ligands displaced [(125)I]hPP binding with orders of affinity (pK(i)) at human (hPP = rPP > GR231118 > Pro(34)PYY = PYY) and mouse (rPP = hPP > GR231118 > Pro(34)PYY > PYY) Y(4) receptors. GR231118- and rPP-stimulated guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding through hY(4) receptors with significantly lower efficacy than hPP. GR231118 marginally increased basal but abolished further PP-induced hY(4) internalization to recycling (transferrin-labeled) pathways in HEK293 cells. Taken together, these findings show that Y(4) receptors play a definitive role in attenuating colonic anion transport and may be useful targets for novel antidiarrheal agents due to their limited peripheral expression.</p>

                    <h2>Cloning and functional expression of a human Y4 subtype receptor for pancreatic polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, and peptide YY.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The pancreatic polypeptide family includes pancreatic polypeptide (PP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and peptide YY (PYY). Members of the PP family regulate numerous physiological processes, including appetite, gastrointestinal transit, anxiety, and blood pressure. Of the multiple Y-type receptors proposed for PP family members, only the Y1 subtype has been cloned previously. We now report the cloning of an additional Y-type receptor, designated Y4, by homology screening of a human placental genomic library with transmembrane (TM) probes derived from the rat Y1 gene. The Y4 genomic clone encodes a predicted protein of 375 amino acids that is most homologous to Y1 receptors from human, rat, and mouse (42% overall; 55% in TM). 125I-PYY binding to transiently expressed Y4 receptors was saturable (pKd = 9.89) and displaceable by human PP family derivatives: PP (pKi = 10.25) approximately PP2-36 (pKi = 10.06) > PYY (pKi = 9.06) approximately [Leu31,Pro34]NPY (pKi = 8.95) > NPY (pKi = 8.68) > PP13-36 (pKi = 7.13) > PP31-36 (pKi = 6.46) > PP31-36 free acid (pKi < 5). Human PP decreased [cAMP] and increased intracellular [Ca2+] in Y4-transfected LMTK- cells. Y4 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in human brain, coronary artery, and ileum, suggesting potential roles for Y4 receptors in central nervous system, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal function.</p>
