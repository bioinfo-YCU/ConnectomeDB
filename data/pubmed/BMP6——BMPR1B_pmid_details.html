                    <h2>Characterization of bone morphogenetic protein-6 signaling pathways in osteoblast differentiation.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of cell science; 1999</h3>
                    <p>Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-6 is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-(&bgr;) superfamily, and is most similar to BMP-5, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and OP-2/BMP-8. In the present study, we characterized the endogenous BMP-6 signaling pathway during osteoblast differentiation. BMP-6 strongly induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in cells of osteoblast lineage, including C2C12 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells, and ROB-C26 cells. The profile of binding of BMP-6 to type I and type II receptors was similar to that of OP-1/BMP-7 in C2C12 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells; BMP-6 strongly bound to activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-2 (also termed ActR-I), together with type II receptors, i.e. BMP type II receptor (BMPR-II) and activin type II receptor (ActR-II). In addition, BMP-6 weakly bound to BMPR-IA (ALK-3), to which BMP-2 also bound. In contrast, binding of BMP-6 to BMPR-IB (ALK-6), and less efficiently to ALK-2 and BMPR-IA, together with BMPR-II was detected in ROB-C26 cells. Intracellular signalling was further studied using C2C12 and MC3T3-E1 cells. Among the receptor-regulated Smads activated by BMP receptors, BMP-6 strongly induced phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Smad5, and less efficiently those of Smad1. However, Smad8 was constitutively phosphorylated, and no further phosphorylation or nuclear accumulation of Smad8 by BMP-6 was observed. These findings indicate that in the process of differentiation to osteoblasts, BMP-6 binds to ALK-2 as well as other type I receptors, and transduces signals mainly through Smad5 and possibly through Smad1.</p>

                    <h2>Effect of bone morphogenetic protein-6 on haemopoietic stem cells and cytokine production in normal human bone marrow stroma.</h2>
                    <h3>Cell biology international; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Normal human bone marrow stroma cells include stem cells for both haemopoietic and osteochondrogenic lineages and express both bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I and type II receptors. As a member of the TGF-beta super-family, BMP-6 binds to both BMP type I and type II receptors and is involved in the developmental processes of renal and hepatic systems as well as of human foetal intestine. Also, BMP-6 induces osteoblastic differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells and is an autocrine stimulator of chondrocyte differentiation. The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of BMP-6 on human cobblestone-area-forming cells (CAFC), that represent the functional primitive repopulating haemopoietic stem cell in long-term bone marrow culture. Also, the effect of BMP-6 on marrow stroma production of interleukin-6, -11 and their common receptor gp130 that is expressed in haemopoietic stem cells and is indispensable for their proliferation and tri-lineage differentiation was examined. Moreover, the effect of BMP-6 on marrow stroma release of soluble adhesion molecule VCAM-1 mediating the primitive haemopoietic stem cell adhesion to marrow stroma was examined. The number of CAFC was significantly reduced after BMP-6 treatment from 88+/-10 per 10(5)cells in control cultures in a dose dependent manner to only 48+/-3 per 10(5)cells in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated cultures, P< 0.01. Quantitative ELISA measurement revealed 50 ng/ml BMP-6 was able to significantly reduce IL-6 and IL-11 production from marrow stroma, P< 0.01. Also, BMP-6 significantly increased soluble gp130 release by 7.4-fold in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated marrow stroma cultures. The profound rapid increase in this natural antagonist of human IL-6 cytokine family may reduce the gp130 signaling. Also, the soluble VCAM-1 released increased by two-fold in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated marrow stroma cultures. The marked increase in the soluble form may exert an antagonist effect on the function of VCAM-1 (ligand for VLA4). Recently, blocking the VLA4/VCAM-1 adhesion pathway was shown to mobilise haemopoietic CD34 positive cells in normal individuals. Also, we previously observed a significantly lower expression of VLA4 (CD49d) on G-CSF-mobilised blood CD34 positive cells than on bone marrow CD34 positive cells before mobilisation in the same normal donors. Since BMP are currently being used in clinical trials for bone repair and fracture healing, the present results suggest a possible role for BMP-6 in mobilising CD34 positive cells for transplantation. Further in vitro tests are required to evaluate this potential mobilising role of BMP-6 in human long-term bone marrow culture.</p>
