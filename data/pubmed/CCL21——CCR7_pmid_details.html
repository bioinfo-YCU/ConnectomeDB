                    <h2>Roles of SLC/CCL21 and CCR7 in human kidney for mesangial proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and tissue homeostasis.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950); 2002</h3>
                    <p>The release of chemokines by intrinsic renal cells is an important mechanism for the regulation of leukocyte trafficking during renal inflammation. The expression of chemokine receptors by intrinsic renal cells such as mesangial cells (MC) suggests an expanded role for chemokine-chemokine receptor biology in local immunomodulation and potentially glomerular homeostasis. By immunohistochemistry we found the chemokine receptor CCR7 expressed in a mesangial pattern while the CCR7 ligand SLC/CCL21 showed a podocyte-specific expression. CCR7 expression was further characterized by RT-PCR, RNase protection assays, and FACS analysis of cultured human MC, and was found to be constitutively present. Real-time PCR of microdissected glomeruli confirmed the expression of SLC/CCL21. A functional role for CCR7 was demonstrated for human MC migration and proliferation. A protective effect of SLC/CCL21 was shown for MC survival in Fas Ab-induced apoptosis. Finally, "wound healing" was enhanced in the presence of SLC/CCL21 in an in vitro injury model. The constitutive glomerular expression of CCR7 and its ligand SLC/CCL21 in adjacent cell types of the human kidney suggests novel biological functions of this chemokine/chemokine receptor pair and a potential role in processes involved in glomerular homeostasis and regeneration.</p>

                    <h2>Secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine is a functional ligand for the CC chemokine receptor CCR7.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Secondary Lymphoid-tissue Chemokine (SLC) is a recently identified CC chemokine that is constitutively expressed in various lymphoid tissues and is a potent and specific chemoattractant for lymphocytes. The SLC gene and the gene encoding another lymphocyte-specific CC chemokine, EBI1-ligand chemokine (ELC), form a mini-cluster at human chromosome 9p13. Here, we show that SLC is a high affinity functional ligand for chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) that is expressed on T and B lymphocytes and a known receptor for ELC. SLC induced a vigorous calcium mobilization in murine L1.2 cells stably expressing human CCR7. SLC tagged with the secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SLC-SEAP) showed specific binding to CCR7 that was fully competed by SLC with an IC50 of 0.5 nM. SLC also induced a vigorous chemotactic response in CCR7-expressing L1.2 cells with a typical bell-shaped dose-response curve and a maximal migration at 10 nM. When assessed using CCR7-transfected L1.2 cells, SLC and ELC were essentially equivalent in terms of cross desensitization in calcium mobilization via CCR7, cross-competition in binding to CCR7, and induction of chemotaxis via CCR7. SLC and ELC were also shown to fully share receptors expressed on cultured normal T cells known to express CCR7. Notably, however, SLC was somehow less efficient in cross-desensitization against ELC in calcium mobilization and in cross-competition with ELC for binding when assessed using cultured normal T cells. Thus, SLC and ELC, even though sharing only 32% amino acid identity, constitute a genetically and functionally highly related subgroup of CC chemokines.</p>

                    <h2>6-C-kine (SLC), a lymphocyte adhesion-triggering chemokine expressed by high endothelium, is an agonist for the MIP-3beta receptor CCR7.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of cell biology; 1998</h3>
                    <p>The beta chemokine known as 6-C-kine, secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine (SLC), TCA4, or Exodus-2 (herein referred to as 6CK/SLC) can trigger rapid integrin-dependent arrest of lymphocytes rolling under physiological shear and is highly expressed by high endothelial venules, specialized vessels involved in lymphocyte homing from the blood into lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. We show that 6CK/SLC is an agonist for the lymphocyte chemoattractant receptor, CCR7 (EBI-1, BLR-2), previously described as a receptor for the related beta chemokine MIP-3beta (ELC or Exodus-3). Moreover, 6CK/SLC and MIP-3beta attract the same major populations of circulating lymphocytes, including naive and memory T cells > B cells (but not natural killer cells); desensitization to MIP-3beta inhibits lymphocyte chemotaxis to 6CK/SLC but not to the alpha chemokine SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor); and 6CK/SLC competes for MIP-3beta binding to resting mouse lymphocytes. The findings suggest that the majority of circulating lymphocytes respond to 6CK/SLC and MIP-3beta in large part through their common receptor CCR7 and that these molecules may be important mediators of physiological lymphocyte recirculation in vivo.</p>
