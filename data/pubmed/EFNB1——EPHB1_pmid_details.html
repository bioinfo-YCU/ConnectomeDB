                    <h2>The Eph family of receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Current opinion in cell biology; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Eph receptor tyrosine kinases have recently been identified as instructive molecules that guide the topographic movement of cells and growth cones. The activation of Eph receptors by their ligands, which are membrane-anchored molecules, involves a cell-cell recognition event that often causes cell repulsion. Therefore, Eph receptors mediate signals that can override cell adhesion. Transmembrane ligands for Eph receptors also exhibit properties of signal transducing molecules, suggesting that bidirectional signaling occurs when receptor-expressing cells contact ligand-expressing cells.</p>

                    <h2>The kinase-null EphB6 receptor undergoes transphosphorylation in a complex with EphB1.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Uniquely for the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases, the EphB6 receptor is catalytically inactive due to the alteration of several critical residues in its kinase domain. This has cast doubt upon its ability to participate in cytoplasmic signaling events. We show here that despite its lack of kinase activity, EphB6 undergoes inducible tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation with the Eph-B receptor subfamily ligand ephrin-B1. We also demonstrate, for the first time, evidence of cross-talk between Eph receptors. Overexpression of a catalytically active member of the Eph-B subfamily, EphB1, resulted in increased EphB6 phosphorylation. EphB1-induced EphB6 phosphorylation was ligand-dependent and required the functional catalytic activity of EphB1. EphB1 not only transphosphorylated EphB6, but together they also formed a stable hetero-complex. In addition, we identify the proto-oncogene c-Cbl as an EphB6-binding protein. Although EphB6-Cbl association appeared to be constitutive, Cbl required a functional phosphotyrosine binding domain in order to bind the receptor, whereas its RING finger motif ubiquitin-transfer domain was not necessary. Our findings demonstrate that EphB6 is an actively signaling receptor that undergoes transphosphorylation upon ligand binding and that can initiate specific cytoplasmic signaling events.</p>

                    <h2>Nck-interacting Ste20 kinase couples Eph receptors to c-Jun N-terminal kinase and integrin activation.</h2>
                    <h3>Molecular and cellular biology; 2000</h3>
                    <p>The mammalian Ste20 kinase Nck-interacting kinase (NIK) specifically activates the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase module. NIK also binds the SH3 domains of the SH2/SH3 adapter protein Nck. To determine whether Nck functions as an adapter to couple NIK to a receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, we determined whether NIK is activated by Eph receptors (EphR). EphRs constitute the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), and members of this family play important roles in patterning of the nervous and vascular systems. In this report, we show that NIK kinase activity is specifically increased in cells stimulated by two EphRs, EphB1 and EphB2. EphB1 kinase activity and phosphorylation of a juxtamembrane tyrosine (Y594), conserved in all Eph receptors, are both critical for NIK activation by EphB1. Although pY594 in the EphB1R has previously been shown to bind the SH2 domain of Nck, we found that stimulation of EphB1 and EphB2 led predominantly to a complex between NIK/Nck, p62(dok), RasGAP, and an unidentified 145-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p62(dok) most probably binds directly to the SH2 domain of Nck and RasGAP and indirectly to NIK bound to the SH3 domain of Nck. We found that NIK activation is also critical for coupling EphB1R to biological responses that include the activation of integrins and JNK by EphB1. Taken together, these findings support a model in which the recruitment of the Ste20 kinase NIK to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins by Nck is an important proximal step in the signaling cascade downstream of EphRs.</p>

                    <h2>EphB1 associates with Grb7 and regulates cell migration.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2002</h3>
                    <p>EphB1 is a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases that play important roles in diverse biological processes including nervous system development, angiogenesis, and neural synapsis formation and maturation. Grb7 is an adaptor molecule implicated in the regulation of cell migration. Here we report identification of an interaction between Grb7 and the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 by using Grb7 as a "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid screening. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to confirm the interaction of Grb7 with the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 as well as the full-length receptor in intact cells. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of Grb7 and requires tyrosine autophosphorylation of EphB1. Furthermore, Tyr-928 of EphB1 was identified as the primary binding site for Grb7. Stimulation of endogenous EphB1 in embryonal carcinoma P19 cells with its ligand ephrinB1 increased its association with Grb7, which is consistent with a role for the autophosphorylation of EphB1. We also found that EphB1 could phosphorylate Grb7 and mutation of either Tyr-928 or Tyr-594 to Phe decreased this activity. Finally, we show that EphB1 could stimulate fibroblast motility on extracellular matrix in a kinase-dependent manner, which also correlated with its association with Grb7. Consistent with this, co-expression of Grb7 with EphB1 further enhanced cell motility, whereas co-expression of the Grb7 SH2 domain abolished EphB1-stimulated cell migration. Together, our results identified a novel interaction between EphB1 with the adaptor molecule Grb7 and suggested that this interaction may play a role in the regulation of cell migration by EphB1.</p>
