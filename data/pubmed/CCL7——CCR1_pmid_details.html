                    <h2>Monocyte chemotactic protein-2 (MCP-2) uses CCR1 and CCR2B as its functional receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-2 is a member of the C-C chemokine subfamily, which shares more than 60% sequence homology with MCP-1 and MCP-3 and about 30% homology with macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, regulated on activation of normal T cell expressed (RANTES), and MIP-1beta. Despite this considerable sequence homology to other C-C chemokines, MCP-2 appears to have unique functional properties in comparison with other C-C chemokines such as MCP-1 and MCP-3. Although evidence obtained from studies on leukocytes suggested that MCP-2 may share the receptors with these C-C chemokines, the actual functional receptors for MCP-2 have not yet been identified. In this study, by using radioiodinated MCP-2, we identified high affinity binding sites for MCP-2 on human peripheral blood monocytes. The MCP-2 binding was competed for by MCP-1 and MCP-3, but less well by MIP-1alpha or RANTES. In experiments using cells transfected with C-C chemokine receptors, 125I-MCP-2 bound to human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with CCR1 or CCR2B, known to also bind MIP-1alpha/RANTES and MCP-1, respectively, but both shared by MCP-3. The binding of 125I-MCP-2 to these receptor-transfected cells was displaced completely by chemokines that bind to these receptors. Both CCR1- and CCR2B-transfected 293 cells showed significant migration in response to MCP-2, in addition to responding to other specific chemokines. These results clearly demonstrate that MCP-2, unlike MCP-1, uses both CCR1 as well as CCR2B as its functional receptors, and this accounts for the unique activities of MCP-2.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological characterization of the chemokine receptor, hCCR1 in a stable transfectant and differentiated HL-60 cells: antagonism of hCCR1 activation by MIP-1beta.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>C-C chemokine receptor-1 (CCR1) has been implicated in mediating a variety of inflammatory conditions including multiple sclerosis and organ rejection. Although originally referred to as the MIP-1alpha/RANTES receptor, CCR1 is quite promiscuous and can be activated by numerous chemokines. We used radioligand binding and [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays in membranes from a cell line transfected to express CCR1 (Ba/F3-hCCR1) to characterize a panel of chemokines (HCC-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MIP-1delta, MPIF-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and RANTES) as CCR1 ligands. In this recombinant model, these chemokines displaced 125I-MIP-1alpha with a wide range of potencies and, with the exception of MCP-2, acted as full agonists in stimulating [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange. We then assessed the utility of HL-60 cells cultured with known differentiating agents (PMA, DMSO, dibutyryl-cAMP or retinoic acid) for investigating CCR1 pharmacology. In [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, membranes from cells cultured with retinoic acid (4-6 days) were the most responsive to activation by MIP-1alpha and MPIF-1. FACS analysis and comparative pharmacology confirmed that these activities were mediated by CCR1. Using [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, intracellular calcium flux and/or whole cell chemotaxis assays in HL-60(Rx) cells, we validated that MIP-1alpha was the most potent CCR1 ligand (MIP-1alpha>MPIF-1>RANTES>or=MIP-1beta) although the ligands differed in their efficacy as agonists. MPIF-1 was the more efficacious (MPIF-1>RANTES=MIP-1alpha>>MIP-1beta). 125I-MIP-1beta binding in Ba/F3-hCCR1 and HL-60(Rx) membranes was competitively displaced by MIP-1alpha, MPIF-1 and MIP-1beta. The binding K(i) for these chemokines with 125I-MIP-1beta were essentially identical in the two membrane systems. Lastly, MIP-1beta antagonized [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange, Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis in HL-60(Rx) cells in response to robust agonists such as MIP-1alpha, RANTES and MPIF-1. Based on our results, we propose that MIP-1beta could function as an endogenous inhibitor of CCR1 function.</p>

                    <h2>Study of the HIV-1 receptors CD4, CXCR4, CCR5 and CCR3 in the human and rat testis.</h2>
                    <h3>Molecular human reproduction; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Sexual transmission of HIV is one of the main routes of transmission of AIDS. Despite the fact that the virus has been found in the semen and germ cells of patients with HIV, little is known about how the virus infects the cells of the genital tract. We studied the cellular distribution of CD4, a receptor necessary for HIV infection, and the major HIV co-receptors CCR3, CCR5 and CXCR4 in the rat and human testis. We used RT-PCR, Northern blotting and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that CCR3 is absent from the testes of both species, whereas CCR5 and CXCR4 are present on the resident testicular macrophages in the interstitial space but not in the germ cell line. All of the human testicular macrophages expressed the markers CD45 and MAC387 and most also expressed CD4. Thus, our data suggest that macrophages in the testis may be infected by HIV and that these macrophages may be a site of early viral localization and a potential HIV reservoir. This may in turn alter the activity of Leydig cells and subsequently affect spermatogenesis.</p>

                    <h2>Monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 is a functional ligand for CC chemokine receptors 1 and 2B.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The CC chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3) activates human monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. MCP-3 has been reported to induce [Ca2+]i changes in cells transfected with the monocyte-selective MCP-1 receptor 2B (CC CKR2B) and competes for 125I-MCP-1 binding on CC CKR2B, suggesting that it may mediate monocyte responses to MCP-3. However, we now show that MCP-3 is a ligand and potent agonist for the macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha)/regulated on activation, normal T expressed, and secreted protein (RANTES) receptor CC CKR1 (rank order for [Ca2+]i changes = MIP-1 alpha > MCP-3 > RANTES), which is expressed in monocytes > neutrophils > eosinophils. 125I-MCP-3 bound directly to CC CKR1 and CC CKR2B (Ki = 8 and 7 nM, respectively). Binding to CC CKR1 was competed by all CC chemokines tested except MCP-1. In contrast, binding to CC CKR2B was competed only by MCP-3 and MCP-1. Both MCP-1 and MCP-3 were equipotent agonists (EC50 = 10 nM for [Ca2+]i changes). Thus, MCP-3 is a functional ligand for both CC CKR1 and CC CKR2B, which otherwise have distinct selectivities for CC chemokines. These data suggest that monocyte responses to MCP-3 could be mediated by both CC CKR2B and CC CKR1, whereas eosinophil responses to MCP-3 could be mediated by CC CKR1.</p>

                    <h2>Monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP3) interacts with multiple leukocyte receptors. C-C CKR1, a receptor for macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha/Rantes, is also a functional receptor for MCP3.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP3) is recently identified and molecularly cloned C-C chemokine that is chemotactic for and activates a great variety of inflammatory cell types. MCP3 has been reported to interact with several C-C chemokine receptors, which can be simultaneously or selectively expressed on leukocyte subpopulations. In order to isolate receptor(s) for MCP3, a cDNA library was constructed using mRNA from a human NK-like cell line, YT. These cells showed high affinity binding sites for 125I-MCP3 and migrated in response to MCP3. A chemokine receptor cDNA clone, designated YT4, was sequenced and found to be identical to the known C-C CKR1 or macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP1 alpha)/Rantes receptor. YT4 cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, and stable transfectants were prepared using the embryonic kidney cell line 293. The transfectants (YT4/293) showed high affinity binding for 125I-MCP3 in addition to specifically binding 125I-MIP1 alpha and 125I-Rantes. All three C-C chemokines were able to cross-compete for binding sites on YT4/293 cells and induced directional migration of YT4/293 cells in vitro, with MCP3 being the most potent chemoattractant. MCP3, MIP1 alpha, and Rantes were equally able to cross-attenuate the migratory response of YT4/293 cells to one another. In contrast, MCP1 and MIP1 beta had very limited capacity to compete for MCP3 binding on YT4/293 cells and had only a minor attenuating effect on MCP3-induced migration. Since MCP3 has been reported to use MCP1 receptor(s), our results with transfected 293 cells expressing only C-C CKR1 clearly establish that C-C CKR1 is also a functional receptor for MCP3.</p>
