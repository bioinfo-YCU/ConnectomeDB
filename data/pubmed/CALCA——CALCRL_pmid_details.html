                    <p>Calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin are related peptides with distinct pharmacological profiles.

RAMPs are required to transport CRLR to the plasma membrane. RAMP1 presents the receptor at the cell surface as a mature glycoprotein and a CGRP receptor.

                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide with diverse biological effects including potent vasodilator activity. We report here the cloning of a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding a human CGRP1 receptor, which shares significant peptide sequence homology with the human calcitonin receptor, a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Northern blot analysis revealed that the messenger RNA for this receptor is predominantly expressed in the lung and heart. In situ studies showed specific localization of the receptor mRNA to alveolar cells in the lung and to cardiac myocytes in the heart. Stable expression of the cDNA in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells produced specific, high affinity binding sites for CGRP that displayed pharmacological and functional properties very similar to native human CGRP1 receptor. Exposure of these cells to CGRP resulted in a 60-fold increase in cAMP production, which was inhibited in a competitive manner by the CGRP1 receptor antagonist, CGRP-(8-37).</p>

                    <h2>Female sex steroid hormones and pregnancy regulate receptors for calcitonin gene-related peptide in rat mesenteric arteries, but not in aorta.</h2>
                    <h3>Biology of reproduction; 2004</h3>
                    <p>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator neuropeptide known to be involved in the regulation of vascular tone. Results of previous studies from our laboratory and others suggest that vascular sensitivity to CGRP is enhanced during pregnancy and that the female sex steroid hormones estradiol-17beta (E2) and progesterone (P4) may be involved in this process. We hypothesized that CGRP receptors in the mesenteric artery are increased during pregnancy and with sex steroid hormone treatments. In the present study, we investigated whether pregnancy and female sex steroid hormones modulate the CGRP-receptors CGRP-A and CGRP-B in the mesenteric artery in the rat. The CGRP-A receptor consists of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1); however, the CGRP-B receptor needs to be further characterized. Messenger RNA levels for CRLR and RAMP1 were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and CGRP-B receptor proteins levels were determined by Western blot analysis. In addition, [125I]CGRP binding was measured by Scatchard analysis. Both mRNA for CGRP-A (CRLR and RAMP1) and the protein for CGRP-B receptors in mesenteric arteries were increased with pregnancy compared to nonpregnant, diestrous animals. A P4 antagonist, RU-486, downregulated and P4 upregulated these receptors in mesenteric arteries (P < 0.05) in pregnant rats. In adult ovariectomized rats, P4 upregulated CRLR and RAMP1 mRNA levels as well as [125I]CGRP-binding sites. The CGRP-B-receptor protein levels were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated by P4 and by combined E2 and P4 treatment. Together with earlier findings, these data suggest that increases in the expression of CGRP-A (CRLR and RAMP1) and CGRP-B receptors in mesenteric arteries may be important in reducing vascular resistance and in vascular adaptations that occur during pregnancy; in addition, P4 may be involved in this process.</p>

                    <h2>Autoradiographic distribution of 125I calcitonin gene-related peptide binding sites in the rat central nervous system.</h2>
                    <h3>Peptides; 1985</h3>
                    <p>Using autoradiographic method and 125I-Tyro rat CGRP as a ligand, receptor binding sites were demonstrated in the rat central nervous system. Saturation studies and Scatchard analysis of CGRP-binding to slide mounted tissue sections containing primarily cerebellum showed a single class of receptors with a dissociation constant of 0.96 nM and a Bmax of 76.4 fmol/mg protein. 125I-Tyro rat CGRP binding sites were demonstrated throughout the rat central nervous system. Dense binding was observed in the telencephalon (medial prefrontal, insular and outer layers of the temporal cortex, nucleus accumbens, fundus striatum, central and inferior lateral amygdaloid nuclei, most caudal caudate putamen, organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, subfornical organ), the diencephalon (anterior hypothalamic, suprachiasmatic, arcuate, paraventricular, dorsomedial, periventricular, reuniens, rhomboid, lateral thalamic pretectalis and habenula nuclei, zona incerta), in the mesencephalon (superficial layers of the superior colliculus, central nucleus of the geniculate body, inferior colliculus, nucleus of the fifth nerve, locus coeruleus, nucleus of the mesencephalic tract, the dorsal tegmental nucleus, superior olive), in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, in the medulla oblongata (inferior olive, nucleus tractus solitarii, nucleus commissuralis, nuclei of the tenth and twelfth nerves, the prepositus hypoglossal and the gracilis nuclei, dorsomedial part of the spinal trigeminal tract), in the dorsal gray matter of the spinal cord (laminae I-VI) and the confines of the central canal. Moderate receptor densities were found in the septal area, the "head" of the anterior caudate nucleus, medial amygdaloid and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the pyramidal layers of the hippocampus and dentate gyri, medial preoptic area, ventromedial nucleus, lateral hypothalamic and ventrolateral thalamic area, central gray, reticular part of the substantia nigra, parvocellular reticular nucleus. Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract and gracile fasciculus of the spinal cord. The discrete distribution of CGRP-like binding sites in a variety of sensory systems of the brain and spinal cord as well as in thalamic and hypothalamic areas suggests a widespread involvement of CGRP in a variety of brain functions.</p>

                    <h2>The transmembrane domain of receptor-activity-modifying protein 1 is essential for the functional expression of a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemistry; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Three receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMP) define specific interactions between calcitonin (CT) gene-related peptide (CGRP), adrenomedullin (AM) and amylin, and a CT receptor or a CT receptor-like receptor (CRLR). Both form heterodimeric RAMP/receptor complexes at the cell surface. This association represents a novel principle of G protein-coupled receptor function. RAMP1 is transported to the cell surface together with the CRLR or the CT receptor. Here, we have investigated the functional relevance of the short C-terminal intracellular tail QSKRTEGIV and of the single transmembrane domain of human (h) RAMP1 for their interactions with the hCRLR to constitute a CGRP receptor. To this end, hRAMP1 has been sequentially truncated from the C-terminus, and [(125)I]h alpha CGRP/hRAMP1/hCRLR association at the cell surface and cAMP accumulation in response to h alpha CGRP have been examined. With the C-terminal truncation of hRAMP1 by four amino acids wild-type hRAMP1 function was maintained, and the hCRLR was required for the transport of hRAMP1 to the cell surface. Further truncation of hRAMP1 through removal of the remaining five intracellular amino acids revealed CRLR-independent cell surface delivery but otherwise normal hRAMP1 activity. Sequential shortening of the hRAMP1 transmembrane domain resulted in progressively impaired association with the hCRLR and, as a consequence, abolished CGRP receptor function. In conclusion, the intracellular QSKRT sequence adjacent to the transmembrane domain of hRAMP1 provides a signal for intracellular retention. The sequence is unrelated to consensus endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval motives and overridden by the presence of the hCRLR. The entire single transmembrane domain of hRAMP1 together with one hydrophilic amino acid residue at its C-terminus is required for the formation of a fully functional CGRP/hRAMP1/hCRLR receptor complex.</p>
