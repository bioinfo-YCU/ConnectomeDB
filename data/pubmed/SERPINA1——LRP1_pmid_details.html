                    <h2>Cellular internalization and degradation of antithrombin III-thrombin, heparin cofactor II-thrombin, and alpha 1-antitrypsin-trypsin complexes is mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>The inhibition of proteinase activity by members of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) family is a critical regulatory mechanism for a variety of biological processes. Once formed, the serpin enzyme complexes (SECs) are removed from the circulation by a hepatic receptor. The present study suggests that this receptor is very likely the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a prominent liver receptor. In vitro binding studies revealed that antithrombin III (ATIII)-thrombin, heparin cofactor II (HCII)-thrombin, and alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT)-trypsin bound to purified LRP, and their binding was inhibited by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist of LRP-ligand binding activity. In contrast, native or modified forms of the inhibitors were unable to bind to LRP. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which express LRP, mediate the cellular internalization leading to degradation of these SECs, while mouse fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP showed no capacity to internalize and degrade these complexes. SECs were also degraded by HepG2 cells, and this process was inhibited by LRP antibodies, RAP, and chloroquine. The cellular-mediated uptake and degradation was specific for SECs; native or modified forms of the inhibitors were not internalized and degraded. Finally, in vivo clearance studies in rats demonstrated that RAP inhibited the clearance of ATIII-125I-thrombin complexes from the circulation. Together, these results indicate that LRP functions as a liver receptor responsible for the plasma clearance of SECs.</p>

                    <h2>Mutants of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 designed to inhibit neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are more effective in vivo than their endogenous inhibitors.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2004</h3>
                    <p>Neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are abundant intracellular neutrophil proteinases that have an important role in destroying ingested particles. However, when neutrophils degranulate, these proteinases are released and can cause irreparable damage by degrading host connective tissue proteins. Despite abundant endogenous inhibitors, these proteinases are protected from inhibition because of their ability to bind to anionic surfaces. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), which is not an inhibitor of these proteinases, possesses properties that could make it an effective inhibitor of neutrophil proteinases if its specificity could be redirected. PAI-1 efficiently inhibits surface-sequestered proteinases, and it efficiently mediates rapid cellular clearance of PAI-1-proteinase complexes. Therefore, we examined whether PAI-1 could be engineered to inhibit and clear neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. By introducing specific mutations in the reactive center loop of wild-type PAI-1, we generated PAI-1 mutants that are effective inhibitors of both proteinases. Kinetic analysis shows that the inhibition of neutrophil proteinases by these PAI-1 mutants is not affected by the sequestration of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G onto surfaces. In addition, complexes of these proteinases and PAI-1 mutants are endocytosed and degraded by lung epithelial cells more efficiently than either the neutrophil proteinases alone or in complex with their physiological inhibitors, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor and alpha1-antichymotrypsin. Finally, the PAI-1 mutants were more effective in reducing the neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G activities in an in vivo model of lung inflammation than were their physiological inhibitors.</p>
