                    <h2>Chemokine receptor usage by human eosinophils. The importance of CCR3 demonstrated using an antagonistic monoclonal antibody.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of clinical investigation; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Chemokines bind and signal through G-protein coupled seven transmembrane receptors. Various chemokine receptors are expressed on leukocytes, and these may impart selective homing of leukocyte subsets to sites of inflammation. Human eosinophils express the eotaxin receptor, CCR3, but respond to a variety of CC chemokines apart from eotaxin, including RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-2, MCP-3, and MCP-4. Here we describe a mAb, 7B11, that is selective for CCR3 and has the properties of a true receptor antagonist. 7B11 blocked binding of various radiolabeled chemokines to either CCR3 transfectants, or eosinophils. Pretreatment of eosinophils with this mAb blocked chemotaxis and calcium flux induced by all CCR3 ligands. In all individuals examined, including allergic and eosinophilic donors, > 95% of the response of eosinophils to eotaxin, RANTES, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MCP-4 was shown to be mediated through CCR3. The IL-8 receptors, particularly CXCR2, were induced on IL-5 primed eosinophils, however these eosinophils responded to CC chemokines in the same manner as unprimed eosinophils. These results demonstrate the importance of CCR3 for eosinophil responses, and the feasibility of completely antagonizing this receptor.</p>

                    <h2>High expression of the chemokine receptor CCR3 in human blood basophils. Role in activation by eotaxin, MCP-4, and other chemokines.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of clinical investigation; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Eosinophil leukocytes express high numbers of the chemokine receptor CCR3 which binds eotaxin, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-4, and some other CC chemokines. In this paper we show that CCR3 is also highly expressed on human blood basophils, as indicated by Northern blotting and flow cytometry, and mediates mainly chemotaxis. Eotaxin and MCP-4 elicited basophil migration in vitro with similar efficacy as regulated upon activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) and MCP-3. They also induced the release of histamine and leukotrienes in IL-3-primed basophils, but their efficacy was lower than that of MCP-1 and MCP-3, which were the most potent stimuli of exocytosis. Pretreatment of the basophils with a CCR3-blocking antibody abrogated the migration induced by eotaxin, RANTES, and by low to optimal concentrations of MCP-4, but decreased only minimally the response to MCP-3. The CCR3-blocking antibody also affected exocytosis: it abrogated histamine and leukotriene release induced by eotaxin, and partially inhibited the response to RANTES and MCP-4. In contrast, the antibody did not affect the responses induced by MCP-1, MCP-3, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, which may depend on CCR1 and CCR2, two additional receptors detected by Northern blotting with basophil RNA. This study demonstrates that CCR3 is the major receptor for eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-4 in human basophils, and suggests that basophils and eosinophils, which are the characteristic effector cells of allergic inflammation, depend largely on CCR3 for migration towards different chemokines into inflamed tissues.</p>

                    <h2>A novel, selective, and orally available antagonist for CC chemokine receptor 3.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 2006</h3>
                    <p>CC chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11/eotaxin) and other CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) ligands (CCL24/eotaxin-2, CCL26/eotaxin-3, CCL13/monocyte chemotactic protein-4, etc.) play important roles in the chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils and other CCR3-expressing cells (basophils, mast cells, and CD4(+) T helper 2 cells) in allergic inflammation incidents, including asthma and rhinitis. A newly synthesized compound, N-{(3R)-1-[(6-fluoro-2-naphthyl)methyl]pyrrolidin-3-yl}-2-{1-[(5-hydroxy-3-methylpyridin-2-yl)carbonyl]piperidin-4-ylidene}-acetamide hemifumarate (YM-355179), inhibited the binding of CCL11 and CCL5/regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted to CCR3-expressing B300-19 cells with IC(50) values of 7.6 and 24 nM, respectively. In contrast, YM-355179 did not affect the binding of CCL5 to CCR1 or CCR5. In functional assays, YM-355179 inhibited CCL11-induced, intracellular Ca(2+) influx, chemotaxis, and eosinophil degranulation with IC(50) values of 8.0, 24, and 29 nM, respectively. YM-355179 did not, however, affect any CC chemokine receptor (CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, or CCR5)-mediated Ca(2+) influx signals. Furthermore, oral administration of YM-355179 (1 mg/kg) inhibited CCL11-induced shape change of whole blood eosinophils in cynomolgus monkeys. Intravenous injection of YM-355179 (1 mg/kg) also inhibited eosinophil infiltration into airways of cynomolgus monkeys after segmental bronchoprovocation with CCL11. These results indicate that YM-355179 is a novel, selective, and orally available CCR3 antagonist with therapeutic potential for treating eosinophil-related allergic inflammatory diseases.</p>

                    <h2>Matrix metalloproteinase processing of monocyte chemoattractant proteins generates CC chemokine receptor antagonists with anti-inflammatory properties in vivo.</h2>
                    <h3>Blood; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-3 is inactivated upon cleavage by the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gelatinase A (MMP-2). We investigated the susceptibility to proteolytic processing of the 4 human MCPs by 8 recombinant MMPs to determine whether MCP-3 is an isolated example or represents a general susceptibility of chemokines to proteolytic inactivation by these important inflammatory proteases. In addition to MMP-2, MCP-3 is efficiently cleaved by membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP, the cellular activator of MMP-2, and by collagenase-1 and collagenase-3 (MMP-1, MMP-13) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3). Specificity was shown by absence of cleavage by matrilysin (MMP-7) and the leukocytic MMPs neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) and gelatinase B (MMP-9). The closely related chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-4 were not cleaved by MMP-2 or MT1-MMP, but were cleaved by MMP-1 and MMP-3 with varying efficiency. MCPs were typically cleaved between residues 4 and 5, but MCP-4 was further processed at Val7-Pro8. Synthetic MCP analogs corresponding to the MMP-cleaved forms bound CC chemokine receptor (CCR)-2 and CCR-3, but lacked chemoattractant activity in pre-B cells transfected with CCR-2 and CCR-3 or in THP-1 monocytic cells, a transformed leukemic cell line. Moreover, the truncated products of MCP-2 and MCP-4, like MCP-3, were potent antagonists of their cognate CC chemokine receptors in transwell cell migration assays in vitro. When they were injected 24 hours after the initiation of carrageenan-induced inflammation in rat paws, their in vivo antagonist activities were revealed by a greater than 66% reduction in inflammatory edema progression after 12 hours. We propose that MMPs have an important role in modulating inflammatory and immune responses by processing chemokines in wound healing and in disease.</p>
