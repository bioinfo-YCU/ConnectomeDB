                    <h2>The T cell-directed CC chemokine TARC is a highly specific biological ligand for CC chemokine receptor 4.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) is a recently identified CC chemokine that is expressed constitutively in thymus and transiently in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. TARC functions as a selective chemoattractant for T cells that express a class of receptors binding TARC with high affinity and specificity. To identify the receptor for TARC, we produced TARC as a fusion protein with secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and used it for specific binding. By stably transfecting five orphan receptors and five known CC chemokine receptors (CCR1 to -5) into K562 cells, we found that TARC-SEAP bound selectively to cells expressing CCR4. TARC-SEAP also bound to K562 cells stably expressing CCR4 with a high affinity (Kd = 0.5 nM). Only TARC and not five other CC chemokines (MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted), MIP-1alpha (macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha), MIP-1beta, and LARC (liver and activation-regulated chemokine)) competed with TARC-SEAP for binding to CCR4. TARC but not RANTES or MIP-1alpha induced migration and calcium mobilization in 293/EBNA-1 cells stably expressing CCR4. K562 cells stably expressing CCR4 also responded to TARC in a calcium mobilization assay. Northern blot analysis revealed that CCR4 mRNA was expressed strongly in human T cell lines and peripheral blood T cells but not in B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, or granulocytes. Taken together, TARC is a specific functional ligand for CCR4, and CCR4 is the specific receptor for TARC selectively expressed on T cells.</p>

                    <h2>Macrophage-derived chemokine is a functional ligand for the CC chemokine receptor 4.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) is a recently identified member of the CC chemokine family. MDC is not closely related to other chemokines, sharing most similarity with thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), which contains 37% identical amino acids. Both chemokines are highly expressed in the thymus, with little expression seen in other tissues. In addition, the genes for MDC and TARC are encoded by human chromosome 16. To explore this relationship in greater detail, we have more precisely localized the MDC gene to chromosome 16q13, the same position reported for the TARC gene. We have also examined the interaction of MDC with CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), recently shown to be a receptor for TARC. Using a fusion protein of MDC with secreted alkaline phosphatase, we observed high affinity binding of MDC-secreted alkaline phosphatase to CCR4-transfected L1.2 cells (Kd = 0.18 nM). MDC and TARC competed for binding to CCR4, while no binding competition was observed for six other chemokines (MCP-1, MCP-3, MCP-4, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta). MDC was tested for calcium mobilization in L1.2 cells tranfected with seven different CC chemokine receptors. MDC induced a calcium flux in CCR4-transfected cells, but other receptors did not respond to MDC. TARC, which also induced calcium mobilization in CCR4 transfectants, was unable to desensitize the response to MDC. In contrast, MDC fully desensitized a subsequent response to TARC. Both MDC and TARC functioned as chemoattractants for CCR4 transfectants, confirming that MDC is also a functional ligand for CCR4. Since MDC and TARC are both expressed in the thymus, one role for these chemokines may be to attract CCR4-bearing thymocytes in the process of T cell education and differentiation.</p>
