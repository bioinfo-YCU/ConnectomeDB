                    <h2>Phospholipase C activation by neurotensin and neuromedin N in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the rat neurotensin receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Brain research. Molecular brain research; 1992</h3>
                    <p>The rat neurotensin receptor cDNA sequence was transfected in Chinese hamster ovary cells and cellular clones which stably express the corresponding protein were isolated and characterized. The Scatchard analysis of the specific binding of [3H]neurotensin indicated a Kd value of 0.45 +/- 0.08 nM and a Bmax value of 3.27 +/- 0.29 pmol/mg of protein. Displacement experiments using peptidic analogs of neurotensin and levocabastine confirmed that the transfected receptor exhibits the binding properties of the neurotensin receptor characterized in the rat brain. Neurotensin stimulated the phosphoinositides hydrolysis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and this effect was mimicked by neurotensin(8-13) and by neuromedin N. The stimulation of phosphoinositides hydrolysis was not inhibited by pertussis toxin. These results indicate that the transfected cells actively express the rat neurotensin receptor which is functionally coupled to phospholipase C through a pertussis toxin-insensitive GTP-binding protein, and that neuromedin N is able to induce the phosphoinositides turnover by interaction with the neurotensin receptor.</p>

                    <h3>Neuron; 1990</h3>
                    <p>A functional cDNA clone for the rat neurotensin receptor was isolated by combining molecular cloning in an RNA expression vector with an electrophysiological assay in Xenopus oocytes. The neurotensin receptor consists of 424 amino acids with seven putative transmembrane domains and belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. The cloned receptor expressed in mammalian cells or in Xenopus oocytes shows a selective and high-affinity binding to neurotensin peptides and undergoes potent desensitization by repeated application of neurotensin. The neurotensin receptor mRNA is expressed in both the brain and the peripheral tissues at different levels. This investigation discloses the molecular nature of the neurotensin receptor, which mediates the diverse neuronal and peripheral actions of neurotensin by effecting the G protein-associated second messenger system.</p>

                    <h2>Production of recombinant large proneurotensin/neuromedin N-derived peptides and characterization of their binding and biological activity.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical and biophysical research communications; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Proneurotensin/neuromedin N (pro-NT/NN) is the common precursor of two biologically active related peptides, neuromedin N (NN) and neurotensin (NT). It undergoes a tissue-specific processing leading to the formation in some tissues and cancer cell lines of large peptides ending with the NT (large NT) or NN (large NN) sequence. In this study, we prepared and purified high amounts of recombinant large NT and large NN using the Drosophila S2 cell expression system. The binding and pharmacological properties of recombinant large peptides were characterized and compared to those of NT and NN using either COS cells transfected with the human subtype-1 NT receptor (hNTS1) or the human colon adenocarcinoma HT29 cell line that endogenously expresses hNTS1. Furthermore, the metabolic stability of the large peptides, when exposed to HT29 cells, was compared to that of NT and NN. Both large NT and large NN were able to bind to and activate hNTS1 with potencies that were approximately 10 times lower than that of their small counterpart. In addition, the large forms proved to be far less sensitive to degradation than the small peptides. Taken together, these data suggest that the large forms might represent endogenous, long-lasting activators of hNTS1 in a number of physiopathological situations.</p>

                    <h2>Agonism, inverse agonism, and neutral antagonism at the constitutively active human neurotensin receptor 2.</h2>
                    <h3>Molecular pharmacology; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Two G protein-coupled neurotensin (NT) receptors, termed NTR1 and NTR2, have been identified so far. In contrast to the NTR1, which has been extensively studied, little is known about the pharmacological and biological properties of the NTR2. In the course of characterizing NT analogs that exhibited binding selectivity for the NTR2, we discovered that this receptor constitutively activated inositol phosphate (IP) production. Here, we report on the constitutive activity of the human NTR2 (hNTR2) transfected in COS cells and on compounds that exhibit agonism, inverse agonism, and neutral antagonism at this receptor. IP levels increased linearly with time, whereas they remained constant in mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, IP production was proportional to the amount of hNTR2 present at the cell membrane. SR 48692, a nonpeptide antagonist of the NTR1, stimulated IP production, whereas levocabastine, a nonpeptide histamine H1 antagonist that binds the NTR2 but not the NTR1, behaved as a weak partial inverse agonist. NT analogs modified at position 11 of the NT molecule, in particular by the introduction of bulky aromatic D amino acids, exhibited binding selectivity at the hNTR2 and also behaved as partial inverse agonists, reversing constitutive IP production up to 50%. Finally, NT barely affected constitutive IP production but antagonized the effects of both agonist and inverse agonist compounds, thus behaving as a neutral antagonist. The unique pharmacological profile of the hNTR2 is discussed in the light of its sequence similarity with the NTR1 and the known binding site topology of NT and SR 48692 in the NTR1.</p>

                    <h2>A single amino acid of the human and rat neurotensin receptors (subtype 1) determining the pharmacological profile of a species-selective neurotensin agonist.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical pharmacology; 2000</h3>
                    <p>The neurotensin (NT) receptor, subtype 1 (NTR1), is a 7-transmembrane-spanning receptor, forming 3 extracellular and 3 intracellular loops. Previously, we showed that the third outer loop (E3) is the binding site for NT and its analogs, several of which bind with higher affinity to rat NTR1 (rNTR1) than to human NTR1 (hNTR1). In particular, NT34 [3,1'-naphthyl-l-Ala(11)]NT(8-13) has greater than 60-fold higher affinity for rNTR1 (46 and 60 pM for transiently- and stably-transfected cells, respectively) than for hNTR1 (2.8 and 5.8 nM for transiently- and stably-transfected cells, respectively) isolated from transfected cell membranes. Previously, our molecular modeling studies of rNTR1 and hNTR1 showed that the binding pocket in the human receptor for NT34 is smaller in volume from the bulky residue Tyr(339) in the pocket center, as compared with the corresponding residue Phe(344) in the rat binding pocket. Therefore, with site-directed mutagenesis, we derived mutant forms of rNTR1(F344Y) and hNTR1(Y339F). Examination of the mutant receptors from membranal preparations of transfected cells in radioligand binding assays and with intact cells in functional assays (phosphatidyl-4,5-bisphosphate turnover) showed that the human-like rat receptor and the rat-like human receptor bound NT34 with a predicted reverse of binding compared with its binding to the wild-type receptors. These results strongly affirm our molecular modeling studies and demonstrate the importance of the study of even minor structural variations in proteins to determine the basis of significantly different drug responses, an area of focus for pharmacological research in the 21st century.</p>

                    <h2>Neurotensin induces mating in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells that express human neurotensin receptor type 1 in place of the endogenous pheromone receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of biochemistry; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Heterologous expression of the human neurotensin receptor type I (hNT1-R) has been achieved in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Immunoanalysis of membranes prepared from cells expressing a c-myc-tagged version of hNT1-R revealed multiple c-myc cross-reacting polypeptides of high molecular mass, suggesting that hNT1-R was glycosylated in yeast. High-affinity binding sites for 125I-labeled-[monoiodo-Tyr3]neurotensin ([125I-Tyr3]NT) were detected on hNT1-R-expressing cells with Kd and Bmax values of 3.2 nM and of 500 receptors per cell, respectively. Competition binding studies of neurotensin with SR142948 and SR48692, two nonpeptidic antagonists of hNT1-R, indicated that the yeast-produced recombinant receptor displayed the same pharmacological properties as hNT1-R expressed in mammalian cells. Interestingly, neurotensin activated the pheromone pathway in hNT1-R-expressing cells in a dose-dependent fashion, as revealed by a beta-galactosidase activity assay with a pheromone-responsive Fus1:lacZ construct. Mutational inactivation of the SST2 and STE2 genes increased the level of beta-galactosidase activity in response to neurotensin by twofold. Recombinant hNT1-R-producing cells, which lacked the endogenous G-protein-coupled receptor for the alpha pheromone, mated with wild-type MATalpha haploid cells in response to neurotensin, leading to bona fide diploid zygote formation. This is the first report of a mammalian receptor that can replace the endogenous pheromone receptor when produced in yeast, by signaling a fully effective, agonist-induced, mating process.</p>

                    <h2>A novel form of neurotensin post-translationally modified by arginylation.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2005</h3>
                    <p>A novel bioactive form of neurotensin post-translationally modified at a Glu residue was isolated from porcine intestine. Purification of the peptide was guided by detection of intracellular Ca2+ release in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. Using high resolution accurate mass analysis on an ion trap Fourier transform mass spectrometer, the post-translational modification was identified as arginine linked to the gamma-carboxyl of Glu via an isopeptide bond, and we named the newly identified peptide "arginylated neurotensin" (R-NT, N-(neurotensin-C5-4-yl)arginine). Although arginylation is a known modification of N-terminal amino groups in proteins, its presence at a Glu side chain is unique. The finding places neurotensin among the few physiologically active peptides that occur both in post-translationally modified and unmodified forms. Pharmacologically, we characterized R-NT for its ligand activity on three known neurotensin receptors, NTR1, -2, and -3, and found that R-NT has similar pharmacological properties to those of neurotensin, however, with a slightly higher affinity to all three receptors. We expressed the intracellular receptor NTR3 as a soluble protein secreted into the cell culture medium, which allowed characterization of its R-NT and neurotensin binding properties. The creation of soluble NTR3 also provides a potential tool for neutralizing neurotensin action in vivo and in vitro. We have shown that SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells express NTR1 and NTR3 but not NTR2, suggesting that the Ca2+ mobilization elicited by R-NT is via NTR1.</p>
