                    <h2>Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1999</h3>
                    <p>Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.</p>

                    <h2>High level expression, activation, and antagonism of CC chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells.</h2>
                    <h3>Cytokine; 2004</h3>
                    <p>The specificity of leukocyte trafficking in inflammation is controlled by the interactions of chemokines with chemokine receptors. Reliable structure-function studies of chemokine-receptor interactions would benefit from cell lines that express consistent high levels of chemokine receptors. We describe herein two new Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines in which the genes for chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR3 have been incorporated into identical positions in the host genome. CCR2 is the primary receptor for the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) whereas CCR3 is the primary receptor for the chemokines eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3. Both receptors are expressed at >5,000,000 copies per cell, substantially higher levels than in previous cell lines, and both are competent for binding and activation by the cognate chemokines for these receptors. Using these cell lines we confirm that eotaxin-1 and eotaxin-3 can act as an agonist and an antagonist, respectively, of CCR2. In addition, we show that eotaxin-2 is an antagonist of CCR2 and MCP-1 is an agonist of CCR3. Comparison of the chemokine sequences reveals several positions that are identical in MCP-1 and eotaxin-1 but different in eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3, suggesting that these amino acids play a role in CCR2 activation.</p>

                    <h2>A novel, selective, and orally available antagonist for CC chemokine receptor 3.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 2006</h3>
                    <p>CC chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11/eotaxin) and other CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) ligands (CCL24/eotaxin-2, CCL26/eotaxin-3, CCL13/monocyte chemotactic protein-4, etc.) play important roles in the chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils and other CCR3-expressing cells (basophils, mast cells, and CD4(+) T helper 2 cells) in allergic inflammation incidents, including asthma and rhinitis. A newly synthesized compound, N-{(3R)-1-[(6-fluoro-2-naphthyl)methyl]pyrrolidin-3-yl}-2-{1-[(5-hydroxy-3-methylpyridin-2-yl)carbonyl]piperidin-4-ylidene}-acetamide hemifumarate (YM-355179), inhibited the binding of CCL11 and CCL5/regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted to CCR3-expressing B300-19 cells with IC(50) values of 7.6 and 24 nM, respectively. In contrast, YM-355179 did not affect the binding of CCL5 to CCR1 or CCR5. In functional assays, YM-355179 inhibited CCL11-induced, intracellular Ca(2+) influx, chemotaxis, and eosinophil degranulation with IC(50) values of 8.0, 24, and 29 nM, respectively. YM-355179 did not, however, affect any CC chemokine receptor (CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, or CCR5)-mediated Ca(2+) influx signals. Furthermore, oral administration of YM-355179 (1 mg/kg) inhibited CCL11-induced shape change of whole blood eosinophils in cynomolgus monkeys. Intravenous injection of YM-355179 (1 mg/kg) also inhibited eosinophil infiltration into airways of cynomolgus monkeys after segmental bronchoprovocation with CCL11. These results indicate that YM-355179 is a novel, selective, and orally available CCR3 antagonist with therapeutic potential for treating eosinophil-related allergic inflammatory diseases.</p>
