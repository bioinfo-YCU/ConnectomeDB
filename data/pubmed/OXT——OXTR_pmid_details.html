                    <h2>Structure and expression of a human oxytocin receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature; 1992</h3>
                    <p>Just before the onset of labour, uterine myometrium becomes extremely sensitive to oxytocin, for which it is a primary target tissue, because of a dramatic increase in the number of oxytocin receptors. We report here the structure and expression of the human oxytocin receptor complementary DNA isolated by expression cloning. The encoded receptor is a 388-amino-acid polypeptide with 7 transmembrane domains typical of G protein-coupled receptors. The oxytocin receptor, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, specifically responds to oxytocin and induces an inward membrane current. Messenger RNAs for the receptor are of two sizes, 3.6 kilobases in breast, and 4.4 kilobases in ovary, uterine endometrium and myometrium. The mRNA level in the myometrium is very high at term. We conclude that the increase in receptor number in the myometrium at labour is, at least in part, due to the increase in mRNA.</p>

                    <h2>Tyr115 is the key residue for determining agonist selectivity in the V1a vasopressin receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The EMBO journal; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Using a three-dimensional model of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), we have previously succeeded in docking the neurohypophysial hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) into the V1a receptor. According to this model, the hormone is completely embedded in the transmembrane part of the receptor. Only the side chain of the Arg residue at position 8 projects outside the transmembrane core of the receptor and possibly interacts with a Tyr residue located in the first extracellular loop at position 115. Residue 8 varies in the two natural neurohypophysial hormones, AVP and oxytocin (OT); similarly, different residues are present at position 115 in the different members of the AVP/OT receptor family. Here we show that Arg8 is crucial for high affinity binding of AVP to the rat V1a receptor. Moreover, when Tyr115 is replaced by an Asp and a Phe, the amino acids naturally occurring in the V2 and in the OT receptor subtypes, the agonist selectivity of the V1a receptor switches accordingly. Our results indicate that the interaction between peptide residue 8 and the receptor residue at position 115 is not only crucial for agonist high affinity binding but also for receptor selectivity.</p>

                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 2003</h3>
                    <p>We have discovered a new, potent, selective, and orally active oxytocin receptor antagonist, (2S,4Z)-N-[(2S)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl]-4-(methoxyimino)-1-[(2'-methyl[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)carbonyl]-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamide (compound 1). We report the biochemical, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic characterization in vitro and in vivo of this compound. Compound 1 competitively inhibits binding of [3H]oxytocin and the peptide antagonist 125I-ornithine vasotocin analog to human and rat oxytocin receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA or Chinese hamster ovary cells with nanomolar potency. Selectivity against vasopressin receptor subtypes is >6-fold for V1a and >350-fold for V2 and V1b. Compound 1 inhibits oxytocin-evoked intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (IC50 = 8 nM). Compound 1 has no intrinsic agonist activity at the oxytocin receptor. Oxytocininduced contraction of isolated rat uterine strips is blocked by compound 1 (pA2 = 7.82). In anesthetized nonpregnant rats, single administration of compound 1 by i.v. or oral routes causes dose-dependent inhibition of contractions elicited by repeated injections of oxytocin with ED50 = 3.5 mg/kg i.v. and 89 mg/kg p.o., respectively. Compound 1 significantly inhibits spontaneous uterine contractions in pregnant rats near term when administered intravenously or orally. We conclude that compound 1 is a potent, selective, and orally active nonpeptide oxytocin receptor antagonist, which is a suitable candidate for evaluation as a potential tocolytic agent for the management of preterm labor.</p>

                    <h2>Selectivity of d[Cha4]AVP and SSR149415 at human vasopressin and oxytocin receptors: evidence that SSR149415 is a mixed vasopressin V1b/oxytocin receptor antagonist.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2005</h3>
                    <p>1 A possible role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1b) receptor subtype in stress-related disorders has been recently highlighted by the discovery of the agonist [1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] AVP (d[Cha(4)]AVP) and the antagonist SSR149415. Both compounds have been proposed to target specifically V(1b) receptors, since the reported affinities for the related V(1a), V(2) and oxytocin receptors are in the micromolar or submicromolar range. In the present study, we further investigated the binding affinities of d[Cha(4)]AVP and SSR149415 at recombinant human vasopressin V(1b) (hV(1b)) and oxytocin (hOT) receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and functional properties of both compounds at hV(1b), hV(1a), hV(2) and hOT receptors. 2 d[Cha(4)]AVP bound to hV(1b) receptors and hOT receptors with pK(i) values of 9.68+/-0.06 and 7.68+/-0.09, respectively. SSR149415 showed pK(i) values of 9.34+/-0.06 at hV(1b) and 8.82+/-0.16 at hOT receptors. 3 d[Cha(4)]AVP stimulated [Ca(2+)](i) increase in hV(1b)-CHO cells with a pEC(50) value of 10.05+/-0.15. It showed pEC(50) values of 6.53+/-0.17 and 5.92+/-0.02 at hV(1a) and hV(2) receptors, respectively, and behaved as a weak antagonist at hOT receptors (pK(B)=6.31+/-0.12). SSR149415 inhibited the agonist-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase with pK(B) values of 9.19+/-0.07 in hV(1b)-CHO and 8.72+/-0.15 in hOT-CHO cells. A functional pK(i) value of 7.23+/-0.10 was found for SSR1494151 at hV(1a) receptors, whereas it did not inhibit 20 nM AVP response at hV(2) receptors up to 3 microM. 4 Data obtained confirmed the high potency and selectivity of d[Cha(4)]AVP at hV(1b) receptors, but revealed that SSR149415, in addition to the high potency at hV(1b) receptors, displays a significant antagonism at hOT receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of the human oxytocin receptor stably expressed in 293 human embryonic kidney cells.</h2>
                    <h3>Life sciences; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The human oxytocin (OT) receptor was stably expressed in 293 embryonic kidney cells (293/OTR), characterized pharmacologically and compared to human uterine myometrial receptors. The cloned receptor is expressed at a reasonably high density (0.82 fmole/microgram protein) and exhibits high affinity for [3H]OT (Kd = 0.32nM), similar to the value found in human myometrial tissue. The rank-order of potency for various antagonist and agonist ligands from several structural classes is also similar between the cloned and native receptor, as seen in a comparison of their inhibitory constants for [3H]OT binding. Agonist affinity at the cloned OT receptor is decreased by guanine nucleotide analogs, demonstrating functional G-protein-coupling. The OT receptor in 293 cells, like in human myometrium, is also coupled to the inositol phosphate pathway. In 293/OTR cells, OT stimulates inositol phosphate accumulation with an EC50 = 4.1 nM, an effect blocked by a potent and selective OT antagonist, L-366,948. Additionally, the cloned receptor in 293 cells desensitizes to high concentrations of OT, similar to the desensitization in myometrial tissue and also described for several other G-protein-coupled receptors. These results illustrate the utility of the 293 cell line for expressing human OT receptors in an environment quite comparable to the native myometrial tissue.</p>

                    <h2>Two aromatic residues regulate the response of the human oxytocin receptor to the partial agonist arginine vasopressin.</h2>
                    <h3>FEBS letters; 1996</h3>
                    <p>We investigated the mechanisms that regulate the efficacy of agonists in the arginine-vasopressin (AVP)/oxytocin (OT) receptor system. In this paper, we present evidence that AVP, a full agonist of the vasopressin receptors, acts as a partial agonist on the oxytocin receptor. We also found that AVP becomes a full agonist when two aromatic residues of the oxytocin receptor are replaced by the residues present at equivalent positions in the vasopressin receptor subtypes. Our results indicate that these two residues modulate the response of the oxytocin receptor to the partial agonist AVP.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular modeling of the oxytocin receptor/bioligand interactions.</h2>
                    <h3>Acta biochimica Polonica; 1999</h3>
                    <p>Oxytocin is a nonapeptide hormone (CYIQNCPLG-NH2, OT), controlling labor and lactation in mammalian females, via interactions with specific cellular membrane receptors (OTRs). The native hormone is cyclized via a 1-6 disulfide and its receptor belongs to the GTP-binding (G) protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, also known as heptahelical transmembrane (7TM) or serpentine receptors. Using a technique combining multiple sequence alignments with available experimental constraints, a reliable OTR model was built. Subsequently, the OTR complexes with a selective agonist [Thr4,Gly7]OT, a selective cyclohexapeptide antagonist L-366,948 and oxytocin itself were modeled and relaxed using a constrained simulated annealing (CSA) protocol. All three ligands seem to prefer similar modes of binding to the receptor, manifested by repeating receptor residues which directly interact with the ligands. Those involved in the three complexes are putative helices: TM3: R113, K116, Q119, M123; TM4: Q171, and TM5: I201 and T205. Most of them are the equivalent residues/positions to those found in our earlier studies, regarding related vasopressin V2 receptor/bioligand interactions.</p>
