                    <h3>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; 1994</h3>
                    <p>A full-length cDNA encoding the guinea pig kappa opioid (dynorphin) receptor has been isolated. The deduced protein contains 380 aa and seven hydrophobic alpha-helices characteristic of the G protein-coupled receptors. This receptor is 90% identical to the mouse and rat kappa receptors, with the greatest level of divergence in the N-terminal region. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the receptor displays high affinity and stereospecificity toward dynorphin peptides and other kappa-selective opioid ligands such as U50, 488. It does not bind the mu- and delta-selective opioid ligands. The expressed receptor is functionally coupled to G protein(s) to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and Ca2+ channels. The guinea pig kappa receptor mRNA is expressed in many brain areas, including the cerebellum, a pattern that agrees well with autoradiographic maps of classical guinea pig kappa binding sites. Species differences in the pharmacology and mRNA distribution between the cloned guinea pig and rat kappa receptors may be worthy of further examination.</p>

                    <h2>Cloning of a human kappa opioid receptor from the brain.</h2>
                    <h3>Life sciences; 1995</h3>
                    <p>By using a rat kappa opioid receptor cDNA as a probe to screen a human brain cDNA library, we isolated a 4.0-kb clone (z115) which encompasses a major portion of a human kappa opioid receptor (hkor), extending from the amino acid residue #6 to the 3'-untranslated region. The extreme 5'-region 232-bp fragment of z115 was used as a probe to screen a human genomic DNA library. A 1.6-kb fragment (d2) of one positive clone was found to extend from 5'-untranslated region to beyond the exon/intron junction at residue Arg86. The genomic DNA fragment d2 and the cDNA clone z115 were assembled to generate a clone (d2-z115) containing the entire coding sequence of hkor. Clone d2-z115 has an open reading frame of 1140 bp, which encodes for a 380-amino acid protein. The deduced amino acid sequence has 93.9% and 93.2% identity to rat and mouse kappa receptors, respectively. It also displays approximately 60% identity to both human mu and delta receptors. Northern blot analysis showed that in the human brain there was a single hkor mRNA transcript of 6.0 kb. Among brain regions examined, the amygdala, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus and subthalamic nucleus contained high levels of hkor mRNA. Hkor was cloned into the expression vector pBK-CMV and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. Hkor had high affinity for [3H] diprenorphine, a nonselective opioid antagonist, and displayed stereospecific binding to naloxone. kappa selective ligands (U50,488H and nor-BNI) had high affinities, whereas mu and delta selective ligands bound with much lower affinities. Dynorphin A (1-17) and alpha-neoendorphin, both endogenous kappa peptides, bound with high affinities. These binding characteristics confirmed that hkor is a kappa receptor, most likely kappa 1 type. Cloning of the human kappa receptor allows investigation of interactions of compounds with the human receptor, instead of rodent receptors, for development of better therapeutic agents.</p>

                    <h2>kappa-Opioid receptor in humans: cDNA and genomic cloning, chromosomal assignment, functional expression, pharmacology, and expression pattern in the central nervous system.</h2>
                    <h3>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Using the mouse delta-opioid receptor cDNA as a probe, we have isolated genomic clones encoding the human mu- and kappa-opioid receptor genes. Their organization appears similar to that of the human delta receptor gene, with exon-intron boundaries located after putative transmembrane domains 1 and 4. The kappa gene was mapped at position q11-12 in human chromosome 8. A full-length cDNA encoding the human kappa-opioid receptor has been isolated. The cloned receptor expressed in COS cells presents a typical kappa 1 pharmacological profile and is negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. The expression of kappa-opioid receptor mRNA in human brain, as estimated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, is consistent with the involvement of kappa-opioid receptors in pain perception, neuroendocrine physiology, affective behavior, and cognition. In situ hybridization studies performed on human fetal spinal cord demonstrate the presence of the transcript specifically in lamina II of the dorsal horn. Some divergences in structural, pharmacological, and anatomical properties are noted between the cloned human and rodent receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Activation of the cloned human kappa opioid receptor by agonists enhances [35S]GTPgammaS binding to membranes: determination of potencies and efficacies of ligands.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Activation of kappa receptors inhibits adenylate cyclase, enhances K+ conductance and reduces Ca++ conductance via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. We recently cloned a human kappa opioid receptor and stably expressed it in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In this study, the effects of activation of the human kappa receptor by agonists on [35S]GTPgammaS binding to CHO cell membranes were examined. The presence of GDP and Mg++ was essential for the kappa agonist (-)-U50,488H-induced increase in [35S]GTPgammaS binding to be observed and the optimal concentration was 3 microM and 5 mM, respectively. The presence of 100 mM Na+ was necessary to produce the maximal signal-to-background ratio. (-)U50,488H-induced increase in [35S]GTPgammaS binding was time- and tissue concentration-dependent. (-)U50,488H increased [35S]GTPgammaS binding in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 3.1 nM. (+)-U50,488H had no effect, which indicates that this effect is stereospecific. Naloxone (1 microM) or norbinaltorphimine (10 nM) shifted the dose-response curve of (-)-U50,488H to the right by 100-fold. These results indicate that enhancement of [35S]GTPgammaS binding by (-)-U50,488H is a kappa receptor-mediated event. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, but not cholera toxin, abolished the (-)-U50,488H-induced increase in [35S]GTPgammaS binding, which indicates the involvement of Gi and/or Go proteins. [35S]GTPgammaS binding induced by (-)-U50,488H had a Kd value of 0.34 +/- 0.08 nM and a Bmax value of 431 +/- 29 fmol/mg protein. The rank order of potencies of opioid ligands tested in stimulating [35S]GTPgammaS binding was dynorphin A 1-17 > (+/-)-ethylketocyclazocine > beta-funaltrexamine, (-)-U50,488H, tifluadom > nalorphine > pentazocine, nalbuphine > buprenorphine. Dynorphin A 1-17, (+/-)-ethylketocyclazocine, (-)-U50,488H, tifluadom and beta-funaltrexamine were full agonists, but nalorphine and pentazocine were partial agonists producing maximal responses of 68% and 23% of those of full agonists, respectively. Nalbuphine and buprenorphine had low levels of agonist activities. Norbinaltorphimine and naloxone were antagonists devoid of activities. Enhancement of [35S]GTPgammaS binding by kappa agonists provides a simple functional measure for receptor activation and can be used for determination of potencies and efficacies of opioid ligands at the kappa receptor.</p>

                    <h2>Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of dynorphin A-(1-8) amide analogues.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of medicinal chemistry; 1990</h3>
                    <p>In order to study the structure-activity relationships of dynorphin A-(1-8) amide [Dyn(1-8)-NH2], 20 analogues were synthesized by the solution method. Their biological activities were determined in the three bioassays [guinea pig ileum (GPI), mouse vas deferens (MVD), and rabbit vas deferens (RVD)] and in the mouse tail-pinch test after intravenous administration. Some analogues that showed interesting activity in the bioassays and/or in the analgesic tests were further characterized in mu-, delta-, and kappa-representative binding assays. The obtained data indicate that modification of the enkephalin segment to give metabolically stable analogues with high affinity and selectivity for the kappa receptor is strictly limited and that introduction of MeArg in position 7 protects the Arg6-Arg-7 bond from enzymatic degradation without potency drop and change of opioid receptor selectivity. [MeTyr1,MeArg7,D-Leu8]Dyn(1-8)-NHEt (18) [IC50 (nM) = 0.3 (GPI), 7.4 (MVD), and 2.6 (RVD); tail pinch ED50 (mg/kg) = 0.75] showed opioid activity similar to that of dynorphin A in the three bioassays and relatively high kappa-receptor selectivity in the binding assays and produced a 2.5-fold more potent analgesic effect than morphine. [D-Cys2-Cys5,MeArg7,D-Leu8]Dyn(1-8)-NHEt (20) showed a 40-60-fold more potent opioid activity than 18 in the three bioassays and produced a 3.4-fold more potent analgesic effect than 18. In the binding assays, however, 20 showed higher affinity for mu and delta receptors than for the kappa receptor.</p>
