                    <h2>MAdCAM-1 costimulates T cell proliferation exclusively through integrin alpha4beta7, whereas VCAM-1 and CS-1 peptide use alpha4beta1: evidence for "remote" costimulation and induction of hyperresponsiveness to B7 molecules.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of immunology; 1998</h3>
                    <p>We have analyzed the effects of the alpha4 integrin ligands mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and the fibronectin CS-1 splice variant on T cell activation. Immobilized MAdCAM-1 and VCAM-1 IgG-Fc chimeras and a fibronectin CS-1 peptide efficiently costimulate T cell proliferation when antigen presentation is mimicked by anti-CD3 antibody. VCAM-1-Fc and fibronectin CS-1, which are adhesive ligands for both the alpha4beta1 and alpha4beta7 integrins, medicate T cell costimulation exclusively through integrin alpha4beta1, but not through alpha4beta7. The inability of VCAM-1-Fc to costimulate via alpha4beta7 suggests that cell adhesion per se is insufficient, and that exquisite recognition and activation events must be triggered. MAdCAM-1-Fc mediates costimulation exclusively via alpha4beta7, and can both synergize with and induce hyperresponsiveness to the classical costimulator B7-2. MAdCAM-1-Fc and VCAM-1-Fc, but not B7-2, effectively costimulate when immobilized on sites spatially distant from the anti-CD3 antibody ("remote" costimulation). In vitro, the relative potencies of the CAM were VCAM-1-Fc> ICAM-1-Fc> MAdCAM-1-Fc > B7-Fc, except at high concentrations where ICAM-1 was the most potent. Features of costimulatory CAM revealed by this study have important implications for the design of immunotherapeutic vaccine strategies to combat cancer and infection.</p>

                    <h2>Differential induction of gelatinase B (MMP-9) and gelatinase A (MMP-2) in T lymphocytes upon alpha(4)beta(1)-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1 and the CS-1 peptide of fibronectin.</h2>
                    <h3>Experimental cell research; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Integrin alpha(4)beta(1) on the surface of T lymphocytes interacts with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and fibronectin during migration of lymphocytes from the blood to sites of inflammation. Migrating lymphocytes actively modify their environment through a number of mechanisms including proteolysis of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) synthesized by the cells. In this study, expression of MMP upon alpha(4)beta(1)-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to two major ligands, the IIICS-1 domain of fibronectin and VCAM-1, has been examined. Adhesion of T lymphoblastoid Jurkat cells to the CS-1 peptide induced expression of mRNA for two MMPs, gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9). As evaluated by relative RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses, the level of mRNA was upregulated about 4- to 5-fold for both MMPs compared to control cells maintained in suspension. With time, both enzymes were detected in conditioned media and inside the cells, and their identities were verified by Western blotting and gelatin zymography. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the second major alpha(4)beta(1) ligand, VCAM-1, upregulated mRNA for MMP-2 (3.5-fold) and failed to induce expression of mRNA for MMP-9. Accordingly, only MMP-2 protein was detected in conditioned media of cells adherent to VCAM-1. Occupancy of alpha(4)beta(1) on the surface of suspended cells with soluble CS-1 peptide or VCAM-1 did not upregulate synthesis and release of MMPs. A similar pattern of induction of MMPs after adhesion to CS-1 and VCAM-1 was observed in T lymphocytes isolated from human blood. These results demonstrate that adhesion of T lymphocytes through alpha(4)beta(1) to different ligands, which bind to similar or overlapping sites in the integrin, induces intracellular events leading to distinct patterns of MMPs biosynthesis.</p>

                    <h2>The alpha 4 beta 1 fibronectin ligands CS-1, Hep II, and RGD induce different intracellular events in B lymphoid cells. Comparison with the effects of the endothelial ligand VCAM-1.</h2>
                    <h3>Cell adhesion and communication; 1996</h3>
                    <p>The lymphocyte integrin alpha 4 beta 1 is the receptor for the Hep II domain and CS-1 site in fibronectin (Fn) as well as for VCAM-1. We recently showed that upon activation with anti-beta 1 mAb TS2/16, alpha 4 beta 1 also recognizes the RGD Fn sequence. To determine the physiological role of these multiple interactions, we have now studied some intracellular events induced by "resting" and activated alpha 4 beta 1 binding to its different ligands. Analyses of actin and tubulin reorganization upon adhesion of B lymphoid cells to Fn fragments or VCAM-1 showed that VCAM-1, a 38 kDa fragment (Hep II+CS-1), and the CS-1 synthetic peptide induced formation of transient cytoplasmic projections; however, cells attached to a 58 kDa (Hep II) or 80 kDa (RGD) fragments remained rounded. Using transfilter assays, we showed that VCAM-1, 38 kDa and CS-1 also induced dose-dependent B cell migration mediated by alpha 4 beta 1. Furthermore, these three ligands, but not the 80 kDa fragment or a synthetic peptide (H1) containing a sequence from Hep II shown to bind alpha 4 beta 1, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 110 kDa protein. Activation of alpha 4 beta 1 with TS2/16 inhibited the cytoplasmic protrusions and cell migration but did not affect the pattern of phosphorylation. Our results indicate that the various alpha 4 beta 1 ligands induce different cellular responses. Most importantly they show that alpha 4 beta 1 interaction with CS-1 is sufficient to trigger intracellular events in B cells. Furthermore, they suggest a regulation by the activation form of the receptor as well as by the ligand in events involving lymphocyte adhesion and migration.</p>
