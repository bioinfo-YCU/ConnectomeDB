                    <h2>Characterization of tachykinin NK2 receptor in the anterior pituitary gland.</h2>
                    <h3>Life sciences; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Tachykinins are a family of bioactive peptides that interact with three subtypes of receptors: NK1, NK2 and NK3. Substance P has greater affinity for NK1, and neurokinin A (NKA) for NK2 receptor subtype. Although only NK1 receptor has been characterized in the anterior pituitary gland, some evidence suggests the existence of NK2 receptors in this gland. Therefore, we investigated the presence of NK2 receptors in the anterior pituitary gland of male rats by radioligand binding studies using labeled SR48968, a non peptidic specific antagonist. [3H]SR48968 specific binding to cultured anterior pituitary cells was time-dependent and saturable, but with a lower affinity than previously reported values for cells expressing NK2 receptors. Unlabeled NKA inhibited only partially [(3)H]SR48968 specific binding to whole anterior pituitary cells. Since SR48968 is a non polar molecule, we performed experiments to discriminate surface from intracellular binding sites. SR48968 exhibited both surface and intracellular specific binding. Analysis of the surface-bound ligand indicated that [3H]SR48968 binds to one class of receptor with high affinity. Neurokinin A completely displaced [3H]SR48968 surface specific binding fitting to a two-site/two-state model with high and low affinity. Additionally, immunocytochemical studies showed that the NK2 receptor is expressed at least in a subset of lactotropes. These results demonstrate the presence of NK2 receptors in the anterior pituitary gland and suggest that NKA actions in this gland are mediated, at least in part, by the NK2 receptor subtype.</p>

                    <h2>The ligand binding site of the neurokinin 2 receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis and identification of neurokinin A binding residues in the human neurokinin 2 receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1994</h3>
                    <p>Thirteen residues in the human neurokinin 2 (NK2) receptor were identified as potential ligand-binding residues by molecular modeling and amino acid sequence analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter these residues in order to ascertain their importance in binding neurokinin A (NKA), the physiological peptide ligand for the NK2 receptor, and the non-peptide NK2 receptor selective antagonist SR48968. Four sites appear to be critical for NKA binding (Gln109, His198, Ile202, and Gly273). The mutant receptors Gln109-->His, Ile202-->Val, Gly273-->Pro, and Gly273-->Thr maintain their affinity for SR48968, despite being unable to bind the peptide ligand. His198-->Ala and His198-->Leu no longer bind NKA or SR48968. We have also identified a residue (Leu292) which appears to play a minor role in the binding of substance P (SP) and neurokinin B (NKB) to the NK2 receptor. The mutant receptor Leu292-->Ser binds NKB and SP with approximately a 5-fold greater affinity in comparison with the wild type receptor while the affinity of NKA remains unaffected. The results suggest that intramembranous residues, as well as residues which lie close to the extracellular side of transmembrane helices 3, 5, and 6, form part of the NK2 receptor binding site. Binding of SP and NKB to the NK2 receptor may also be influenced by residues near the extracellular side of helix 7. These results suggest that some regions of the binding site for NKA in the NK2 receptor are not used for binding SP in the NK1 receptor. However, it also seems that the NKA binding site includes regions that are also used by other G-protein-coupled receptors such as rhodopsin and the beta 2-adrenergic receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological profile of the novel mammalian tachykinin, hemokinin 1.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>1. The effects of the novel mammalian tachykinin, hemokinin 1 (HEK-1), have been investigated by radioligand binding and functional in vitro and in vivo experiments. 2. Similar to SP (K(i)=0.13 nM), HEK-1 inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner and with high affinity [(3)H]-substance P (SP) binding to human NK(1) receptor (K(i)=0.175 nM) while its affinity for [(125)I]-neurokinin A (NKA) binding at human NK(2) receptor was markedly lower (K(i)=560 nM). 3. In isolated bioassays HEK-1 was a full agonist at tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptors. In the rat urinary bladder (RUB) HEK-1 was about 3 fold less potent than SP. In the rabbit pulmonary artery (RPA) HEK-1 and in the guinea-pig ileum (GPI), HEK-1 was about 500 fold less potent than NKA and NKB, respectively. 4. The responses to HEK-1 were antagonized by GR 82334 in RUB (pK(B)=5.6+/-0.07), by nepadutant in RPA (pK(B)=8.6+/-0.04) and by SR 142801 in GPI (pK(B)=9.0+/-0.2) with apparent affinities comparable to that measured against tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptor-selective agonists, respectively. 5. Intravenous HEK-1 produced dose-related decrease of blood pressure in anaesthetized guinea-pigs (ED(50)=0.1 nmol kg(-1)) and salivary secretion in anaesthetized rats (ED(50)=6 nmol kg(-1)) with potencies similar to that of SP. All these effects were blocked by the selective tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonist, SR 140333. 6. We conclude that HEK-1 is a full agonist at tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptors, possesses a remarkable selectivity for NK(1) as compared to NK(2) or NK(3) receptors and acts in vivo experiments with potency similar to that of SP.</p>

                    <h2>Nonpeptide tachykinin receptor antagonists: I. Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characterization of SB 223412, a novel, potent and selective neurokinin-3 receptor antagonist.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 1997</h3>
                    <p>The in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile of SB 223412 [(S)-(-)-N-(alpha-ethylbenzyl)-3-hydroxy-2-phenylquinoline-4-carbo xamide], a novel human NK-3 (hNK-3) receptor antagonist, is described. SB 223412 demonstrated enantioselective affinity for inhibition of [125I][MePhe7]neurokinin B (NKB) binding to membranes of CHO cells expressing the hNK-3 receptor (CHO hNK-3). SB 223412, the (S)-isomer, (Ki = 1.0 nM), has similar affinity as the natural ligand, NKB (Ki = 0.8 nM) and another nonpeptide NK-3 receptor antagonist, SR 142801 (Ki = 1.2 nM). SB 223412 was selective for hNK-3 receptors compared with hNK-1 (>10,000-fold selective) and hNK-2 receptors (>140-fold selective), and selectivity was further demonstrated by its lack of effect, in concentrations up to 1 or 10 microM, in >60 receptor, enzyme and ion channel assays. SB 223412 enantioselectively inhibited the NKB-induced Ca++ mobilization in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the hNK-3 receptor. SB 223412 (10-1,000 nM) produced concentration-dependent rightward shifts in NKB-induced Ca++ mobilization concentration-response curves with a Kb value of 3 nM. In addition, SB 223412 antagonized senktide-induced contraction in the isolated rabbit iris sphincter muscle (Kb = 1.6 nM). In mice, oral administration of SB 223412 produced dose-dependent inhibition of behavioral responses induced by the NK-3 receptor-selective agonist, senktide (ED50 = 12.2 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic evaluation of SB 223412 in rat and dog indicated low plasma clearance, oral bioavailability and high and sustained plasma concentrations after 4 to 8 mg/kg oral dosages. The preclinical profile of SB 223412 (high affinity, selectivity, reversibility and oral activity) suggests that it will be a useful tool compound to define the physiological and pathophysiological roles of NK-3 receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of the binding sites of [3H]SR 48968, a potent nonpeptide radioligand antagonist of the neurokinin-2 receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical and biophysical research communications; 1993</h3>
                    <p>[3H]SR 48968, a radiolabeled nonpeptide antagonist of NK-2 receptor, has been tested in ligand-receptor binding assays using rat duodenum, hamster urinary bladder and guinea pig ileum membranes. [3H]SR 48968 bound to a single class of high affinity binding sites. Its affinity was slightly species-dependent. Its binding was inhibited by neurokinins, following the rank order of potency NKA > NKB > SP. It was also inhibited by peptide antagonists of NK-2 receptor (MEN 10,376, L 659,877), but their relative potencies were highly species-dependent. Unlabeled SR 48968, but not its R-enantiomer (SR 48965), also potently inhibited its binding. These data show that [3H]SR 48968 potently binds to NK-2 receptor and therefore is a useful tool to study NK-2 receptor.</p>

                    <h2>Structure-activity relationships of neurokinin A (4-10) at the human tachykinin NK(2) receptor: the role of natural residues and their chirality.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical pharmacology; 2001</h3>
                    <p>A structure-activity study of neurokinin A (NKA) (4-10) was performed to investigate the importance of residue and chirality for affinity and efficacy at the NK(2) receptor in human colon circular muscle. Two series of NKA(4-10) analogues were produced with either L-alanine or the D-enantiomer substituted. Their activities were determined in vitro by means of radioligand binding and isolated smooth muscle pharmacology. NKA was more potent than NKA(4-10) at the human, unlike the rabbit, NK(2) receptor. The contractile response of NKA(4-10) was unaffected by N-terminal acetylation. L-Ala substitution of Asp(4), Val(7), Leu(9), and Met(10) caused an 8- to 80-fold decrease, and substitution of Phe(6) caused a 5000-fold decrease in binding affinity (P < 0.01). Positions Ser(5) and Gly(8) were not significantly affected. In functional studies, a similar pattern was observed. The replacement of residues with their respective D-enantiomer drastically reduced binding affinity and functional potency, particularly at positions 6 and 7 (P < 0.05). NKA(4-10) analogues L-Ala(6), L-Ala(8), D-Phe(6), D-Val(7), and D-Met(10) were partial agonists. An excellent correlation was observed between binding and functional data (r = 0.95). A retro-inverso analogue of NKA(4-10) was inactive. In conclusion, the side chains of Asp(4), Phe(6), Val(7), Leu(9), and Met(10) are structurally important features of NKA(4-10) for agonist activity, and changes in amino acid chirality are detrimental to binding affinity and functional activity. Overall, our data are broadly similar to those of previous studies in the rat. However, at the human NK(2) receptor, unlike the rat, [Ala(8)]NKA(4-10) was an antagonist.</p>

Experimental evidence indicates that SP and NKA modulate the activity of inflammatory and immune cells, including mononuclear ones. This study evaluated the effects of mammalian tachykinins and selective tachykinin agonists and antagonists on human monocytes isolated from healthy donors: SP, NKA and NKB all evoked a dose-dependent superoxide anion (O2-) production and the NK2 selective agonist [beta-Ala8]-NKA(4-10) induced a full response. The NK3 selective agonist senktide was inactive, while the NK1 selective agonists septide and [Sar9Met(O2)11]SP displayed some effects. These results indicate that NK2 and also some NK1 receptors are present in monocytes isolated from healthy donors. The role of tachykinin receptor activation in rheumatoid arthritis was also investigated, by measuring O2- production and TNF-alpha mRNA expression in monocytes isolated from rheumatoid patients. Tachykinins enhanced the expression of this cytokine in both control and rheumatoid monocytes and NK2 receptor stimulation was shown to trigger an enhanced respiratory burst in monocytes from rheumatoid patients. In conclusion, these results indicate that NK2 and NK1 receptors are present on human monocytes, the former being preferentially involved in rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
