                    <h2>Monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 is a functional ligand for CC chemokine receptors 1 and 2B.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The CC chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3) activates human monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. MCP-3 has been reported to induce [Ca2+]i changes in cells transfected with the monocyte-selective MCP-1 receptor 2B (CC CKR2B) and competes for 125I-MCP-1 binding on CC CKR2B, suggesting that it may mediate monocyte responses to MCP-3. However, we now show that MCP-3 is a ligand and potent agonist for the macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha)/regulated on activation, normal T expressed, and secreted protein (RANTES) receptor CC CKR1 (rank order for [Ca2+]i changes = MIP-1 alpha > MCP-3 > RANTES), which is expressed in monocytes > neutrophils > eosinophils. 125I-MCP-3 bound directly to CC CKR1 and CC CKR2B (Ki = 8 and 7 nM, respectively). Binding to CC CKR1 was competed by all CC chemokines tested except MCP-1. In contrast, binding to CC CKR2B was competed only by MCP-3 and MCP-1. Both MCP-1 and MCP-3 were equipotent agonists (EC50 = 10 nM for [Ca2+]i changes). Thus, MCP-3 is a functional ligand for both CC CKR1 and CC CKR2B, which otherwise have distinct selectivities for CC chemokines. These data suggest that monocyte responses to MCP-3 could be mediated by both CC CKR2B and CC CKR1, whereas eosinophil responses to MCP-3 could be mediated by CC CKR1.</p>

                    <h2>High expression of the chemokine receptor CCR3 in human blood basophils. Role in activation by eotaxin, MCP-4, and other chemokines.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of clinical investigation; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Eosinophil leukocytes express high numbers of the chemokine receptor CCR3 which binds eotaxin, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-4, and some other CC chemokines. In this paper we show that CCR3 is also highly expressed on human blood basophils, as indicated by Northern blotting and flow cytometry, and mediates mainly chemotaxis. Eotaxin and MCP-4 elicited basophil migration in vitro with similar efficacy as regulated upon activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) and MCP-3. They also induced the release of histamine and leukotrienes in IL-3-primed basophils, but their efficacy was lower than that of MCP-1 and MCP-3, which were the most potent stimuli of exocytosis. Pretreatment of the basophils with a CCR3-blocking antibody abrogated the migration induced by eotaxin, RANTES, and by low to optimal concentrations of MCP-4, but decreased only minimally the response to MCP-3. The CCR3-blocking antibody also affected exocytosis: it abrogated histamine and leukotriene release induced by eotaxin, and partially inhibited the response to RANTES and MCP-4. In contrast, the antibody did not affect the responses induced by MCP-1, MCP-3, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, which may depend on CCR1 and CCR2, two additional receptors detected by Northern blotting with basophil RNA. This study demonstrates that CCR3 is the major receptor for eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-4 in human basophils, and suggests that basophils and eosinophils, which are the characteristic effector cells of allergic inflammation, depend largely on CCR3 for migration towards different chemokines into inflamed tissues.</p>

                    <h2>Characterisation of macrophage inflammatory protein-5/human CC cytokine-2, a member of the macrophage-inflammatory-protein family of chemokines.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of biochemistry; 1997</h3>
                    <p>A human monocyte-activating CC chemokine has been identified based on sequences in an expressed sequence tag (EST) cDNA database. The protein shows highest sequence identity to the macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) group of chemokines, particularly MIP-3 (76.7%) and MIP-1alpha (75.4%), and has been named MIP-5. Model building confirms that the protein has a similar three dimensional structure to other chemokines, but has an additional third disulphide bond. Northern blot analysis and reverse-transcriptase PCR show that the mRNA for MIP-5 is expressed at a high levels in liver, intestine and in lung leukocytes. MIP-5 induces chemotaxis of human monocytes, T-lymphocytes and, to a lesser degree, eosinophils at nanomolar concentrations; it has no effect on neutrophil migration. In receptor-binding assays, MIP-5 shows IC50 values of 12 nM for competition with 125I-MIP-1alpha for binding to CC-chemokine receptor (CCR)1, and 2.5 nM for competition with 125I-MCP-3 for binding to CCR3. It shows no ability to compete with ligand for binding to the two interleukin (IL)-8 receptors (CXC-chemokine receptors 1 and 2) or to CCR2, CCR4 or CCR5. Consistent with this binding data, MIP-5 was only able to induce calcium fluxes in CHO cells stably transfected with CCR1 or CCR3.</p>

                    <h2>A highly selective CCR2 chemokine agonist encoded by human herpesvirus 6.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>The chemokine-like, secreted protein product of the U83 gene from human herpesvirus 6, here named vCCL4, was chemically synthesized to be characterized in a complete library of the 18 known human chemokine receptors expressed individually in stably transfected cell lines. vCCL4 was found to cause calcium mobilization as efficiently as the endogenous chemokine ligand CCL2 through the CCR2 receptor, whereas the virally encoded chemokine did not affect any of the other 17 human chemokine receptors tested. Mutual cross-desensitization between CCL2 and vCCL4 was demonstrated in the CCR2-transfected cells. The affinity of vCCL4 for the CCR2 receptor was 79 nm as determined in competition binding against radioactively labeled CCL2. In the murine pre-B lymphocyte cell line L1.2 stably transfected with the CCR2 receptor, vCCL4 acted as a relatively low potency but highly efficacious chemoattractant being equally or more efficacious in causing cell migration than CCL2 and CCL7 and considerably more efficacious than CCL8 and CCL13. It is concluded that human herpesvirus 6 encodes a highly selective and efficacious CCR2 agonist, which will attract CCR2 expressing cells, for example macrophages and monocytes, conceivably for the virus to infect and to establish latency in. It is suggested that vCCL4 during reactivation of the virus in for example monocyte-derived microglia could perhaps be involved in the pathogenesis of the CCR2-dependent disease, multiple sclerosis.</p>
