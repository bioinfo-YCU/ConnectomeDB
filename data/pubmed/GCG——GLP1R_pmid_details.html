                    <h2>Cloning and functional expression of the human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrinology; 1993</h3>
                    <p>Truncated forms of glucagon-like peptide-1 are the most potent endogenous stimuli of insulin secretion and have powerful antidiabetogenic effects. To determine the structure and coupling mechanisms of the human GLP-1 receptor we have isolated two pancreatic islet cDNAs, encoding the 463 amino acid receptor and differing mainly in their 3' untranslated regions. The deduced amino acid sequence is 90% homologous with the rat GLP-1 receptor. Northern blot analysis shows expression of a single 2.7 kb transcript in pancreatic tissue. When expressed in COS-7 cells the recombinant receptor conferred specific, high affinity GLP-1(7-37) binding. GLP-1(7-37) increased intracellular cAMP in a concentration dependent manner and caused an increase in the free cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) from an intracellular pool, characteristic of phospholipase C (PLC) activation. Thus, like the structurally related glucagon and parathyroid hormone receptors, the human GLP-1 receptor can activate multiple intracellular signaling pathways including adenylyl cyclase and PLC. Knowledge of the GLP-1 receptor structure will facilitate the development of receptor agonists and elucidation of the important role of GLP-1 in normal physiology and disease states.</p>

                    <h2>Stable expression of the rat GLP-I receptor in CHO cells: activation and binding characteristics utilizing GLP-I(7-36)-amide, oxyntomodulin, exendin-4, and exendin(9-39).</h2>
                    <h3>Peptides; 1994</h3>
                    <p>Glucagon-like peptide-I (GLP-I) is a potent insulinotropic peptide that mediates its actions at pancreatic B-cells via specific receptors. In the present study we stably expressed the rat B-cell GLP-I receptor in CHO cells and studied binding characteristics and receptor activation utilizing the naturally occurring receptor agonist GLP-I(7-36)-amide (GLP-I), the proglucagon-derived GLP-I-related peptide oxyntomodulin, the GLP-I receptor agonist exendin-4, and the specific antagonist exendin(9-39). The potencies to displace [125I]GLP-I from the receptor were GLP-I > exendin-4 > exendin(9-39) > oxyntomodulin, and to displace [125I]exendin-4 GLP-I = exendin-4 > exendin(9-39) > oxyntomodulin. cAMP production was stimulated equally by GLP-I and exendin-4. Oxyntomodulin was less potent to stimulate cAMP generation. Exendin(9-39) blocked the stimulatory action of GLP-I and exendin-4 on cAMP production, but not that of oxyntomodulin. This study shows that GLP-I and exendin-4 are potent agonists at the transfected rat B-cell GLP-I receptor whereas oxyntomodulin is only a weak GLP-I receptor agonist. Furthermore, exendin(9-39) is a potent GLP-I receptor antagonist. This peptide is a valuable tool to further study the physiological actions of GLP-I.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor beta-arrestin 2 interaction: a high-affinity receptor phenotype.</h2>
                    <h3>Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.); 2005</h3>
                    <p>To dissect the interaction between beta-arrestin ((beta)arr) and family B G protein-coupled receptors, we constructed fusion proteins between the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor and (beta)arr2. The fusion constructs had an increase in apparent affinity selectively for glucagon, suggesting that (beta)arr2 interaction locks the receptor in a high-affinity conformation, which can be explored by some, but not all, ligands. The fusion constructs adopted a signaling phenotype governed by the tethered (beta)arr2 with an attenuated G protein-mediated cAMP signal and a higher maximal internalization compared with wild-type receptors. This distinct phenotype of the fusion proteins can not be mimicked by coexpressing wild-type receptor with (beta)arr2. However, when the wild-type receptor was coexpressed with both (beta)arr2 and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5, a phenotype similar to that observed for the fusion constructs was observed. We conclude that the glucagon-like peptide 1 fusion construct mimics the natural interaction of the receptor with (beta)arr2 with respect to binding peptide ligands, G protein-mediated signaling and internalization, and that this distinct molecular phenotype is reminiscent of that which has previously been characterized for family A G protein-coupled receptors, suggesting similarities in the effect of (beta)arr interaction between family A and B receptors also at the molecular level.</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor-binding determinants.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of molecular endocrinology; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a potent insulinotropic hormone currently under study as a therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes. Since an understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to high-affinity receptor (R) binding and activation may facilitate the development of more potent GLP-1R agonists, we have localized specific regions of GLP-1R required for binding. The purified N-terminal fragment (hereafter referred to as NT) of the GLP-1R produced in either insect (Sf9) or mammalian (COS-7) cells was shown to bind GLP-1. The physical interaction of NT with GLP-1 was first demonstrated by cross-linking ((125)I-GLP-1/NT complex band at approximately 28 kDa) and secondly by attachment to Ni(2+)-NTA beads. The GLP-1R NT protein attached to beads bound GLP-1, but with lower affinity (inhibitory concentration (IC(50)): 4.5 x 10(-7) M) than wild-type (WT) GLP-1R (IC(50): 5.2 x 10(-9)M). The low affinity of GLP-1R NT suggested that other receptor domains may contribute to GLP-1 binding. This was supported by studies using chimeric glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptors. GIP(1-151)/GLP-1R, but not GIP(1-222)/GLP-1R, exhibited specific GLP-1 binding and GLP-1-induced cAMP production, suggesting that the region encompassing transmembrane (TM) domain 1 through to TM3 was required for binding. Since it was hypothesized that certain charged or polar amino acids in this region might be involved in binding, these residues (TM2-TM3) were analyzed by substitution mutagenesis. Five mutants (K197A, D198A, K202A, D215A, R227A) displayed remarkably reduced binding affinity. These studies indicate that the NT domain of the GLP-1R is able to bind GLP-1, but charged residues concentrated at the distal TM2/extracellular loop-1 (EC1) interface (K197, D198, K202) and in EC1 (D215 and R227) probably contribute to the binding determinants of the GLP-1R.</p>
