                    <h2>Receptor subunit-specific action of oncostatin M in hepatic cells and its modulation by leukemia inhibitory factor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2000</h3>
                    <p>The related cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin M (OSM), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) direct the formation of specific heteromeric receptor complexes to achieve signaling. Each complex includes the common signal-transducing subunit gp130. OSM and LIF also recruit the signaling competent, but structurally distinct OSMRbeta and LIFRalpha subunits, respectively. To test the hypothesis that the particularly prominent cell regulation by OSM is due to signals contributed by OSMRbeta, we introduced stable expression of human or mouse OSMRbeta in rat hepatoma cells which have endogenous receptors for IL-6 and LIF, but not OSM. Both mouse and human OSM engaged gp130 with their respective OSMRbeta subunits, but only human OSM also acted through LIFR. Signaling by OSMRbeta-containing receptors was characterized by highest activation of STAT5 and ERK, recruitment of the insulin receptor substrate and Jun-N-terminal kinase pathways, and induction of a characteristic pattern of acute phase proteins. Since LIF together with LIFRalpha appear to form a more stable complex with gp130 than OSM with gp130 and OSMRbeta, co-activation of LIFR and OSMR resulted in a predominant LIF-like response. These results suggest that signaling by IL-6 cytokines is not identical, and that a hierarchical order of cytokine receptor action exists in which LIFR ranks as dominant member.</p>

                    <h2>Dual oncostatin M (OSM) receptors. Cloning and characterization of an alternative signaling subunit conferring OSM-specific receptor activation.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine whose structural and functional features are similar to other members of the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines (IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), granulocyte colonystimulating factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1), many of which utilize gp130 as a common receptor subunit. A biologically active OSM receptor has been previously described that consists of a heterodimer of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and gp130. This LIFR.gp130 complex is also a functional receptor for LIF. We have cloned and characterized an alternative subunit (OSMRbeta) for an OSM receptor complex (a heterodimer of gp130 and OSMRbeta) that is activated by OSM but not by LIF. The signaling capability of specific receptor subunit combinations was analyzed by independent assays measuring cell proliferation or induction of acute phase protein synthesis. Our results demonstrate that both LIF and OSM cause tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the gp130.LIFR combination, but the gp130.OSMRbeta complex is activated by OSM only. OSM-induced cellular responses, initiated through low affinity binding to gp130, are mediated by two heterodimeric receptor complexes that utilize alternative signal transducing subunits that confer different cytokine specificities to the receptor complex.</p>

                    <h2>The N-terminal cytokine binding domain of LIFR is required for CNTF binding and signaling.</h2>
                    <h3>FEBS letters; 2005</h3>
                    <p>Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) forms a functional receptor complex containing the CNTF receptor, gp130, and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). However, the nature and stoichiometry of the receptor-mediated interactions in this complex have not yet been fully resolved. We show here that signaling by CNTF, but not by LIF or oncostatin M (OSM), was abolished in cells overexpressing a LIFR mutant with the N-terminal cytokine binding domain deleted. Our results illustrate molecular differences between the CNTF active receptor complex and those of LIF and OSM and provide further support for the hexameric model of the CNTF receptor complex.</p>
