                    <h2>Pharmacological characterization of the human vasopressin receptor subtypes stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Three subtypes of human (h) arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptors, hV1A, hV1B and hV2, were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and characterized by [3H]-AVP binding studies. In addition, the coupling of the expressed receptor protein to a variety of signal transduction pathways was investigated. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms for the specific binding of [3H]-AVP to membranes, prepared from CHO cells transfected with hV1A, hV1B and hV2 receptors, yielded an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.39, 0.25 and 1.21 nM and a maximum receptor density (Bmax) of 1580 fmol mg(-1) protein, 5230 fmol mg(-1) protein and 7020 fmol mg(-1) protein, respectively. Hill coefficients did not differ significantly from unity, suggesting binding to homogenous, non-interacting receptor populations. Pharmacological characterization of the transfected human AVP receptors was undertaken by measuring the relative ability of nonpeptide AVP receptor antagonists, YM087, OPC-21268, OPC-31260, SR 49059 and SR 121463A, to inhibit binding of [3H]-AVP. At hV1A receptors, the relative order of potency was SR49059>YM087>OPC-31260>SR 121463A> >OPC-21268 and at hV2 receptors, YM087=SR 121463A>OPC-31260>SR 49059> >OPC-21268. In contrast, the relative order of potency, at hV1B receptors, was SR 49059> >SR 121463A=YM087=OPC-31260=OPC-21268. In CHO cells expressing either hV1A or hV1B receptors, AVP caused a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with an EC50 value of 1.13 nM and 0.90 nM, respectively. In contrast, stimulation of CHO cells expressing hV2 receptors resulted in an accumulation of cyclic AMP with an EC50 value of 2.22 nM. The potency order of antagonists in inhibiting AVP-induced [Ca2+]i or cyclic AMP response was similar to that observed in radioligand binding assays. In conclusion, we have characterized the pharmacology of human cloned V1A, V1B and V2 receptors and used these to determine the affinity, selectivity and potency of nonpeptide AVP receptor antagonists. Thus they may prove to be a valuable tool in further examination of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of AVP.</p>

                    <h2>The human V3 pituitary vasopressin receptor: ligand binding profile and density-dependent signaling pathways.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrinology; 1997</h3>
                    <p>The vasopressin (AVP) V3 pituitary receptor (V3R) is a G protein-coupled corticotropic phenotypic marker that is overexpressed in ACTH-hypersecreting tumors. Studies of the agonist/antagonist binding profile and signal transduction pathways linked to the human V3R have been limited because of the scarcity of this protein. To define the signals activated by V3Rs and the eventual changes triggered by developmental or pathological receptor regulation, we developed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-V3 cells stably expressing low, medium, or high levels of human V3Rs (binding capacity, <10, 10-25, and 25-100 pmol/mg, respectively). The affinity of the V3R for 21 peptide and nonpeptide AVP analogs was clearly distinct from that exhibited by the human V1R and V2R. AVP triggered stimulation of phospholipase C in CHO-V3 cells (partially sensitive to treatment with pertussis toxin) with a potency directly proportional to receptor density. V3R-mediated arachidonic acid release also was also sensitive to pertussis toxin and more efficacious in cells exhibiting medium than in those with high receptor density. AVP also stimulated the pertussis toxin-insensitive uptake of [3H]thymidine in CHO-V3 cells. The concentration-response curves for this effect were monophasic in cells expressing low and medium levels of V3Rs; on the contrary, a biphasic curve was observed in cells with high V3R density. Coupling of V3R to increased production of cAMP was only observed in CHOV3 high cells, suggesting a negative relationship between increased cAMP production and DNA synthesis. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by V3R was pertussis toxin insensitive, but was dependent on activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C; both the level and duration of activation were a function of the receptor density. Thus, the human V3R has a pharmacological profile clearly distinct from that of the human V1R and V2R and activates several signaling pathways via different G proteins, depending on the level of receptor expression. The increased synthesis of DNA and cAMP levels observed in cells expressing medium and high levels of V3Rs, respectively, may represent important events in the tumorigenesis of corticotroph cells.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological characterization of YM087, a potent, nonpeptide human vasopressin V1A and V2 receptor antagonist.</h2>
                    <h3>Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology; 1998</h3>
                    <p>The effects of YM087 (4'-[(2-methyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydroimidazo[4,5-d] [1]benzazepin-6-yl)-carbonyl]-2-phenylbenzanilide monohydrochloride), a novel nonpeptide vasopressin (AVP) receptor antagonist, on [3H]AVP binding to human AVP receptors (V1A, V1B and V2) cloned and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells generated from monkey renal tissue were studied. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms for the specific binding of [3H]AVP to membranes, prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with human V1A, V1B and V2 receptors, yielded an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.67 nM, 0.28 nM and 2.14 nM and a maximum receptor density (Bmax) of 2180 fmol/mg protein, 369 fmol/mg protein and 2660 fmol/mg protein, respectively. YM087 showed high affinity for AVP V1A and V2 receptors with Ki values of 6.3 and 1.1 nM, respectively, but had no effect on [3H]AVP binding to AVP V1B receptors. In COS-1 cells expressing either AVP V1A or V1B receptors, AVP caused a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). YM087 inhibited the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in COS-1 cells expressing AVP V1A receptors in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 14.3 nM, but did not influence this increase in AVP V1B-receptor expressing cells. In contrast, stimulation of COS-1 cells expressing AVP V2 receptors resulted in an accumulation of cAMP. YM087 inhibited AVP-induced cAMP production in COS-1 cells expressing AVP V2 receptors in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 1.95 nM. In all assays used, YM087 was devoid of any agonistic activity. These results suggest that YM087 is a potent nonpeptide dual human AVP V1A and V2 receptor antagonist, and that YM087 will be a powerful tool in investigation of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of AVP.</p>

                    <h2>1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) as an agonist on V1b vasopressin receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical pharmacology; 1997</h3>
                    <p>1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) is considered a standard vasopressin V2 receptor-selective agonist with a potent antidiuretic effect through V2 receptor without the induction of vasoconstriction through V1a receptor. Furthermore, DDAVP was reported to act as an agonist on non-V1a, non-V2 receptor to cause the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ in several tissues. However, the agonistic activity of DDAVP against the other vasopressin receptor, V1b (or V3), which can accumulate intracellular Ca2+ and which we recently cloned, has not been clarified. Hence, we compared the characteristics of DDAVP on V1b receptor with those on the other vasopressin receptors. In binding experiments, DDAVP more strongly inhibited [3H]arginine vasopressin binding to V1b than to V2 receptor (Ki: 5.84 nM vs 65.9 nM). In addition, DDAVP dose-dependently stimulated inositol turnover in human V1b receptor-expressing COS-1 cells. DDAVP acted as a full agonist on human V1b receptor (EC50: 11.4 nM) as well as on human V2 receptor (EC50: 23.9 nM). However, DDAVP behaved as a partial agonist toward rat V1b receptor (intrinsic activity: 0.7, EC50: 43.5 nM), while there was no significant difference in the agonistic properties of arginine vasopressin on human and rat V1b receptor. In conclusion, DDAVP acts as an agonist on V1b receptor, as it does on V2 receptor. These findings will allow us to better understand the physiological role of V1b receptor in pancreatic beta cells and in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, and help us to identify as yet unknown vasopressin receptors through which DDAVP cause the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ in other tissues.</p>

                    <h2>Tyr115 is the key residue for determining agonist selectivity in the V1a vasopressin receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The EMBO journal; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Using a three-dimensional model of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), we have previously succeeded in docking the neurohypophysial hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) into the V1a receptor. According to this model, the hormone is completely embedded in the transmembrane part of the receptor. Only the side chain of the Arg residue at position 8 projects outside the transmembrane core of the receptor and possibly interacts with a Tyr residue located in the first extracellular loop at position 115. Residue 8 varies in the two natural neurohypophysial hormones, AVP and oxytocin (OT); similarly, different residues are present at position 115 in the different members of the AVP/OT receptor family. Here we show that Arg8 is crucial for high affinity binding of AVP to the rat V1a receptor. Moreover, when Tyr115 is replaced by an Asp and a Phe, the amino acids naturally occurring in the V2 and in the OT receptor subtypes, the agonist selectivity of the V1a receptor switches accordingly. Our results indicate that the interaction between peptide residue 8 and the receptor residue at position 115 is not only crucial for agonist high affinity binding but also for receptor selectivity.</p>

                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 2003</h3>
                    <p>We have discovered a new, potent, selective, and orally active oxytocin receptor antagonist, (2S,4Z)-N-[(2S)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl]-4-(methoxyimino)-1-[(2'-methyl[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)carbonyl]-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamide (compound 1). We report the biochemical, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic characterization in vitro and in vivo of this compound. Compound 1 competitively inhibits binding of [3H]oxytocin and the peptide antagonist 125I-ornithine vasotocin analog to human and rat oxytocin receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA or Chinese hamster ovary cells with nanomolar potency. Selectivity against vasopressin receptor subtypes is >6-fold for V1a and >350-fold for V2 and V1b. Compound 1 inhibits oxytocin-evoked intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (IC50 = 8 nM). Compound 1 has no intrinsic agonist activity at the oxytocin receptor. Oxytocininduced contraction of isolated rat uterine strips is blocked by compound 1 (pA2 = 7.82). In anesthetized nonpregnant rats, single administration of compound 1 by i.v. or oral routes causes dose-dependent inhibition of contractions elicited by repeated injections of oxytocin with ED50 = 3.5 mg/kg i.v. and 89 mg/kg p.o., respectively. Compound 1 significantly inhibits spontaneous uterine contractions in pregnant rats near term when administered intravenously or orally. We conclude that compound 1 is a potent, selective, and orally active nonpeptide oxytocin receptor antagonist, which is a suitable candidate for evaluation as a potential tocolytic agent for the management of preterm labor.</p>
