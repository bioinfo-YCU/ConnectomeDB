                    <h2>Molecular characterization and expression of cloned human galanin receptors GALR2 and GALR3.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of neurochemistry; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Galanin is a 29- or 30-amino acid peptide with wide-ranging effects on hormone release, feeding behavior, smooth muscle contractility, and somatosensory neuronal function. Three distinct galanin receptor (GALR) subtypes, designated GALR1, 2, and 3, have been cloned from the rat. We report here the cloning of the human GALR2 and GALR3 genes, an initial characterization of their pharmacology with respect to radioligand binding and signal transduction pathways, and a profile of their expression in brain and peripheral tissues. Human GALR2 and GALR3 show, respectively, 92 and 89% amino acid sequence identity with their rat homologues. Radioligand binding studies with 125I-galanin show that recombinant human GALR2 binds with high affinity to human galanin (K(D) = 0.3 nM). Human GALR3 binds galanin with less affinity (IC50 of 12 nM for porcine galanin and 75 nM for human galanin). Human GALR2 was shown to couple to phospholipase C and elevation of intracellular calcium levels as assessed by aequorin luminescence in HEK-293 cells and by Xenopus melanophore pigment aggregation and dispersion assays, in contrast to human GALR1 and human GALR3, which signal predominantly through inhibition of adenylate cyclase. GALR2 mRNA shows a wide distribution in the brain (mammillary nuclei, dentate gyrus, cingulate gyrus, and posterior hypothalamic, supraoptic, and arcuate nuclei), and restricted peripheral tissue distribution with highest mRNA levels detected in human small intestine. In comparison, whereas GALR3 mRNA was expressed in many areas of the rat brain, there was abundant expression in the primary olfactory cortex, olfactory tubercle, the islands of Calleja, the hippocampal CA regions of Ammon's horn, and the dentate gyrus. GALR3 mRNA was highly expressed in human testis and was detectable in adrenal gland and pancreas. The genes for human GALR2 and 3 were localized to chromosomes 17q25 and 22q12.2-13.1, respectively.</p>

                    <h2>Cloning and characterization of the human galanin GALR2 receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Peptides; 1998</h3>
                    <p>We present the molecular cloning and characterization of the human galanin receptor, hGALR2. hGALR2 shares 85%, 39%, and 57% amino acid identities to rGALR2, hGALR1, and hGALR3, respectively. hGALR2, along with rGALR2, can be distinguished from the other cloned galanin receptors by a tolerance for both N-terminal extension and C-terminal deletion of galanin, as well as by a primary signaling mechanism involving phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis and calcium mobilization. By RT-PCR, GALR2 mRNA was abundant in human hippocampus, hypothalamus, heart, kidney, liver, and small intestine. A weak GALR2 mRNA signal was detected in human retina, and no signal was detected in cerebral cortex, lung, spleen, stomach, or pituitary.</p>

                    <h3>Brain research. Molecular brain research; 1998</h3>
                    <p>The neuropeptide galanin mediates a diverse spectrum of biological activities by interacting with specific G protein-coupled receptors. We have used homology genomic library screening and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques to isolate both genomic and cDNA clones encoding the human homolog of the recently cloned rat GALR2 galanin receptor. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the gene encoding human GALR2 (GALNR2) has been localized to chromosome 17q25.3. The two coding exons of the human GALNR2 gene, interrupted by an intron positioned at the end of transmembrane domain III, encode a 387 amino acid G protein-coupled receptor with 87% overall amino acid identity with rat GALR2. In HEK-293 cells stably expressing human GALR2, binding of [125I]porcine galanin is saturable and can be displaced by galanin, amino-terminal galanin fragments and chimeric galanin peptides but not by carboxy-terminal galanin fragments. In HEK-293 cells, human GALR2 couples both to Galphaq/11 to stimulate phospholipase C and increase intracellular calcium levels and to Galphai/o to inhibit forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulation. A wide tissue distribution is observed by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis, with human GALR2 mRNA being detected in many areas of the human central nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues.</p>

                    <h2>Characterisation of a new chimeric ligand for galanin receptors: galanin(1-13)-[D-Trp(32)]-neuropeptide Y(25-36)amide.</h2>
                    <h3>Regulatory peptides; 2001</h3>
                    <p>In this work, we studied a novel chimeric peptide, M242, galanin(1-13)-[D-Trp(32)]-neuropeptide Y(25-36)amide, and examined its properties in comparison with its parent peptide, M32, galanin(1-13)-neuropeptide Y(25-36)amide, a previously known high-affinity ligand for galanin receptors, and galanin itself. Binding assays performed in Bowes cells known to express human galanin receptor type 1 (hGalR1) and in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human galanin receptor type 2 (hGalR2) revealed that all three ligands had comparable affinities: at hGalR1<1 nM and at hGalR2<10 nM. However, in rat hippocampal membranes M242 had a 24-fold lower affinity than galanin (9.4 vs. 0.4 nM) and 134-fold lower affinity than M32 (9.4 vs. 0.07 nM). In the same tissue, we also examined the effects of these peptides on adenylate cyclase activity. M32 showed a weak antagonistic behaviour but M242 acted as a potent biphasic regulator of adenylate cyclase. In conclusion, we present and characterise a new peptide M242, which could be a useful tool in studies of galaninergic signalling.</p>

                    <h2>Cloning and expression of the human galanin receptor GalR2.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical and biophysical research communications; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Galanin is a peptide hormone which modulates a wide variety of physiological processes, including secretion, muscle contraction, cognitive function, the reproductive axis, and feeding. Two galanin receptor subtypes, GalR1 and GalR2, have been cloned; however, for GalR2 only the rat sequence has been reported in the literature. Our cloning of human GalR2 reveals its amino acid sequence to be 85% identical to rat GalR2 and 39% identical to human GalR1. Binding of [125I]galanin to the human GalR2 receptor transiently expressed in COS-7 cells was saturable (Kd = 0.24 nM +/- 0.06 nM) with a receptor density of 383 +/- 66 fmol/mg protein. Human galanin(1-30) bound with high affinity to the human GalR2 receptor, with a Ki value of 0.86 +/- 0.12 nM. With the identification of a second galanin receptor subtype, the specific functions of human galanin receptor subtypes can now begin to be addressed.</p>
