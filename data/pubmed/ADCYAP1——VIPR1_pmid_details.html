                    <h2>Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptors mediating insulin secretion in rodent pancreatic islets are coupled to adenylate cyclase but not to PLC.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrinology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a potentiator of glucose-induced insulin secretion. PACAP binds to a PACAP-specific receptor (PAC1) and to VPAC receptors (VPAC1 and VPAC2), which share high affinity for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). In the present study, the molecular expression of PACAP receptor isoforms and the signaling pathways involved in the insulin secretory effect of PACAP were investigated in isolated rat and mouse pancreatic islets. mRNA encoding PAC1-short, -hop, and -very short variants, as well as VPAC1 and VPAC2, were expressed in pancreatic islets. PACAP and VIP were equipotent in potentiating glucose-induced insulin release. Both peptides were also equipotent in increasing cAMP production, but PACAP was more efficient than VIP. Unlike carbachol, PACAP and VIP had no effect on inositol phosphate production. In the PAC1-deficient mouse, the insulinotropic effect of PACAP was reduced, and its differential effect on cAMP production was abolished, whereas the effects of VIP remained unchanged. These results clearly show that the insulinotropic effect of PACAP involved both VPAC and PAC1. The PAC1 variants expressed in rat and mouse pancreatic islets seem to be coupled to adenylate cyclase but not to PLC.</p>

                    <h2>Analogues of VIP, helodermin, and PACAP discriminate between rat and human VIP1 and VIP2 receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) acts through interaction with two subclasses of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors named VIP1 and VIP2 receptors. These receptors have been cloned in different species, such as rat and human. Considering the different distribution of both receptor subclasses, there is considerable interest in the development of selective agonists and antagonists. The present study compares the binding properties of VIP, PACAP, GRF, secretin, and helodermin analogues on recombinant rat and human VIP1 and VIP2 receptors. On both rat and human receptors, secretin and GRF had a higher affinity for the VIP1 receptor subtypes. The amino-shortened VIP, and the carboxy terminal-shortened VIP and PACAP analogues also presented a higher affinity for the VIP1 receptor. PHI, PHV, helodermin, and helospectin were selective for the human VIP2 receptor subtypes. These results suggest that the helical structure of the carboxy terminal end is necessary for VIP2 recognition. The differences between species were the following: PHI, PHV, helodermin, and helospectin had a higher affinity for the rat VIP1 receptor than for the human VIP1 receptor. On both rat and human receptors, D-Ala4 VIP and D-Phe4 VIP had a high affinity for the VIP1 receptor and a low affinity for the VIP2 receptor. Thus, three domains of the ligand involved in VIP1/VIP2 receptor discrimination were identified: the amino acid residue in position 4 ([D-Ala4], [D-Phe4]VIP), in positions 8 and 9 (the effects of helodermin and helospectin), and the carboxy terminal end (the effects of the shortened VIP and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide analogues).</p>

                    <p>The effects of a (N-stearyl, Norleucine17) vasoactive intestinal peptide hybrid ((SN)VIPhybrid) on cells stably transfected with VPAC,, VPAC2, or PAC1 receptors were investigated. (SN)VIPhybrid inhibited specific 125I-VIP binding to membranes derived from CHO cells transfected with VPAC, or VPAC2 receptors with high affinity (IC50 = 30 and 50 nM). (SN)VIPhyb inhibited specific 125I-PACAP-27 binding to membranes derived from NIH/3T3 cells transfected with PAC1 receptors with high affinity (IC50 = 65 nM). PACAP-27 caused cAMP elevation in NIH/3T3 cells transfected with PAC1 receptors and the increase cAMP caused by pituitary adenylated cyclase (PACAP) was inhibited by (SN)VIPhyb. Also, the increase in cAMP caused by VIP using CHO cells transfected with VPAC1 or VPAC2 receptors was antagonized by (SN)VIPhyb. These results indicate that (SN)VIPhyb is an antagonist for VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1 receptors.</p>

                    <h2>A systematic comparison of intracellular cyclic AMP and calcium signalling highlights complexities in human VPAC/PAC receptor pharmacology.</h2>
                    <h3>Neuropharmacology; 2006</h3>
                    <p>VPAC/PAC receptor activation classically results in cyclic-AMP production, with limited reports evaluating calcium signalling. These studies systematically characterise intracellular cyclic-AMP ([cAMP](i)) and calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) responses in CHO-cells expressing recombinant human (h) VPAC/PAC receptors (hVPAC(1)R, hVPAC(2)R, hPAC(1)R), using two simple, non-radioactive, HT-amenable assays. The rank order of potency (ROP) of the agonists VIP, PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 was similar in both assays for each individual receptor subtype, although potencies (EC(50)) in the [Ca(2+)](i) assay were approximately 100-fold lower. Importantly, this shift was also evident in SHSY-5Y cells endogenously expressing hPAC(1)R. Furthermore, [Ala(11,22,28)]VIP and maxadilan were selective hVPAC(1)R and hPAC(1)R agonists, respectively, and although R3P65 had no demonstrable hVPAC(2)R selectivity, these compounds exhibited comparable reductions in [Ca(2+)](i) EC(50) values. In contrast, PG97-269 and PG99-465, putatively selective hVPAC(1)R and hVPAC(2)R antagonists, respectively, were marginally less potent in [cAMP](i) studies, whereas M65 was equipotent at hPAC(1)R. Moreover, PG99-465 alone increased [cAMP](i) at all three hVPAC/PAC receptor subtypes, with full hVPAC(1)R and hPAC(1)R agonism. With equivalent agonist ROPs generated in both assays, [Ca(2+)](i) signalling provides an alternative approach to examine hVPAC/PAC receptor pharmacology. However, these studies underscore the paucity of receptor selective compounds, complexities in comparing drug potencies across assays, and the pleiotropic nature of VPAC/PAC-receptor signalling.</p>

                    <h2>Stable expression of the recombinant human VIP1 receptor in clonal Chinese hamster ovary cells: pharmacological, functional and molecular properties.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of pharmacology; 1996</h3>
                    <p>We stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with the recombinant human vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)1 receptor. A clone referred to as Clone 15 was isolated and studied for receptor properties. The following data were obtained: (1) one class of binding site was identified by Scatchard analysis of [125I]VIP binding to cell membranes with a Kd of 0.41 nM and a Bmax of 1.62 pmol/mg protein; (2) the constant Ki for the inhibition of [125I]VIP binding by VIP and related peptides was: VIP (0.9 nM) = pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)-27 (1.3 nM) < PACAP-38 (6.8 nM) < helodermin (46.0 nM) < human growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) (0.6 microM) < peptide histidine methionineamide (2.0 microM) < secretin (> 10 microM); (3) cross-linking experiments using [125I]VIP identified a single M(r) 67000 recombinant receptor; (4) VIP stimulated cAMP production in Clone 15 cells with an EC50 of 0.20 nM; (5) some previously described VIP receptor antagonists including [4-Cl-D-Phe6, Leu17]VIP, [Ac-Tyr1,D-Phe2]GRF-(1-29) amide and VIP-(10-28) inhibited [125I]VIP binding with a Ki of 0.7, 1.6 and 2.5 microM, respectively. They failed to stimulate cAMP production in Clone 15 cells and inhibited, at least partially, the VIP (0.3 nM)-evoked cAMP production; (6) exposure of Clone 15 cells to 10 nM VIP for 24 h resulted in a sharp decrease in Bmax in Clone 15 cells (0.43 vs. 1.62 pmol/mg protein in control cells) and in the potency and efficacy of VIP in stimulating cAMP. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies using confocal microscopy indicated that the receptor was internalized and sequestered in vesicular structures within the cells. It is concluded that Clone 15 cells provide a valuable tool to further characterize various functional and pharmacological aspects of the human VIP1 receptor.</p>

                    <h2>PAC1 receptor activation by PACAP-38 mediates Ca2+ release from a cAMP-dependent pool in human fetal adrenal gland chromaffin cells.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Previous studies have shown that human fetal adrenal gland from 17- to 20-week-old fetuses expressed pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptors, which were localized on chromaffin cells. The aim of the present study was to identify PACAP receptor isoforms and to determine whether PACAP can affect intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and catecholamine secretion. Using primary cultures and specific stimulation of chromaffin cells, we demonstrate that PACAP-38 induced an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) that was blocked by PACAP (6-38), was independent of external Ca(2+), and originated from thapsigargin-insensitive internal stores. The PACAP-triggered Ca(2+) increase was not affected by inhibition of PLC beta (preincubation with U-73122) or by pretreatment of cells with Xestospongin C, indicating that the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive stores were not mobilized. However, forskolin (FSK), which raises cytosolic cAMP, induced an increase in Ca(2+) similar to that recorded with PACAP-38. Blockage of PKA by H-89 or (R(p))-cAMPS suppressed both PACAP-38 and FSK calcium responses. The effect of PACAP-38 was also abolished by emptying the caffeine/ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) stores. Furthermore, treatment of cells with orthovanadate (100 microm) impaired Ca(2+) reloading of PACAP-sensitive stores indicating that PACAP-38 can mobilize Ca(2+) from secretory vesicles. Moreover, PACAP induced catecholamine secretion by chromaffin cells. It is concluded that PACAP-38, through the PAC(1) receptor, acts as a neurotransmitter in human fetal chromaffin cells inducing catecholamine secretion, through nonclassical, recently described, ryanodine/caffeine-sensitive pools, involving a cAMP- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation mechanism.</p>
