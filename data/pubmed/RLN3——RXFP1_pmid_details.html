                    <h2>H3 relaxin is a specific ligand for LGR7 and activates the receptor by interacting with both the ectodomain and the exoloop 2.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Leucine-rich repeat-containing, G protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) represent a unique subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors with a large ectodomain. Recent studies demonstrated that relaxin activates two orphan LGRs, LGR7 and LGR8, whereas INSL3/Leydig insulin-like peptide specifically activates LGR8. Human relaxin 3 (H3 relaxin) was recently discovered as a novel ligand for relaxin receptors. Here, we demonstrate that H3 relaxin activates LGR7 but not LGR8. Taking advantage of the overlapping specificity of these three ligands for the two related LGRs, chimeric receptors were generated to elucidate the mechanism of ligand activation of LGR7. Chimeric receptor LGR7/8 with the ectodomain from LGR7 but the transmembrane region from LGR8 maintains responsiveness to relaxin but was less responsive to H3 relaxin based on ligand stimulation of cAMP production. The decreased ligand signaling was accompanied by decreases in the ability of H3 relaxin to compete for (33)P-relaxin binding to the chimeric receptor. However, replacement of the exoloop 2, but not exoloop 1 or 3, of LGR7 to the chimeric LGR7/8 restored ligand binding and receptor-mediated cAMP production. These results suggested that activation of LGR7 by H3 relaxin involves specific binding of the ligand to both the ectodomain and the exoloop 2, thus providing a model with which to understand the molecular basis of ligand signaling for this unique subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors.</p>

                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 2005</h3>
                    <p>Relaxin family peptide 1 (RXFP1) receptor (LGR7) and RXFP2 receptor (LGR8) were recently identified as the receptor targets for H2 relaxin and insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), respectively. In this study, we define the pharmacology of these two receptors by using a number of receptor chimeras and relaxin family peptides. We have identified two binding sites on these receptors: one primary, high-affinity site within the ectodomain and a secondary, lower affinity site within the transmembrane region. The primary site was found to dictate receptor binding characteristics, although the lower affinity site also exerts some influence and modulates ligand affinity for the primary site in a manner dependent upon the peptide in question. Not all relaxin peptides were able to bind to the RXFP2 receptor, indicating that the relaxin-RXFP2 receptor interaction is species-specific. INSL3 was found to exhibit characteristics of a partial agonist at the RXFP2 and chimeric RXFP1/2 receptors, with low maximal cAMP responses but high potency in coupling to this pathway. cAMP accumulation studies also revealed that the binding sites couple to cAMP signaling pathways with differing efficiency: the high-affinity site signals with high efficiency, whereas the lower affinity site signals with little to no efficiency. Comparisons between RXFP1, RXFP2, the chimeric receptors, and the truncated receptors revealed that the interaction between receptor sites is critical for optimal ligand binding and signal transduction and that the ectodomain is essential for signaling. Evidence obtained in this study supports a two-stage binding model of receptor activation: binding to the primary site allows a conformational change and interaction with the low-affinity transmembrane site.</p>

                    <h2>Identification of relaxin-3/INSL7 as an endogenous ligand for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPCR135.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>GPCR135, publicly known as somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor, is expressed in the central nervous system and its cognate ligand(s) has not been identified. We have found that both rat and porcine brain extracts stimulated 35S-labeled guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) incorporation in cells over-expressing GPCR135. Multiple rounds of extraction, purification, followed by N-terminal sequence analysis of the ligand from porcine brain revealed that the ligand is a product of the recently identified gene, relaxin-3 (aka insulin-7 or INSL7). Recombinant human relaxin-3 potently stimulates GTPgammaS binding and inhibits cAMP accumulation in GPCR135 overexpressing cells with EC50 values of 0.25 and 0.35 nM, respectively. 125I-Relaxin-3 binds GPCR135 at high affinity with a Kd value of 0.31 nM. Relaxin-3 is the only member of the insulin/relaxin superfamily that can activate GPCR135. In situ hybridization showed that relaxin-3 mRNA is predominantly expressed in the dorsomedial ventral tegmental nucleus of the brainstem (aka nucleus incertus), as well as in discrete cells in the lateral periaqueductal gray and in the central gray nucleus. GPCR135 is expressed abundantly in the hypothalamus with discrete expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and supraoptic nucleus, as well as in the cortex, septal nucleus, and preoptical area. Relaxin-3 has previously been shown to bind and activate the LGR7 relaxin receptor. However, we believe that neuroanatomical colocalization of GPCR135 and relaxin-3, coupled with a clear high affinity interaction, suggest that GPCR135 is the receptor for relaxin-3. The identification of relaxin-3 as the ligand for GPCR135 provides the framework for the discovery of a new brainstem/hypothalamus circuitry.</p>
