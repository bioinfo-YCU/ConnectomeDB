                    <h2>Localization of beta 1-integrins in human cartilage and their role in chondrocyte adhesion to collagen and fibronectin.</h2>
                    <h3>Experimental cell research; 1993</h3>
                    <p>In the past, proteins have been described that may be involved in chondrocyte interactions with extracellular collagen, but little is known about the role of integrins in chondrocyte-collagen interactions. Here we report on the analysis of beta 1-integrin distribution in human fetal cartilage and on the expression of integrins on fetal chondrocytes, using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to integrin alpha- and beta-chains. We show the presence of alpha 2-, alpha 5-, alpha 6-, alpha v-, and beta 1-chains on freshly isolated chondrocytes by surface immunofluorescence in the fluorescence-activated cell sorter and by surface iodination followed by immunoprecipitation. Affinity chromatography of bovine chondrocyte membrane proteins on a collagen-Sepharose column followed by immunoprecipitation confirmed the presence of the collagen-binding alpha 2 beta 1-integrin on chondrocytes. Chondrocyte adhesion on native collagens I and II, on fibronectin, and on laminin was completely blocked by anti-beta 1; anti-alpha 2 reduced chondrocyte binding to collagen by only 40-50%; similarly, anti-alpha 1-antibodies were also able to reduce chondrocyte binding to collagen, although alpha 1 could not be unequivocally identified on chondrocytes. Chondrocyte adhesion to fibronectin was Mg(2+)- and Ca(2+)-dependent and could be inhibited by anti-alpha 5 and by RGD peptides. Chondrocyte adhesion to native collagens is Mg(2+)-, but not Ca(2+)-dependent and RGD-independent. Interestingly, although these data point to a role of alpha 2 beta 1 in chondrocyte-collagen interactions in vitro, alpha 2 could not be visualized in sections of human fetal cartilage, in contrast to the beta 1-, alpha v-, and alpha 5-chains which were present. This suggests that alpha 2 beta 1-integrin may be involved in the assembly of a pericellular collagen matrix in vitro, but may not be required for chondrocyte-collagen interactions in intact cartilage.</p>

                    <h2>Pro-collagenase-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1) binds the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin upon release from keratinocytes migrating on type I collagen.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2001</h3>
                    <p>In injured skin, collagenase-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1)) is induced in migrating keratinocytes. This site-specific expression is regulated by binding of the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin with dermal type I collagen, and the catalytic activity of MMP-1 is required for keratinocyte migration. Because of this functional association among substrate/ligand, receptor, and proteinase, we assessed whether the integrin also directs the compartmentalization of MMP-1 to its matrix target. Indeed, pro-MMP-1 co-localized to sites of alpha(2)beta(1) contacts in migrating keratinocytes. Furthermore, pro-MMP-1 co-immunoprecipitated with alpha(2)beta(1) from keratinocytes, and alpha(2)beta(1) co-immunoprecipitated with pro-MMP-1. No other MMPs bound alpha(2)beta(1), and no other integrins interacted with MMP-1. Pro-MMP-1 also provided a substrate for alpha(2)beta(1)-dependent adhesion of platelets. Complex formation on keratinocytes was most efficient on native type I collagen and reduced or ablated on denatured or cleaved collagen. Competition studies suggested that the alpha(2) I domain interacts with the linker and hemopexin domains of pro-MMP-1, not with the pro-domain. These data indicate that the interaction of pro-MMP-1 with alpha(2)beta(1) confines this proteinase to points of cell contact with collagen and that the ternary complex of integrin, enzyme, and substrate function together to drive and regulate keratinocyte migration.</p>

                    <h2>A novel gain-of-function mutation of the integrin alpha2 VWFA domain.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of biochemistry; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Integrin alpha2beta1 is the major receptor for collagens in human tissues, being involved in cell adhesion and the control of collagen and collagenase gene expression. The collagen binding site of alpha2beta1 has been localized to the alpha2 von Willebrand Factor type A (VWFA) domain (A-domain or I-domain) and the residues responsible for the interaction with collagen have been mapped. We report a study of alpha2 VWFA domain in which residue E318, which lies outside the collagen binding site, is mutated to tryptophan, showing that this is a gain-of-function mutation. Recombinant alpha2-E318W VWFA domain showed elevated and specific binding to collagen I compared with the wild-type. Side chain hydrophobicity was important for the gain-of-function as elevated binding was seen with E318I and E318Y, but not with E318R. The E318W mutation had additional effects on VWFA domain properties as alpha2-E318W VWFA domain differed from the wild-type in its cation preferences for ligand binding and in binding to monoclonal antibody JA203, which bound at a site distal to E318. The gain-of-function effect was not restricted to binding to collagen I as alpha2-E318W also showed elevated binding to collagen IV, collagen I C-propeptide, laminin and E-cadherin. Binding to these ligands was inhibited by collagen peptide containing the GFOGER motif, indicating that these bound to the VWFA domain by a similar mechanism to collagen I. These data indicate that residue E318 plays a novel and important role in modulating alpha2 VWFA domain--ligand binding and may be involved in the conformational changes associated with its regulation.</p>

                    <h2>The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin cell surface collagen receptor binds to the alpha 1 (I)-CB3 peptide of collagen.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1990</h3>
                    <p>We have previously shown that platelets adhere to collagen substrates via a Mg2(+)-dependent mechanism mediated by the surface glycoprotein Ia-IIa (human leukocyte very late activation protein 2, alpha 2 beta 1 integrin) complex. The adhesion is specific for collagen and is supported by collagen types I, II, III, IV, and VI. Several other members of the integrin family of adhesive protein receptors recognize discrete linear amino acid sequences within their adhesive glycoprotein ligands. Experiments with both intact platelets and with liposomes containing the purified receptor complex indicated that the alpha 2 beta 1 receptor recognized denatured type I collagen in a Mg2(+)-dependent manner. To further localize the binding site, the alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains of type I collagen were purified by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography and tested as adhesive substrates. Both the alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) chains effectively supported Mg2(+)-dependent platelet adhesion. The purified alpha 1(I) collagen chain was then subjected to cleavage with cyanogen bromide, and the resultant peptides were separated by chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose. Only the alpha 1(I)-CB3 fragment supported Mg2(+)-dependent platelet adhesion. The monoclonal antibody P1H5 which recognizes an epitope on the alpha 2 subunit of the integrin receptor and which inhibits the adhesion of both intact platelets and liposomes bearing the purified receptor to collagen also inhibited platelet adhesion to the alpha 1(I)-CB3 fragment. These results indicate that the alpha 2 beta 1 receptor recognizes a sequence of amino acids present in the alpha 1(I)-CB3 fragment of type I collagen. An identical or similar sequence likely mediates binding of the receptor to other collagen polypeptides.</p>
