                    <h2>CCK-B receptor: chemistry, molecular biology, biochemistry and pharmacology.</h2>
                    <h3>Progress in neurobiology; 1999</h3>
                    <p>Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide originally discovered in the gastrointestinal tract but also found in high density in the mammalian brain. The C-terminal sulphated octapeptide fragment of cholecystokinin (CCK8) constitutes one of the major neuropeptides in the brain; CCK8 has been shown to be involved in numerous physiological functions such as feeding behavior, central respiratory control and cardiovascular tonus, vigilance states, memory processes, nociception, emotional and motivational responses. CCK8 interacts with nanomolar affinities with two different receptors designated CCK-A and CCK-B. The functional role of CCK and its binding sites in the brain and periphery has been investigated thanks to the development of potent and selective CCK receptor antagonists and agonists. In this review, the strategies followed to design these probes, and their use to study the anatomy of CCK pathways, the neurochemical and pharmacological properties of this peptide and the clinical perspectives offered by manipulation of the CCK system will be reported. The physiological and pathological implication of CCK-B receptor will be confirmed in CCK-B receptor deficient mice obtained by gene targeting (Nagata el al., 1996. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93, 11825-11830). Moreover, CCK receptor gene structure, deletion and mutagenesis experiments, and signal transduction mechanisms will be discussed.</p>

                    <h2>Arginine 336 and asparagine 333 of the human cholecystokinin-A receptor binding site interact with the penultimate aspartic acid and the C-terminal amide of cholecystokinin.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1999</h3>
                    <p>The cholecystokinin-A receptor (CCK-AR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates important central and peripheral cholecystokinin actions. Residues of the CCK-AR binding site that interact with the C-terminal part of CCK that is endowed with biological activity are still unknown. Here we report on the identification of Arg-336 and Asn-333 of CCK-AR, which interact with the Asp-8 carboxylate and the C-terminal amide of CCK-9, respectively. Identification of the two amino acids was achieved by dynamics-based docking of CCK in a refined three-dimensional model of CCK-AR using, as constraints, previous results that demonstrated that Trp-39/Gln-40 and Met-195/Arg-197 interact with the N terminus and the sulfated tyrosine of CCK, respectively. Arg-336-Asp-8 and Asn-333-amide interactions were pharmacologically assessed by mutational exchange of Arg-336 and Asn-333 in the receptor or reciprocal elimination of the partner chemical functions in CCK. This study also allowed us to demonstrate that (i) the identified interactions are crucial for stabilizing the high affinity phospholipase C-coupled state of the CCK-AR.CCK complex, (ii) Arg-336 and Asn-333 are directly involved in interactions with nonpeptide antagonists SR-27,897 and L-364,718, and (iii) Arg-336 but not Asn-333 is directly involved in the binding of the peptide antagonist JMV 179 and the peptide partial agonist JMV 180. These data will be used to obtain an integrated dynamic view of the molecular processes that link agonist binding to receptor activation.</p>

                    <h2>Intermolecular interactions between cholecystokinin-8 and the third extracellular loop of the cholecystokinin A receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemistry; 2001</h3>
                    <p>The interaction of the C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin, CCK-8, with the third extracellular loop of human cholecystokinin-A receptor, CCK(A)-R(329-357), has been probed by high-resolution NMR and extensive computer simulations. The structure of CCK(A)-R(329-357) in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles consists of three alpha-helices, with the first and third corresponding to the extracellular ends of transmembrane (TM) helices 6 and 7. The central helix, residues W335-R345, is found to lie on the zwitterionic surface. Titration with CCK-8 produces a stable complex with a number of intermolecular NOEs between the C-terminus of the ligand (Trp(30), Met(31), Asp(32)) and the interface of TM6 and the third extracellular loop (N333, A334, Y338) of the receptor fragment. The mode of ligand binding based on these intermolecular NOEs is in agreement with a number of published findings from receptor mutagenesis and photoaffinity cross-linking. Utilizing these ligand/receptor points of interaction, the structural features of CCK(A)-R(329-357), and also the structures of CCK-8 and CCK(A)-R(1-47) previously determined, extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the CCK-8/CCK(A)-R complex were carried out. The results provide unique insight into the molecular interactions and forces important for the binding of CCK-8 to CCK(A)-R.</p>

                    <h2>Identification of two amino acids of the human cholecystokinin-A receptor that interact with the N-terminal moiety of cholecystokinin.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1997</h3>
                    <p>A region between residues 38 and 42 of the human cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) receptor was shown to be involved in the binding of CCK but not in that of JMV 179 and JMV 180, two peptides closely related to CCK (Kennedy, K., Escrieut, C., Dufresne, M., Clerc, P., Vaysse, N., and Fourmy, D. (1995) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 213, 845-852). In the present study, we have identified the residues of both the receptor and the ligand responsible for this differential binding. Residues Trp-39 and Gln-40 of the receptor were crucial for binding of the C-terminal nonapeptide of CCK as W39F and Q40N mutants demonstrated parallel decreases in both affinity and potency to induce accumulation of inositol phosphates (12.9- and 20.9-fold). The W39F and Q40N mutant receptors bound CCK analogues modified at their C-terminal end, including JMV 179 and JMV 180, as well as the C-terminal amidated heptapeptide of CCK, with identical affinities to the wild-type receptor. In contrast, W39F and Q40N mutants bound CCK octapeptide with the same decreased affinity as the CCK nonapeptide. The modeling of the CCK-A receptor and the docking of the peptide agonists [Thr,Nle]CCK9 and CCK-8 indicated that their N terminus was connected to the receptor through a strong bond network involving Trp-39 and Gln-40 thus confirming experimental data. These first molecular data identifying the agonist binding site of the human CCK-A receptor represent an important step toward the complete delineation of the agonist binding site and the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern differential activation of this receptor by CCK-related peptides.</p>

                    <h2>Met-195 of the cholecystokinin-A receptor interacts with the sulfated tyrosine of cholecystokinin and is crucial for receptor transition to high affinity state.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Sulfation of the tyrosine at the seventh position from the C terminus of cholecystokinin (CCK) is crucial for CCK binding to the CCK-A receptor. Using three-dimensional modeling, we identified methionine 195 of the CCK-A receptor as a putative amino acid in interaction with the aromatic ring of the sulfated tyrosine of CCK. We analyzed the role played by the two partners of this interaction. The exchange of Met-195 for a leucine caused a minor decrease (2. 8-fold) on the affinity of the high affinity sites for sulfated CCK-9, a strong drop (73%) of their number, and a 30-fold decrease on the affinity of the low and very low affinity sites for sulfated CCK-9, with no change in their number. The mutation also caused a 54-fold decrease of the potency of the receptor to induce inositol phosphates production. The high affinity sites of the wild-type CCK-A receptor were highly selective (800-fold) toward sulfated versus nonsulfated CCK, whereas low and very low affinity sites were poorly selective (10- and 18-fold). In addition, the M195L mutant bound, and responded to, sulfated CCK analogues with decreased affinities and potencies, whereas it bound and responded to nonsulfated CCK identically to the wild-type receptor. Thus, Met-195 interacts with the aromatic ring of the sulfated tyrosine to correctly position the sulfated group of CCK in the binding site of the receptor. This interaction is essential for CCK-dependent transition of the CCK-A receptor to a high affinity state. Our data should represent an important step toward the identification of the residue(s) of the receptor in interaction with the sulfate moiety of CCK and the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern CCK-A receptor activation.</p>

                    <h2>Arginine 197 of the cholecystokinin-A receptor binding site interacts with the sulfate of the peptide agonist cholecystokinin.</h2>
                    <h3>Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society; 1999</h3>
                    <p>The knowledge of the binding sites of G protein-coupled cholecystokinin receptors represents important insights that may serve to understand their activation processes and to design or optimize ligands. Our aim was to identify the amino acid of the cholecystokinin-A receptor (CCK-AR) binding site in an interaction with the sulfate of CCK, which is crucial for CCK binding and activity. A three-dimensional model of the [CCK-AR-CCK] complex was built. In this model, Arg197 was the best candidate residue for a ionic interaction with the sulfate of CCK. Arg197 was exchanged for a methionine by site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type and mutated CCK-AR were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells for pharmacological and functional analysis. The mutated receptor on Arg197 did not bind the agonist radioligand 125I-BH-[Thr, Nle]-CCK-9; however, it bound the nonpeptide antagonist [3H]-SR27,897 as the wild-type receptor. The mutant was approximately 1,470- and 3,200-fold less potent than the wild-type CCK-AR to activate G proteins and to induce inositol phosphate production, respectively. This is consistent with the 500-fold lower potency and 800-fold lower affinity of nonsulfated CCK relative to sulfated CCK on the wild-type receptor. These data, together with those showing that the mutated receptor failed to discriminate nonsulfated and sulfated CCK while it retained other pharmacological features of the CCK-AR, strongly support an interaction between Arg197 of the CCK-AR binding site and the sulfate of CCK. In addition, the mutated CCK-AR resembled the low affinity state of the wild-type CCK-AR, suggesting that Arg197-sulfate interaction regulates conformational changes of the CCK-AR that are required for its physiological activation.</p>
