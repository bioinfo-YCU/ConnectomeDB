                    <h2>Expression cloning of a human B1 bradykinin receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1994</h3>
                    <p>A cDNA clone encoding a human B1 bradykinin receptor was isolated from a human embryonic lung fibroblast cDNA library by expression cloning. The photoprotein aequorin was utilized as an indicator of the ability of the B1 receptor agonist [des-Arg10]kallidin to mediate Ca2+ mobilization in Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with RNA. A clone was isolated with a 1307-nucleotide insert which contains an open reading frame encoding a 353-amino acid protein with the characteristics of a G-protein-coupled receptor. The amino acid sequence of the B1 bradykinin receptor is 36% identical to the amino acid sequence of the B2 bradykinin receptor. The cloned B1 bradykinin receptor expressed in mammalian cells exhibits high affinity binding for 3H-labeled [des-Arg10]kallidin and low affinity for bradykinin. The B1 receptor antagonist [des-Arg10,Leu9]kallidin effectively displaces 3H-labeled [des-Arg10]kallidin from the cloned receptor, whereas the B2 receptor antagonist Hoe-140 (D-Arg0-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]bradykinin, where Thi is L-[3-(2-thienyl)alanyl], Tic is D-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-3-yl-carbonyl), and Oic is L-[(3aS, 7aS)-octahydroindol-2-yl-carbonyl]) does not. Therefore, the expressed receptor has the pharmacological characteristics of the B1 receptor subtype. The availability of both the cloned human B1 and B2 bradykinin receptors should allow the elucidation of the relative contributions of these two receptor subtypes in acute and chronic inflammatory processes.</p>

                    <h2>Stable expression of the human kinin B1 receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Characterization of ligand binding and effector pathways.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1997</h3>
                    <p>To delineate ligand binding and functional characteristics of the human B1 kinin receptor, a stable clone of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a single class of binding sites for [3H]des-Arg10-lysylbradykinin with a Kd of 0.3 nM and a Bmax of 38 fmol/mg protein ( approximately 40,000 receptors/cell) was isolated. Studies with peptide analogs showed that a lysine residue at position 1 (based on the lysylbradykinin sequence) of ligands was essential for high affinity binding to the human B1 receptor. In marked contrast to cloned Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human kinin B2 receptor, which internalized approximately 80% of the ligand within 5 min upon exposure to 2 nM [3H]bradykinin, exposure of cells expressing the B1 receptor to 1 nM [3H]des-Arg10-lysylbradykinin resulted in minimal ligand internalization. Stimulation of the B1 receptor led to inositol phosphate generation and transient increases in intracellular calcium, confirming coupling to phospholipase C, while immunoprecipitation of photoaffinity-labeled G-proteins from membranes indicated specific coupling of the receptor to Galphaq/11 and Galphai1,2. The B1, unlike the B2, receptor does not desensitize (as demonstrated by continuous phosphoinositide hydrolysis), enhancing the potential role of this receptor during inflammatory events.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular characterisation of cloned bradykinin B1 receptors from rat and human.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of pharmacology; 1999</h3>
                    <p>This report describes the characterisation of cloned rat and human bradykinin B1 receptors in African green monkey kidney fibroblast (Cos-7) cells. A ligand binding assay with [3H]des-Arg10-kallidin was used to compare their pharmacology with respect to known bradykinin B1 and B2 receptor ligands. In addition, the pharmacology of T-kinin and its' derivative des-Arg11-T-kinin was investigated. The cloned rat receptor had a similar pharmacology to that of the recently described mouse receptor and differs from that described for the human receptor. The rat receptor had a higher affinity for des-Arg11-T-kinin than the human receptor. These differences in pharmacological properties may relate to the presence of T-kinin, bradykinin and their des-Arg derivatives as the major physiological peptides in rat and the predominance of kallidin and its derivatives in human. We confirm that the rat bradykinin B1 receptor gene is organised in a two exon structure and differs from the human gene which has a three exon structure and we further examine the inducible expression of this gene in a wide range of tissues using Northern blotting.</p>

                    <h2>Stable expression of human kinin B1 receptor in 293 cells: pharmacological and functional characterization.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 1997</h3>
                    <p>1. We compared the binding properties of [3H]-desArg10-[Leu9]-kallidin, a radiolabelled kinin B1 receptor antagonist, to membranes from IMR-90 human embryonic fibroblasts and from 293 cells transiently or stably transfected with the human B1 receptor. 2. The dissociation constant (KD) of [3H]-desArg10-[Leu9]-kallidin and the affinity of several kinin receptor agonists and antagonists were similar between the native and cloned receptor, either transiently or stably expressed in 293 cells. In IMR-90 cells, the rank order of potency was that expected for a kinin B1 receptor. 3. The receptors transiently or stably expressed in 293 cells were fully functional with respect to their signalling properties. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis was increased in a concentration-dependent manner by the B1 receptor agonist, desArg10-kallidin. Functional coupling to the calcium pathway was also demonstrated for the native and stably expressed human B1 receptor. 4. In conclusion, the established stable and functional 293 cell clone may provide an important tool for further analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved in binding, activation, and coupling of the kinin B1 receptor.</p>
