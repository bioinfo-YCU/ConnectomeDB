                    <h2>The mammalian tachykinin receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>General pharmacology; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The tachykinins (TKs) are a family of small peptides which share the common C-terminal sequence Phe-X-Gly-Leu-MetNH2. Three peptides of this family, substance P, neurokinin A and neurokinin B, have an established role as neurotransmitters in mammals. 2. Three receptors for TKs have been cloned: they are G-protein coupled receptors with seven putative transmembrane spanning segments and have been termed NK1 (substance P-preferring), NK2 (neurokinin A-preferring) and NK3 (neurokinin B-preferring). 3. Synthetic agonists are available to selectively stimulate only one receptor, while natural TKs can act as full agonist at each one of the three receptors, albeit at different concentrations. 4. A number of potent and selective antagonists, both peptide and nonpeptide in nature, have recently been developed. 5. The introduction of these ligands has revealed an unforeseen pharmacological heterogeneity of NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptors which appears largely, if not exclusively, linked to the existence of species homologues of the three receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Human neuronal cells (NT2-N) express functional substance P and neurokinin-1 receptor coupled to MIP-1 beta expression.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of neuroscience research; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Substance P (SP), the most extensively studied and potent member of the tachykinin family, is a major modulator of inflammation and immunomodulatory activities within the central and peripheral nervous systems. We have examined the gene expression of SP and its receptor in a human neuronal cell line (NT2-N). Using reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the four isoforms of preprotachykinin-A gene transcripts (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) were detected in the NT2-N. We also identified the presence of mRNA for neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), a primary receptor for SP, in the NT2-N cells. Concomitant with NT2 cell differentiation into neurons, SP and NK-1R mRNA expression increased consistently. Intracellular SP and cell membrane NK-1R immunoreactivity were all observed in NT2-N cells. Most importantly, we demonstrated that SP and NK-1R presented in NT2-N cells are functionally involved in the regulation of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta (MIP-1beta), an important beta-chemokine participating in the activation and directional migration of immune cells to sites of central nervous systems (CNS) inflammation. Thus, SP and its receptor may play an important role in modulation of neuronal functions related to regulation of immune activities within the CNS. The NT2-N cell line is well suited for in vitro investigations of the SP-NK-1R pathway in immune responses and inflammation in the CNS.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological profile of the novel mammalian tachykinin, hemokinin 1.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>1. The effects of the novel mammalian tachykinin, hemokinin 1 (HEK-1), have been investigated by radioligand binding and functional in vitro and in vivo experiments. 2. Similar to SP (K(i)=0.13 nM), HEK-1 inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner and with high affinity [(3)H]-substance P (SP) binding to human NK(1) receptor (K(i)=0.175 nM) while its affinity for [(125)I]-neurokinin A (NKA) binding at human NK(2) receptor was markedly lower (K(i)=560 nM). 3. In isolated bioassays HEK-1 was a full agonist at tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptors. In the rat urinary bladder (RUB) HEK-1 was about 3 fold less potent than SP. In the rabbit pulmonary artery (RPA) HEK-1 and in the guinea-pig ileum (GPI), HEK-1 was about 500 fold less potent than NKA and NKB, respectively. 4. The responses to HEK-1 were antagonized by GR 82334 in RUB (pK(B)=5.6+/-0.07), by nepadutant in RPA (pK(B)=8.6+/-0.04) and by SR 142801 in GPI (pK(B)=9.0+/-0.2) with apparent affinities comparable to that measured against tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptor-selective agonists, respectively. 5. Intravenous HEK-1 produced dose-related decrease of blood pressure in anaesthetized guinea-pigs (ED(50)=0.1 nmol kg(-1)) and salivary secretion in anaesthetized rats (ED(50)=6 nmol kg(-1)) with potencies similar to that of SP. All these effects were blocked by the selective tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonist, SR 140333. 6. We conclude that HEK-1 is a full agonist at tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptors, possesses a remarkable selectivity for NK(1) as compared to NK(2) or NK(3) receptors and acts in vivo experiments with potency similar to that of SP.</p>

                    <h2>Septide and neurokinin A are high-affinity ligands on the NK-1 receptor: evidence from homologous versus heterologous binding analysis.</h2>
                    <h3>FEBS letters; 1996</h3>
                    <p>The three main tachykinins, substance P, neurokinin A (NKA), and neurokinin B, are believed to be selective ligands for respectively the NK-1, NK-2 and NK-3 receptors. However, NKA also has actions which cannot be mediated through its normal NK-2 receptor and the synthetic peptide [pGlu6,Pro9]-Substance P9-11--called septide--is known to have tachykinin-like actions despite its apparent lack of binding to any known tachykinin receptor. In the cloned NK-1 receptor expressed in COS-7 cells NKA and septide as expected were poor competitors for radiolabeled substance P. However, by using radiolabeled NKA and septide directly, it was found that both peptides in homologous binding assays as well as in competition against each other in fact bound to the NK-1 receptor with high affinity: Kd values of 0.51 +/- 0.15 nM (NKA) and 0.55 +/- 0.03 nM (septide). It is concluded that NKA and septide are high-affinity ligands for the NK-1 receptor but that they are poor competitors for substance P, which in contrast competes very well for binding with both NKA and septide.</p>

                    <h2>Stable expression of high affinity NK1 (substance P) and NK2 (neurokinin A) receptors but low affinity NK3 (neurokinin B) receptors in transfected CHO cells.</h2>
                    <h3>FEBS letters; 1992</h3>
                    <p>Stable CHO cell clones which selectively express all three rat tachykinin receptors were established by transfection. The binding of radiolabled substance P and neurokinin A (substance K) to CHO clones expressing the NK1 and NK2 receptors, respectively, were saturatable and of high affinity (Kd = 0.17 nM (NK1); 3.4 nM (NK2)). Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated for both receptors binding to a single population of binding sites, and competition binding studies showed that the binding specificities of the receptors corresponded to those of classical NK1 and NK2 receptors. In contrast, the binding of eledoisin to the NK3 receptor expressed in the transfected CHO cells was of low affinity (IC50 = 240 nM) compared to the high affinity of the receptor found when it was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (IC50 = 8 nM). However, in both cases the receptor exhibited the specificity of a classical NK3 receptor. The established cell clones may provide an important tool for further analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved in binding, activation, and coupling of receptors for tachykinin peptides.</p>

                    <h2>Nonpeptide tachykinin receptor antagonists: I. Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characterization of SB 223412, a novel, potent and selective neurokinin-3 receptor antagonist.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 1997</h3>
                    <p>The in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile of SB 223412 [(S)-(-)-N-(alpha-ethylbenzyl)-3-hydroxy-2-phenylquinoline-4-carbo xamide], a novel human NK-3 (hNK-3) receptor antagonist, is described. SB 223412 demonstrated enantioselective affinity for inhibition of [125I][MePhe7]neurokinin B (NKB) binding to membranes of CHO cells expressing the hNK-3 receptor (CHO hNK-3). SB 223412, the (S)-isomer, (Ki = 1.0 nM), has similar affinity as the natural ligand, NKB (Ki = 0.8 nM) and another nonpeptide NK-3 receptor antagonist, SR 142801 (Ki = 1.2 nM). SB 223412 was selective for hNK-3 receptors compared with hNK-1 (>10,000-fold selective) and hNK-2 receptors (>140-fold selective), and selectivity was further demonstrated by its lack of effect, in concentrations up to 1 or 10 microM, in >60 receptor, enzyme and ion channel assays. SB 223412 enantioselectively inhibited the NKB-induced Ca++ mobilization in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the hNK-3 receptor. SB 223412 (10-1,000 nM) produced concentration-dependent rightward shifts in NKB-induced Ca++ mobilization concentration-response curves with a Kb value of 3 nM. In addition, SB 223412 antagonized senktide-induced contraction in the isolated rabbit iris sphincter muscle (Kb = 1.6 nM). In mice, oral administration of SB 223412 produced dose-dependent inhibition of behavioral responses induced by the NK-3 receptor-selective agonist, senktide (ED50 = 12.2 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic evaluation of SB 223412 in rat and dog indicated low plasma clearance, oral bioavailability and high and sustained plasma concentrations after 4 to 8 mg/kg oral dosages. The preclinical profile of SB 223412 (high affinity, selectivity, reversibility and oral activity) suggests that it will be a useful tool compound to define the physiological and pathophysiological roles of NK-3 receptors.</p>

                    <h2>The unpredicted high affinities of a large number of naturally occurring tachykinins for chimeric NK1/NK3 receptors suggest a role for an inhibitory domain in determining receptor specificity.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Three chimeric receptors were constructed by exchanging exon sequences between human NK1 and NK3 receptor genes. The resulting chimeric receptors not only retained high affinities for their natural ligands substance P and neurokinin B but also exhibited surprisingly high affinities for other naturally occurring tachykinins including neurokinin A, neuropeptide K, neuropeptide gamma, eledoisin, kassinin, physalaemin, and phyllomedusin. In contrast, these chimeric receptors displayed a wide range of variability in their affinities for non-naturally occurring ligands including selective agonists and antagonists of NK1, NK2, and NK3 receptors. Since the only common feature among these naturally occurring neurokinin peptides is the conserved C-terminal sequences, our data suggest that these conserved sequences must play the major role in conferring high affinity binding to the chimeric receptors. To explain the apparently "improved" affinities of these naturally occurring ligands for the chimeric receptors as compared with their affinities for the parent NK1 and NK3 receptors, we are proposing that certain inhibitory domains that are present in the NK1 and/or NK3 receptors are compromised in these chimeric receptors. Upon disruption of these inhibitory domains during the formation of chimeras, the naturally occurring ligands can interact more favorably with chimeric receptors through their conserved C-terminal sequences. Based on this hypothesis, the binding affinities of natural tachykinin ligands may be largely determined by their conserved C-terminal sequences, whereas receptor selectivities of these ligands are influenced more by the presence or absence of inhibitory domains rather than specific binding domains on their target receptors.</p>

Compared to the unsubstituted parent compound SB 223 412 (Ki=27 nM +/- 9), affinity was not altered for the analogues 1c and 2c bearing a fluorine in position 8 (Ki approximately 24-27 nM), and was only slightly reduced for compounds 1b, 2b, 1e and 2e fluorinated or iodinated at the position 7 (Ki approximately 49-67 nM). A drastic reduction in binding (Ki > 115 nM) was observed for all other halogenated compounds 1a, 2a, 1d, 2d, 1f and 2f.</p>

Using reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the four isoforms of preprotachykinin-A gene transcripts (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) were detected in the NT2-N. We also identified the presence of mRNA for neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), a primary receptor for SP, in the NT2-N cells. Concomitant with NT2 cell differentiation into neurons, SP and NK-1R mRNA expression increased consistently. Intracellular SP and cell membrane NK-1R immunoreactivity were all observed in NT2-N cells. Most importantly, we demonstrated that SP and NK-1R presented in NT2-N cells are functionally involved in the regulation of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta (MIP-1beta), an important beta-chemokine participating in the activation and directional migration of immune cells to sites of central nervous systems (CNS) inflammation. Thus, SP and its receptor may play an important role in modulation of neuronal functions related to regulation of immune activities within the CNS. The NT2-N cell line is well suited for in vitro investigations of the SP-NK-1R pathway in immune responses and inflammation in the CNS.</p>
