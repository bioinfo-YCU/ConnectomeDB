                    <h2>The role of tachykinin receptor antagonists in the prevention of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation and cough.</h2>
                    <h3>The European respiratory journal; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Several recent observations suggest that tachykinins, such as substance P and neurokinin A, might be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary alterations. Progress in investigations on the physiological and pathological roles of tachykinins has been greatly facilitated by the availability of a number of highly selective nonpeptide antagonists for tachykinin neurokinin 1, 2 and 3 (NK1, NK2 and NK3) receptors. The use of selective tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonists suggests that tachykinin NK2 receptor stimulation plays an important role in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness in the guinea-pig. Others studies have also indicated that tachykinin NK1-receptors are involved in immediate or delayed neurogenic inflammation including microvascular leakage and the subsequent increase in plasma protein extravasation. A role for the sensory neuropeptide system has also been proposed in cough, as shown by the observation that the antitussive effect of tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonists has clearly been demonstrated in several experimental conditions, but the effect of tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonists is still debated. Taken together, the results obtained with the various selective receptor antagonists provide pharmacological evidence that tachykinins play a role in delayed bronchopulmonary alterations and suggest that tachykinin receptor antagonists may be useful for investigating mechanisms and possibly reducing airway functional alterations in asthmatic patients.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular characterisation, expression and localisation of human neurokinin-3 receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>FEBS letters; 1992</h3>
                    <p>The complete amino acid sequence of the human neurokinin-3 receptor was deduced by DNA sequence analysis of human genomic fragments. Comparison of the predicted primary structure with those for the human neurokinin receptors 1 and 2 shows a highly conserved pattern of seven hydrophobic regions with maximum divergence occurring at the amino- and carboxy-termini. The position of intron-exon junctions are identical to those in other reported neurokinin genes. Using a chimeric genomic-cDNA gene, the human NK-3 receptor was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes where it mediates membrane conductance changes in response to its agonist, neurokinin B. More significantly, expression of the gene in mammalian cells resulted in detection of receptor binding as well as neurokinin-stimulated calcium mobilization and arachidonic acid release, all displaying the pharmacological characteristics expected of a neurokinin-3 receptor. By using the polymerase chain reaction we have shown that mRNA for the human neurokinin-3 receptor is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system.</p>

                    <h2>Nonpeptide tachykinin receptor antagonists: I. Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characterization of SB 223412, a novel, potent and selective neurokinin-3 receptor antagonist.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 1997</h3>
                    <p>The in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile of SB 223412 [(S)-(-)-N-(alpha-ethylbenzyl)-3-hydroxy-2-phenylquinoline-4-carbo xamide], a novel human NK-3 (hNK-3) receptor antagonist, is described. SB 223412 demonstrated enantioselective affinity for inhibition of [125I][MePhe7]neurokinin B (NKB) binding to membranes of CHO cells expressing the hNK-3 receptor (CHO hNK-3). SB 223412, the (S)-isomer, (Ki = 1.0 nM), has similar affinity as the natural ligand, NKB (Ki = 0.8 nM) and another nonpeptide NK-3 receptor antagonist, SR 142801 (Ki = 1.2 nM). SB 223412 was selective for hNK-3 receptors compared with hNK-1 (>10,000-fold selective) and hNK-2 receptors (>140-fold selective), and selectivity was further demonstrated by its lack of effect, in concentrations up to 1 or 10 microM, in >60 receptor, enzyme and ion channel assays. SB 223412 enantioselectively inhibited the NKB-induced Ca++ mobilization in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the hNK-3 receptor. SB 223412 (10-1,000 nM) produced concentration-dependent rightward shifts in NKB-induced Ca++ mobilization concentration-response curves with a Kb value of 3 nM. In addition, SB 223412 antagonized senktide-induced contraction in the isolated rabbit iris sphincter muscle (Kb = 1.6 nM). In mice, oral administration of SB 223412 produced dose-dependent inhibition of behavioral responses induced by the NK-3 receptor-selective agonist, senktide (ED50 = 12.2 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic evaluation of SB 223412 in rat and dog indicated low plasma clearance, oral bioavailability and high and sustained plasma concentrations after 4 to 8 mg/kg oral dosages. The preclinical profile of SB 223412 (high affinity, selectivity, reversibility and oral activity) suggests that it will be a useful tool compound to define the physiological and pathophysiological roles of NK-3 receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular and pharmacological characterization of the murine tachykinin NK(3) receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of pharmacology; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Starting with a partial sequence from Genbank, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to isolate the full-length cDNA for NK(3) receptor from mouse brain. The murine NK(3) receptor has a predicted sequence of 452 amino acids, sharing 96% and 86% identity to the rat and human NK(3) receptors, respectively. Binding affinities and functional potencies of tachykinin receptor agonists were similar in HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293 cells expressing murine NK(3) receptor and human NK(3) receptor, although substance P and neurokinin A were more potent stimulators of Ca(2+) mobilization in murine NK(3) receptor cells. NK(3) receptor-selective antagonists from two structural classes, had 10- to 100-fold lower binding affinities for murine NK(3) receptor compared to human NK(3) receptor, and about 5- to 10-fold reduced potency in the murine NK(3) receptor functional assay. The results demonstrate species differences in the potencies of tachykinin receptor antagonists in murine and human NK(3) receptors, and the lower potencies in the former should be taken into consideration when using murine disease models.</p>
