                    <h2>Structural determinants for ligand-receptor conformational selection in a peptide G protein-coupled receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2007</h3>
                    <p>G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulate the majority of physiological processes through specific intermolecular interactions with structurally diverse ligands and activation of differential intracellular signaling. A key issue yet to be resolved is how GPCRs developed selectivity and diversity of ligand binding and intracellular signaling during evolution. We have explored the structural basis of selectivity of naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRHs) from different species in the single functional human GnRH receptor. We found that the highly variable amino acids in position 8 of the naturally occurring isoforms of GnRH play a discriminating role in selecting receptor conformational states. The human GnRH receptor has a higher affinity for the cognate GnRH I but a lower affinity for GnRH II and GnRHs from other species possessing substitutions for Arg(8). The latter were partial agonists in the human GnRH receptor. Mutation of Asn(7.45) in transmembrane domain (TM) 7 had no effect on GnRH I affinity but specifically increased affinity for other GnRHs and converted them to full agonists. Using molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that the highly conserved Asn(7.45) makes intramolecular interactions with a highly conserved Cys(6.47) in TM 6, suggesting that disruption of this intramolecular interaction induces a receptor conformational change which allosterically alters ligand specific binding sites and changes ligand selectivity and signaling efficacy. These results reveal GnRH ligand and receptor structural elements for conformational selection, and support co-evolution of GnRH ligand and receptor conformations.</p>

                    <h2>Structure-function studies of linear and cyclized peptide antagonists of the GnRH receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical and biophysical research communications; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Structurally new analogs of the peptidic GnRH receptor antagonist Cetrorelix as well as conformationally constrained cyclized deca- or pentapeptides were synthesized and selected peptides evaluated comprehensively. To understand how structural variations of the antagonistic peptide effect pharmacodynamic properties, binding affinities and antagonistic potencies toward the human and rat GnRH receptor were determined. Whereas large substituents in position 6 of linear peptides are compatible with high binding affinity (K(D) < 0.5 nM), all cyclized peptides except the cyclo[3-10] analog D-52391 depicted low binding affinity (K(D) > 10 nM). Binding affinity and antagonistic potency in vitro correlated for all peptides and surprisingly no discrimination between human and rat receptor proteins was observed. Since receptor residues W(101) and N(102) are involved in agonist and antagonist binding, equally potent but structurally different antagonists were tested for binding to the respective W(101)A and N(102)A mutants. In contrast to linear decapeptides, residues N(102) and W(101) are not involved in binding of D-23938 and W(101) is the critical residue for D-52391 binding. We conclude that although equally potent, peptidic GnRH receptor antagonists do have distinct interactions within the ligand binding pocket. Finally, selected antagonists were tested for testosterone suppression in male rats. The duration of testosterone suppression below castration levels differed largely from 1 day for Ganirelix to 27 days for D-23487. Systemic availability became evident as the most important parameter for in vivo efficacy.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological characterization of a novel nonpeptide antagonist of the human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, NBI-42902.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrinology; 2007</h3>
                    <p>Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by peptides that act at the GnRH receptor has found widespread use in clinical practice for the management of sex-steroid-dependent diseases (such as prostate cancer and endometriosis) and reproductive disorders. Efforts to develop orally available GnRH receptor antagonists have led to the discovery of a novel, potent nonpeptide antagonist, NBI-42902, that suppresses serum LH concentrations in postmenopausal women after oral administration. Here we report the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterization of this compound. NBI-42902 is a potent inhibitor of peptide radioligand binding to the human GnRH receptor (K(i) = 0.56 nm). Tritiated NBI-42902 binds with high affinity (K(d) = 0.19 nm) to a single class of binding sites and can be displaced by a range of peptide and nonpeptide GnRH receptor ligands. In vitro experiments demonstrate that NBI-42902 is a potent functional, competitive antagonist of GnRH stimulated IP accumulation, Ca(2+) flux, and ERK1/2 activation. It did not stimulate histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells. Finally, it is effective in lowering serum LH in castrated male macaques after oral administration. Overall, these data provide a benchmark of pharmacological characteristics required for a nonpeptide GnRH antagonist to effectively suppress gonadotropins in humans and suggest that NBI-42902 may have clinical utility as an oral agent for suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.</p>

                    <h2>Advances in understanding gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor structure and ligand interactions.</h2>
                    <h3>Reviews of reproduction; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the central regulator of the reproductive system and its analogues are used widely in the treatment of diverse diseases. The GnRH receptor is a member of the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which have seven transmembrane domains. Knowledge of these receptors has assisted the development of molecular models of the GnRH receptor that allow prediction of its three-dimensional configuration and the way GnRH binds and activates its receptor. Comparison with other GPCRs led to the discovery that Lys121, in the third transmembrane domain, has a role in agonist binding. The history of GnRH structure-activity studies has allowed the identification of an acidic residue in the third extracellular loop of the receptor that is required for binding of mammalian GnRH, while synthetic GnRH analogues have showed that Asn102, in the second extracellular loop, may interact with the carboxy-terminus of GnRH. These residues can now be incorporated into the receptor models that are being used to design orally active non-peptide GnRH analogues for contraception and treatment of a variety of reproductive disorders.</p>
