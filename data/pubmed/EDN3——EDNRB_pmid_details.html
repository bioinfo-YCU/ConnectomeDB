                    <h3>Cell; 1994</h3>
                    <p>Defects in the gene encoding the endothelin-B receptor produce aganglionic megacolon and pigmentary disorders in mice and humans. We report that a targeted disruption of the mouse endothelin-3 ligand (EDN3) gene produces a similar recessive phenotype of megacolon and coat color spotting. A natural recessive mutation that results in the same developmental defects in mice, lethal spotting (ls), failed to complement the targeted EDN3 allele. The ls mice carry a point mutation of the EDN3 gene, which replaces the Arg residue at the C-terminus of the inactive intermediate big EDN3 with a Trp residue. This mutation prevents the proteolytic activation of big EDN3 by ECE-1. These findings indicate that interaction of EDN3 with the endothelin-B receptor is essential in the development of neural crest-derived cell lineages. We postulate that defects in the human EDN3 gene may cause Hirschsprung's disease.</p>

                    <h2>Identification of specific regions of the human endothelin-B receptor required for high affinity binding with endothelin-3.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochimica et biophysica acta; 1994</h3>
                    <p>To investigate the endothelin-3 (ET-3) binding region of the endothelin-B (ETB) receptor, we have transiently produced various chimeric endothelin receptors in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Using 125I-ET-1 as the radioactive ligand in the displacement experiment, the replacement of both the second and third extracellular regions including the flanking transmembranes of the ETB receptor with the corresponding domains of the endothelin-A (ETA) receptor, increased the apparent Ki value for ET-3 from 5 x 10(-11) M to 10(-8) M. The affinity of this chimeric receptor, ETB-BC, for ET-3 was about two orders lower than ETB yet one order higher than ETA. Previously we have reported the involvement of Lys-140 located in the C-terminus of the second transmembrane region of the ETA receptor for ET-1 binding (Eur. J. Biochem., 220, 37-43, 1994). To assess the importance of the corresponding Lys-161 of the ETB receptor in ET-3 binding, we have replaced it with Ile in the ETB receptor. The mutant receptor had a 5.6-fold reduction in its affinity for ET-3, but its affinity for ET-1 remained similar. These results demonstrate that Lys-161 of the receptor is important for high affinity binding with ET-3 which, in part, confers the non-selective binding characteristics of the ETB receptor for ET isopeptides.</p>

                    <h3>The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine; 1994</h3>
                    <p>The amount of endothelin receptors in human prostate tissue was measured by radioligand binding techniques using 125I-Endothelin -1 and -3 (125I-ET-1, -3). Specimens of the non-hypertrophy group were obtained from 6 patients who underwent total cystectomy under the diagnosis of bladder cancer and those of the hypertrophy group from 6 prostatic hypertrophy patients who underwent open prostatectomy. 125I-ET-1 bound to the prostate tissue with the KD value of 0.033 +/- 0.012 nM in the non-hypertrophy group and with the KD value of 0.035 +/- 0.012 nM in the hypertrophy group. 125I-ET-3 bound to the prostate tissue with the KD value of 0.023 +/- 0.011 nM in the non-hypertrophy group and with the KD value of 0.029 +/- 0.016 nM in the hypertrophy group. The KD values were not significantly different between the hypertrophy and non-hypertrophy groups. The KD values of 125I-ET-1 and 125I-ET-3 were similar. The Bmax values (fmol/mg protein) of 125I-ET-1 binding to the prostate tissue were 32.18 +/- 3.69 to the non-hypertrophy group and 85.66 +/- 20.65 to the hypertrophy group. The Bmax values (fmol/mg protein) of 125I-ET-3 binding to the prostate tissue were 27.48 +/- 5.25 to the non-hypertrophy group and 75.90 +/- 13.46 to the hypertrophy group. The Bmax values of both 125I-ET-1 and 125I-ET-3 were significantly higher in the hypertrophy group than in the non-hypertrophy group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</p>

                    <h2>Characterization and ontogeny of endothelin receptors in human placenta.</h2>
                    <h3>The American journal of physiology; 1993</h3>
                    <p>Because of the potent mitogenic and vasoactive properties of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and the presence of its receptor in third trimester placenta, we postulated that ET-1 might be involved in human placental growth and vascularization during development. As an initial approach to test this hypothesis, placental ET receptors were characterized and quantified in each trimester of pregnancy. Membrane-rich particulates were prepared from first-, second-, and third-trimester villous human placenta obtained immediately after pregnancy termination or delivery. ET receptors were characterized by radioligand saturation analysis, ligand competition, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine the concentration, affinity, and specificity of ET binding sites, and to document the presence of specific ET-receptor subtype mRNA transcripts in placentas from each trimester. Kinetic determinations of 125I-labeled ET-1 binding yielded a Kd = 61 pM, consistent with the equilibrium determinations of 34 +/- 6 pM (n = 11). The concentration of ET receptors decreased significantly from 682 +/- 94 fmol/mg protein (n = 4) in the first trimester to 266 +/- 89 fmol/mg protein (n = 4) in the third trimester. Competition studies with unlabeled ET-1 indicated a single class of binding sites with a Ki = 49 +/- 5 pM (n = 9), whereas competition with ET-3 demonstrated binding sites with two affinities. The predominant sites had a Ki = 84 +/- 14 pM, similar to that for ET-1. The RT-PCR data confirmed that both ETA and ETB receptors mRNA transcripts are expressed in human placenta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</p>

                    <h2>Characterization of the binding of endothelin ETB selective ligands in human and rat heart.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 1996</h3>
                    <p>1. We determined competition binding characteristics of endothelin ETB receptor selective ligands in human left ventricle and compared these values to those obtained with rat left ventricle. Sarafotoxin S6c, ET-3, BQ788 and IRL2500 competed against [125I]-PD151242 (ETA selective radioligand) with low affinity in human left ventricle, confirming the ETB selectivity of these compounds. 2. ET-3 competed with moderate selectivity for ETB over ETA receptors in human left ventricle and with slightly higher selectivity in rat left ventricle (460 and 1,400 fold, respectively). There was a small difference in the affinity of ETA receptors for ET-3 (KD ETA in human left ventricle = 0.07 +/- 0.02 microM; KD ETA in rat left ventricle = 0.27 +/- 0.08 microM; P = 0.05) but no difference in the affinity of ETB receptors for this ligand (KD ETB in human left ventricle = 0.15 +/- 0.06 nM; KD ETB in rat left ventricle = 0.19 +/- 0.03 nM). 3. The selectivity of sarafotoxin S6c for ETB over ETA receptors in human left ventricle was 5,900 fold compared with 59,400 fold in rat left ventricle. The affinity of ETA receptors for sarafotoxin S6c was higher in human than in rat left ventricle (KD ETA = 2.00 +/- 0.20 microM and 3.50 +/- 0.26 microM, respectively; P = 0.03), while the affinity of ETB receptors for this ligand was higher in rat left ventricle (KD ETB = 0.06 +/- 0.02 nM) than in human left ventricle (KD ETB = 0.34 +/- 0.13 nM) (P = 0.02). The affinity of ETB receptors for sarafotoxin S6c in rat left ventricle determined in the absence or presence of GTP was the same indicating that differing affinity states of ETB receptors in human and rat left ventricle do not account for the variation observed between species. 4. There was no difference in the affinity of ETA receptors for BQ788 (KD ETA = 1.01 +/- 0.20 microM and KD ETA = 1.39 +/- 0.35 microM) or for the novel ETB selective antagonist. IRL2500 (KD ETA = 30.0 +/- 20.8 microM and KD ETA = 55.6 +/- 9.93 microM) in human and rat left ventricle, respectively. ETB receptors had a significantly higher affinity for BQ788 (KD ETB = 9.8 +/- 1.3 nM and KD ETB = 31.0 +/- 5.4 nM; P = 0.02) and IRL2500 (KD ETB = 78.2 +/- 9.7 nM and KD ETB = 300.0 +/- 75.1 nM; P = 0.03) in human and rat left ventricle, respectively. The synthetically synthesized ETB selective antagonist RES-701-1 (0.1 -3 microM) failed to inhibit [125I]-ET-1 binding in either tissue. 5. In conclusion, we have compared equilibrium dissociation constants for a number of ETB selective compounds in human and rat heart. The affinity of ETB receptors for sarafotoxin S6c, BQ788 and IRL2500 differed in human and rat left ventricle. No difference in affinity was detected for ET-3 binding at ETB receptors. Sarafotoxin S6c binding was unaffected by GTP indicating that the different receptor affinities in human and rat heart cannot be explained by differing ETB receptor affinity states. This study highlights the need to consider differences in binding characteristics that may arise from the use of tissues obtained from different species.</p>
