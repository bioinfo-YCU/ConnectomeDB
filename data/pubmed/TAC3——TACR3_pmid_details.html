                    <h2>The mammalian tachykinin receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>General pharmacology; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The tachykinins (TKs) are a family of small peptides which share the common C-terminal sequence Phe-X-Gly-Leu-MetNH2. Three peptides of this family, substance P, neurokinin A and neurokinin B, have an established role as neurotransmitters in mammals. 2. Three receptors for TKs have been cloned: they are G-protein coupled receptors with seven putative transmembrane spanning segments and have been termed NK1 (substance P-preferring), NK2 (neurokinin A-preferring) and NK3 (neurokinin B-preferring). 3. Synthetic agonists are available to selectively stimulate only one receptor, while natural TKs can act as full agonist at each one of the three receptors, albeit at different concentrations. 4. A number of potent and selective antagonists, both peptide and nonpeptide in nature, have recently been developed. 5. The introduction of these ligands has revealed an unforeseen pharmacological heterogeneity of NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptors which appears largely, if not exclusively, linked to the existence of species homologues of the three receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Functional expression of a novel human neurokinin-3 receptor homolog that binds [3H]senktide and [125I-MePhe7]neurokinin B, and is responsive to tachykinin peptide agonists.</h2>
                    <h3>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; 1997</h3>
                    <p>In 1992, Xie et al. identified a cDNA sequence in the expression cloning search for the kappa opioid receptor. When the cDNA was expressed in Cos-7 cells, binding of opioid compounds was observed to be of low affinity and without kappa, mu, or delta selectivity [Xie, G.-X., Miyajima, A. and Goldstein, A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 4124-4128]. This cDNA was highly homologous to the human neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptor sequence, and displayed lower homology to NK-1 and NK-2 sequences. This sequence was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express neurokinin receptors naturally, and ligand binding and second messenger characteristics were compared with a human NK-3 receptor. The NK-3 receptor homolog bound [3H] senktide with a Kd of 39 nM, similar to that of the NK-3 receptor. The rank order of tachykinin peptides competing for [3H]senktide binding at the NK-3 receptor homolog was [MePhe7]neurokinin B > senktide > substance P = neurokinin A > neurokinin B. This cell line also bound [125I-MePhe7]neurokinin B; however, neurokinin B was an effective competitor. Tachykinin peptides stimulated both inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and arachidonic acid release at NK-3 and NK-3 receptor homolog cell lines, with similar rank orders of potency of [MePhe7] neurokinin B = neurokinin B = senktide > NKA = substance P. These results indicate that expression of the NK-3 receptor homolog cDNA in the Chinese hamster ovary cell system induces the expression of a receptor site with many similarities but certain key differences from that of the human NK-3 receptor. The results are discussed with reference to the existence of a novel human tachykinin receptor.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular characterisation, expression and localisation of human neurokinin-3 receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>FEBS letters; 1992</h3>
                    <p>The complete amino acid sequence of the human neurokinin-3 receptor was deduced by DNA sequence analysis of human genomic fragments. Comparison of the predicted primary structure with those for the human neurokinin receptors 1 and 2 shows a highly conserved pattern of seven hydrophobic regions with maximum divergence occurring at the amino- and carboxy-termini. The position of intron-exon junctions are identical to those in other reported neurokinin genes. Using a chimeric genomic-cDNA gene, the human NK-3 receptor was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes where it mediates membrane conductance changes in response to its agonist, neurokinin B. More significantly, expression of the gene in mammalian cells resulted in detection of receptor binding as well as neurokinin-stimulated calcium mobilization and arachidonic acid release, all displaying the pharmacological characteristics expected of a neurokinin-3 receptor. By using the polymerase chain reaction we have shown that mRNA for the human neurokinin-3 receptor is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system.</p>

                    <h2>Antagonists for the neurokinin NK-3 receptor evaluated in selective receptor systems.</h2>
                    <h3>Regulatory peptides; 1990</h3>
                    <p>Four isolated vessels that are monoreceptor systems for neurokinins, the dog carotid artery and rabbit jugular vein (NK-1), the rabbit pulmonary artery (NK-2) and the rat portal vein (NK-3), were used to compare the activities of selective neurokinin agonists and evaluate the affinities of new NK-3 antagonists. Chemical modifications in the partial sequences NKA (4-10) and NKB (4-10), particularly the replacement of Val7 with an aromatic residue (Tyr, MePhe or Trp) and the extension of the peptide backbone in position 8, obtained with beta-Ala, led to compounds that maintain weak agonistic activities on the NK-1 and NK-2, and some of them also on NK-3 receptors but exert potent antagonism against NKB on the NK-3 receptor of the rat portal vein. Antagonistic affinity is the highest when Trp is used in position 7 of [beta-Ala8]-NKA (4-10) and MePhe in position 7 of [beta-Ala8]-NKB (4-10). Antagonism is selective for NKB or [MePhe7]-NKB, and appears to be specific, since the most active compound [Trp7, beta-Ala8]-NKA (4-10) is inactive against bradykinin on the rabbit jugular vein (B2 receptor), against SP on the rabbit jugular vein (NK-1 receptor), against desArg9-bradykinin on the rabbit aorta (B1 receptor), and against angiotensin II and histamine (AT and H receptors, respectively) in the rabbit aorta. The new NK-3 receptor antagonists described in the present study provide useful tools for neurokinin receptor characterization and for determining the roles of neurokinins in physiopathology.</p>

                    <h2>Nonpeptide tachykinin receptor antagonists: I. Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characterization of SB 223412, a novel, potent and selective neurokinin-3 receptor antagonist.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 1997</h3>
                    <p>The in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile of SB 223412 [(S)-(-)-N-(alpha-ethylbenzyl)-3-hydroxy-2-phenylquinoline-4-carbo xamide], a novel human NK-3 (hNK-3) receptor antagonist, is described. SB 223412 demonstrated enantioselective affinity for inhibition of [125I][MePhe7]neurokinin B (NKB) binding to membranes of CHO cells expressing the hNK-3 receptor (CHO hNK-3). SB 223412, the (S)-isomer, (Ki = 1.0 nM), has similar affinity as the natural ligand, NKB (Ki = 0.8 nM) and another nonpeptide NK-3 receptor antagonist, SR 142801 (Ki = 1.2 nM). SB 223412 was selective for hNK-3 receptors compared with hNK-1 (>10,000-fold selective) and hNK-2 receptors (>140-fold selective), and selectivity was further demonstrated by its lack of effect, in concentrations up to 1 or 10 microM, in >60 receptor, enzyme and ion channel assays. SB 223412 enantioselectively inhibited the NKB-induced Ca++ mobilization in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the hNK-3 receptor. SB 223412 (10-1,000 nM) produced concentration-dependent rightward shifts in NKB-induced Ca++ mobilization concentration-response curves with a Kb value of 3 nM. In addition, SB 223412 antagonized senktide-induced contraction in the isolated rabbit iris sphincter muscle (Kb = 1.6 nM). In mice, oral administration of SB 223412 produced dose-dependent inhibition of behavioral responses induced by the NK-3 receptor-selective agonist, senktide (ED50 = 12.2 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic evaluation of SB 223412 in rat and dog indicated low plasma clearance, oral bioavailability and high and sustained plasma concentrations after 4 to 8 mg/kg oral dosages. The preclinical profile of SB 223412 (high affinity, selectivity, reversibility and oral activity) suggests that it will be a useful tool compound to define the physiological and pathophysiological roles of NK-3 receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular and pharmacological characterization of the murine tachykinin NK(3) receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of pharmacology; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Starting with a partial sequence from Genbank, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to isolate the full-length cDNA for NK(3) receptor from mouse brain. The murine NK(3) receptor has a predicted sequence of 452 amino acids, sharing 96% and 86% identity to the rat and human NK(3) receptors, respectively. Binding affinities and functional potencies of tachykinin receptor agonists were similar in HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293 cells expressing murine NK(3) receptor and human NK(3) receptor, although substance P and neurokinin A were more potent stimulators of Ca(2+) mobilization in murine NK(3) receptor cells. NK(3) receptor-selective antagonists from two structural classes, had 10- to 100-fold lower binding affinities for murine NK(3) receptor compared to human NK(3) receptor, and about 5- to 10-fold reduced potency in the murine NK(3) receptor functional assay. The results demonstrate species differences in the potencies of tachykinin receptor antagonists in murine and human NK(3) receptors, and the lower potencies in the former should be taken into consideration when using murine disease models.</p>

                    <h2>Tachykinin receptors on human monocytes: their involvement in rheumatoid arthritis</h2>
                    <h3>Neuropeptides; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Three types of tachykinin receptors, namely NK1, NK2 and NK3, are known to preferentially interact with substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB), respectively. Experimental evidence indicates that SP and NKA modulate the activity of inflammatory and immune cells, including mononuclear ones. This study evaluated the effects of mammalian tachykinins and selective tachykinin agonists and antagonists on human monocytes isolated from healthy donors: SP, NKA and NKB all evoked a dose-dependent superoxide anion (O2-) production and the NK2 selective agonist [beta-Ala8]-NKA(4-10) induced a full response. The NK3 selective agonist senktide was inactive, while the NK1 selective agonists septide and [Sar9Met(O2)11]SP displayed some effects. These results indicate that NK2 and also some NK1 receptors are present in monocytes isolated from healthy donors. The role of tachykinin receptor activation in rheumatoid arthritis was also investigated, by measuring O2- production and TNF-alpha mRNA expression in monocytes isolated from rheumatoid patients. Tachykinins enhanced the expression of this cytokine in both control and rheumatoid monocytes and NK2 receptor stimulation was shown to trigger an enhanced respiratory burst in monocytes from rheumatoid patients. In conclusion, these results indicate that NK2 and NK1 receptors are present on human monocytes, the former being preferentially involved in rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

                    <p>Pre-eclampsia is a principal cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, affecting 5-10% of first pregnancies worldwide. Manifestations include increased blood pressure, proteinuria, coagulopathy and peripheral and cerebral oedema. Although the aetiology and pathogenesis remain to be elucidated, the placenta is undoubtedly involved, as termination of pregnancy eradicates the disease. Here we have cloned a complementary DNA from human placental messenger RNA encoding a precursor protein of 121 amino acids which gives rise to a mature peptide identical to the neuropeptide neurokinin B (NKB) of other mammalian species. In female rats, concentrations of NKB several-fold above that of an animal 20 days into pregnancy caused substantial pressor activity. In human pregnancy, the expression of NKB was confined to the outer syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta, significant concentrations of NKB could be detected in plasma as early as week 9, and plasma concentrations of NKB were grossly elevated in pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. We conclude that elevated levels of NKB in early pregnancy may be an indicator of hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and that treatment with certain neurokinin receptor antagonists may be useful in alleviating the symptoms.</p>
