                    <h2>Distribution and functional significance of the endothelin receptor subtypes in the rat adrenal gland.</h2>
                    <h3>Cell and tissue research; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Endothelins (ET) are a family of vasoactive peptides that act via two subtypes of receptors, named ETA and ETB. ET-1 binds to both ETA and ETB, whereas the isopeptide ET-3 preferentially binds to ETB. The localization of ETA and ETB receptors in the rat adrenal gland and their involvement in the adrenal secretagogue effect of ETs has been studied in vitro. Autoradiographic assessment of the selective displacement of [125I]ET-1, [125I]ET-3 and [125I]BQ-3020 (an ETB agonist) by BQ-123 or BQ-788 (specific antagonists of ETA and ETB, respectively) indicates that the zona glomerulosa and adrenal medulla possess both ETA and ETB, whereas the zona fasciculata/reticularis is exclusively provided with ETB. ET-1, ET-3 and BQ-3020 enhance aldosterone and corticosterone secretion by dispersed cells of the zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata/reticularis, respectively. BQ-123 does not affect the secretagogue action of these three agonists, whereas BQ-788 completely annuls it. ET-1 induces a marked rise in catecholamine release by fragments of the adrenal medulla, and both BQ-123 and BQ-788 partially reverse this effect. ET-3 and BQ-3020 elicit a catecholamine release that is less intense than that produced by ET-1; this response is unaffected by BQ-123 and abolished by BQ-788. Thus, in the rat, the corticosteroid secretagogue effect of ETs seems to be exclusively mediated by the ETB receptor subtype, and the catecholamine secretagogue action by both ETA and ETB. The functional relevance of ETA receptors present in the zona glomerulosa remains to be investigated.</p>

                    <h2>ETA receptor-mediated constrictor responses to endothelin peptides in human blood vessels in vitro.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 1995</h3>
                    <p>1. We have characterized the constrictor endothelin receptors present in human isolated blood vessels using ETA and ETB selective agonists and antagonists. 2. Monophasic dose-response curves were obtained for ET-1 with EC50 values of 6.8 nM in coronary artery, 3.9 nM in internal mammary artery, 17.4 nM in pulmonary artery, 14.5 nM in aorta and 3.2 nM in saphenous vein. In coronary artery, ET-2 was equipotent with ET-1 with an EC50 value of 5.7 nM. The non-selective peptide, sarafotoxin 6b, was 2-3 times less potent than ET-1 but the maximum responses to these two were comparable. 3. In each vessel ET-3 was much less active than ET-1. No response was obtained to ET-3 in aorta and pulmonary artery or in up to 50% of coronary artery, mammary artery and saphenous vein preparations. In those preparations that did respond, dose-response curves were incomplete at 300 nM. Variable contractions were also obtained with the ETB-selective agonist, sarafotoxin 6c (S6c). Where responses were detected, although S6c was more potent than ET-1 (EC50 values of 0.6-1.2 nM), the maximum response produced was always less than 20% of that to ET-1. 4. The synthetic ETB agonists, BQ3020 and [1,3,11,15Ala]-ET-1, were without effect in any of the five blood vessels at concentrations up to 3 microM. 5. ET-1-induced vasoconstriction was blocked by the ETA-selective antagonists, BQ123 and FR139317. Schild-derived pA2 values were 7.0, 7.4 and 6.9 for BQ123 and 7.6, 7.9 and 7.3 for FR139317 in coronary artery, mammary artery and saphenous vein, respectively, consistent with antagonism of ETA receptors. Slopes of the Schild regressions were not significantly different from one. Comparable values of pA2 were estimated for 3ftM BQ123 in aorta (7.4+/-0.5) and pulmonary artery (6.9) from the Gaddum-Schild equation.6. In conclusion we have shown that in human isolated blood vessels, ET-1 is more potent than ET-3 suggesting the presence of vasoconstrictor ETA receptors. This is supported by the lack of effect of the ETB agonists, BQ3020 and [1,3,1,1,15Ala]-ET-l and the ability of the ETA antagonists, BQ123 andFR139317 to block ET-1 responses. Some preparations did contract in response to low concentrations of the ETB-selective sarafotoxin 6c but responses were variable and the maximum was always much less than that to ET-1 in the same preparations. Therefore although constrictor ETB receptors were present on the smooth muscle of human blood vessels, vasoconstriction elicited by the endothelin peptides in vitro is via ETA receptor activation.</p>

                    <h2>Expression and biological effects of endothelin-1 in human gonadotropin-releasing hormone-secreting neurons.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism; 2000</h3>
                    <p>In a previous report, we demonstrated that in FNC-B4 cells, derived and characterized from a human fetal olfactory epithelium, both sex steroids and odorants regulate GnRH secretion. We now report the presence and biological activity of endothelin (ET)-1 in this GnRH-secreting neuronal cell. By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we found gene and protein expression of ET-1 and its converting enzyme ECE-1 in both fetal olfactory mucosa and FNC-B4 cells. The presence of authentic ET-1 in the conditioned media of FNC-B4 cells was further supported by combined RIAs and high-performance liquid chromatography studies. Experiments with radiolabeled ET-1 and ET-3 strongly indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites, corresponding to the ETA (16,500 sites/cell) and the ETB receptors (8,700 sites/cell). Functional studies, using selective analogs, indicated that these two classes of receptors subserve distinct functions in human GnRH-secreting cells. The ETA receptor subtype mediated an increase in intracellular calcium and GnRH secretion. Conversely, stimulation of the ETB subtype induced DNA synthesis and mitogen-activated protein kinase p44ERK1 expression. This is the first demonstration, in a human in vitro model, of a neuroendocrine role for ET-1 as regulator of GnRH-secreting neuron activity.</p>
