                    <h2>Cloning and characterization of the human corticotropin-releasing factor-2 receptor complementary deoxyribonucleic acid.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrinology; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Two CRF receptor subtypes (CRF1 and CRF2 receptors) with distinct brain localizations and pharmacological profiles have recently been cloned and characterized. For the CRF2 receptor subtype, at least 2 splice forms with different 5'-coding sequences (CRF2 alpha and CRF2 beta) have been identified in rat. In this article, we report the genomic structure and the corresponding complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence of the human CRF2 receptor. The gene coding for human CRF2 receptor consists of at least 12 exons and spans approximately 30 kilobases. The cDNA sequence in the protein-coding region is 94% identical to that of the reported rat CRF2 alpha receptor. At present, there is no evidence for the existence of a CRF2 beta receptor homolog in humans. The encoded receptor is 411 amino acids in length and is 70% identical to the human CRF1 receptor, with least sequence homology in the N-terminal extracellular domain (47% identical). Cells transfected with the full-length human CRF2 receptor cDNA responded to rat/human CRF and sauvagine by increasing the intracellular cAMP level, with EC50 values of approximately 20 and 1 nM, respectively. The CRF- and sauvagine-induced accumulation of intracellular cAMP could be competitively inhibited by the CRF receptor antagonist D-Phe-CRF. This pharmacological profile was comparable to that of the rat CRF2 alpha receptor. The relative abundance of the CRF2 receptor messenger RNA appears to be lower in humans than in rats for the tissues studied thus far.</p>

                    <h3>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; 1993</h3>
                    <p>Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is the principal neuroregulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and plays an important role in coordinating the endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stress and immune challenge. We report here the cloning of a cDNA coding for a CRF receptor from a human corticotropic tumor library. The cloned cDNA encodes a 415-amino acid protein comprising seven putative membrane-spanning domains and is structurally related to the calcitonin/vasoactive intestinal peptide/growth hormone-releasing hormone subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. The receptor expressed in COS cells binds rat/human CRF with high affinity (Kd = 3.3 +/- 0.45 nM) and specificity and is functionally coupled to adenylate cyclase. The CRF antagonist alpha-helCRF-(9-41) inhibits the CRF-stimulated increase in intracellular cAMP. Northern blot analysis reveals that the CRF receptor is expressed in the rat pituitary and brain as well as in the mouse AtT20 corticotropic cells. We also describe an alternatively spliced form of the receptor which includes an insert of 29 amino acids in the first intracellular loop.</p>

                    <h2>Identification of two corticotropin-releasing factor receptors from Xenopus laevis with high ligand selectivity: unusual pharmacology of the type 1 receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of neurochemistry; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Two cDNA clones encoding distinct members of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor family have been isolated from Xenopus laevis with PCR-based approaches. The first full-length cDNA amplified from Xenopus brain encoded a 415-amino acid protein with approximately 80% identity to mammalian CRF receptor type 1 (CRF-R1). The second full-length cDNA isolated from Xenopus brain and heart encoded a 413-amino acid protein with approximately 81% identity to the alpha-variant of mammalian CRF receptor, type 2 (CRF-R2). No evidence could be obtained that the beta-variant of CRF-R2 existed in Xenopus laevis. Binding studies using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells stably transfected with xenopus CRF-R2 showed that the CRF analogues urotensin I, urocortin, and sauvagine were bound with higher affinities than human/rat CRF, xenopus CRF, and ovine CRF. In contrast to human CRF-R1, xenopus CRF-R1 (xCRF-R1) was very selective for different CRF ligands. Urotensin I, urocortin, human/rat CRF, and xenopus CRF were bound with significantly (10-22-fold) higher affinities than ovine CRF (K(D) = 31.7 nM) and sauvagine (K(D) = 51.4 nM). In agreement with these binding data, EC50 values of 39.7 and 1.1 nM were found for sauvagine and for human/rat CRF or xenopus CRF, respectively, when the cyclic AMP production in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with xCRF-R1 was determined.</p>

                    <h2>Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1 from Tupaia belangeri--cloning, functional expression and tissue distribution.</h2>
                    <h3>European journal of biochemistry; 1998</h3>
                    <p>A cDNA clone encoding corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) type 1 (CRF-R1) has been isolated from the tree shrew Tupaia belangeri with a PCR-based approach. The full-length cDNA encoded a 415-amino-acid protein with highest sequence identity (approximately 98%) to human CRF-R1 and slightly less identity to rat or mouse CRF-R1 (approximately 97%). Only eight amino acids (residues 3, 4, 6, 35, 36 and 39 in the N-terminus, residue 232 in transmembrane domain 4 and residue 410 in the C-terminus) differed between tree shrew CRF-R1 (tCRF-R1) and human CRF-R1 (hCRF-R1). tCRF-R1 mRNA was detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR and RNase protection analysis in the pituitary and in brain areas such as amygdala, brainstem, cerebellum, cortex, olfactory bulb, and striatum. In peripheral organs, only weak expression of tCRF-R1 mRNA was observed in ovary, testis, and adrenal gland. Binding studies using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably transfected with tCRF-R1 showed that the CRF agonists ovine CRF (KD = 1.28 nM), human/rat CRF (KD = 1.09 nM), urocortin (KD = 0.37 nM) and sauvagine (KD = 0.77 nM), respectively, were bound with significantly higher affinities than the CRF antagonist astressin (KD = 12.4 nM). In agreement with the binding data half maximum effective EC50 values of 0.83 nM (human/rat CRF), 1.41 nM (ovine CRF), 1.25 nM (rat urocortin) and 0.71 nM (sauvagine) were calculated when the cAMP production in HEK293 cells stably transfected with tCRF-R1 was stimulated with the four CRF analogues. These data underline the close relationship between human and tree shrew CRF-R1.</p>

                    <h2>Different binding modes of amphibian and human corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 and type 2 receptors: evidence for evolutionary differences.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics; 2001</h3>
                    <p>The binding characteristics of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) type 1 (CRF(1)) and type 2 (CRF(2)) receptors from human (hCRF(1) and hCRF(2alpha)) and Xenopus (xCRF(1) and xCRF(2)) were compared using four different (125)I-labeled CRF analogs, the agonists (125)I-CRF and (125)I-sauvagine, and the antagonists (125)I-astressin ((125)I-AST) and (125)I-antisauvagine-30 ((125)I-aSVG). The hCRF(2alpha) and xCRF(2) receptors bound all four radioligands with different affinities, whereas hCRF(1) did not bind (125)I-aSVG, and xCRF(1) bound neither (125)I-sauvagine nor (125)I-aSVG. Competitive binding studies using unlabeled agonists and antagonists with hCRF(1) and hCRF(2alpha) receptors revealed that most agonists exhibited higher affinity in displacing agonist radioligands compared with displacement of antagonist radioligands. Exceptions were the agonists human and rat urocortin, which displayed high-affinity binding in the presence of either (125)I-labeled agonist or antagonist ligands. In contrast, the affinities of antagonists were independent of the nature of the radioligand. We also found that, in contrast to the mammalian CRF receptors, the affinity of ligand binding to xCRF(1) and xCRF(2) receptors strongly depended on the nature of the radioligand used for competition. For xCRF(1), competitors showed different rank order binding profiles with (125)I-CRF compared with (125)I-AST as the displaceable ligand. Similarly, binding of competitors to the xCRF(2) receptor showed markedly different profiles with (125)I-CRF as the competed ligand compared with the other radioligands. These data demonstrate that amphibian CRF receptors have distinctly different binding modes compared with their mammalian counterparts.</p>

                    <h3>Endocrinology; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Urocortin, a new member of the CRF peptide family which also includes urotensin I and sauvagine, was recently cloned from the rat midbrain. The synthetic replicate of urocortin was found to bind with high affinity to type 1 and type 2 CRF receptors and, based upon its anatomic localization within the brain, was proposed to be a natural ligand for the type 2 CRF receptors. Using a genomic library, we have cloned the human counterpart of rat urocortin and localized it to human chromosome 2. Human and rat urocortin share 95% identity within the mature peptide region. Synthetic human urocortin binds with high affinity to CRF receptor types 1, 2 alpha, and 2 beta, stimulates cAMP accumulation from cells stably transfected with these receptors, and acts in vitro to release ACTH from dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells. In addition, the CRF-binding protein binds human urocortin with high affinity and can prevent urocortin-stimulated ACTH secretion in vitro. The inhibitory effect of the CRF-binding protein on human urocortin can be blocked by biologically inactive CRF fragments, such as CRF(9-33).</p>

                    <h2>Urocortin, a mammalian neuropeptide related to fish urotensin I and to corticotropin-releasing factor.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a peptide first isolated from mammalian brain, is critical in the regulation of the pituitary-adrenal axis, and in complementary stress-related endocrine, autonomic and behavioural responses. Fish urotensin I and amphibian sauvagine were considered to be homologues of CRF until peptides even more closely related to CRF were identified in these same vertebrate classes. We have characterized another mammalian member of the CRF family and have localized its urotensin-like immunoreactivity to, and cloned related complementary DNAs from, a discrete rat midbrain region. The deduced protein encodes a peptide that we name urocortin, which is related to urotensin (63% sequence identity) and CRF (45% sequence identity). Synthetic urocortin evokes secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) both in vitro and in vivo and binds and activates transfected type-1 CRF receptors, the subtype expressed by pituitary corticotropes. The coincidence of urotensin-like immunoreactivity with type-2 CRF receptors in brain, and our observation that urocortin is more potent than CRF at binding and activating type-2 CRF receptors, as well as at inducing c-Fos (an index of cellular activation) in regions enriched in type-2 CRF receptors, indicate that this new peptide could be an endogenous ligand for type-2 CRF receptors.</p>

                    <h2>Localization of ligand-binding domains of human corticotropin-releasing factor receptor: a chimeric receptor approach.</h2>
                    <h3>Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.); 1997</h3>
                    <p>Two CRF receptors, CRFR1 and CRFR2, have recently been cloned and characterized. CRFR1 shares 70% sequence identity with CRFR2, yet has much higher affinity for rat/human CRF (r/hCRF) than CRFR2. As a first step toward understanding the interactions between rat/human CRF and its receptor, the regions that are involved in receptor-ligand binding and/or receptor activation were determined by using chimeric receptor constructs of the two human CRFR subtypes, CRFR1 and CRFR2, followed by generating point mutations of the receptor. The EC50 values in stimulation of intracellular cAMP of the chimeric and mutant receptors for the peptide ligand were determined using a cAMP-dependent reporter system. Three regions of the receptor were found to be important for optimal binding of r/hCRF and/or receptor activation. The first region was mapped to the junction of the third extracellular domain and the fifth transmembrane domain; substitution of three amino acids of CRFR1 in this region (Val266, Tyr267, and Thr268) by the corresponding CRFR2 amino acids (Asp266, Leu267, and Val268) increased the EC50 value by approximately 10-fold. The other two regions were localized to the second extracellular domain of the CRFR1 involving amino acids 175-178 and His189 residue. Substitutions in these two regions each increased the EC50 value for r/hCRF by approximately 7- to 8-fold only in the presence of the amino acid 266-268 mutation involving the first region, suggesting that their roles in peptide ligand binding might be secondary.</p>
