                    <h2>Monocyte chemotactic protein-2 (MCP-2) uses CCR1 and CCR2B as its functional receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1997</h3>
                    <p>Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-2 is a member of the C-C chemokine subfamily, which shares more than 60% sequence homology with MCP-1 and MCP-3 and about 30% homology with macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, regulated on activation of normal T cell expressed (RANTES), and MIP-1beta. Despite this considerable sequence homology to other C-C chemokines, MCP-2 appears to have unique functional properties in comparison with other C-C chemokines such as MCP-1 and MCP-3. Although evidence obtained from studies on leukocytes suggested that MCP-2 may share the receptors with these C-C chemokines, the actual functional receptors for MCP-2 have not yet been identified. In this study, by using radioiodinated MCP-2, we identified high affinity binding sites for MCP-2 on human peripheral blood monocytes. The MCP-2 binding was competed for by MCP-1 and MCP-3, but less well by MIP-1alpha or RANTES. In experiments using cells transfected with C-C chemokine receptors, 125I-MCP-2 bound to human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with CCR1 or CCR2B, known to also bind MIP-1alpha/RANTES and MCP-1, respectively, but both shared by MCP-3. The binding of 125I-MCP-2 to these receptor-transfected cells was displaced completely by chemokines that bind to these receptors. Both CCR1- and CCR2B-transfected 293 cells showed significant migration in response to MCP-2, in addition to responding to other specific chemokines. These results clearly demonstrate that MCP-2, unlike MCP-1, uses both CCR1 as well as CCR2B as its functional receptors, and this accounts for the unique activities of MCP-2.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological characterization of the chemokine receptor, hCCR1 in a stable transfectant and differentiated HL-60 cells: antagonism of hCCR1 activation by MIP-1beta.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>C-C chemokine receptor-1 (CCR1) has been implicated in mediating a variety of inflammatory conditions including multiple sclerosis and organ rejection. Although originally referred to as the MIP-1alpha/RANTES receptor, CCR1 is quite promiscuous and can be activated by numerous chemokines. We used radioligand binding and [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays in membranes from a cell line transfected to express CCR1 (Ba/F3-hCCR1) to characterize a panel of chemokines (HCC-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MIP-1delta, MPIF-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and RANTES) as CCR1 ligands. In this recombinant model, these chemokines displaced 125I-MIP-1alpha with a wide range of potencies and, with the exception of MCP-2, acted as full agonists in stimulating [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange. We then assessed the utility of HL-60 cells cultured with known differentiating agents (PMA, DMSO, dibutyryl-cAMP or retinoic acid) for investigating CCR1 pharmacology. In [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, membranes from cells cultured with retinoic acid (4-6 days) were the most responsive to activation by MIP-1alpha and MPIF-1. FACS analysis and comparative pharmacology confirmed that these activities were mediated by CCR1. Using [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, intracellular calcium flux and/or whole cell chemotaxis assays in HL-60(Rx) cells, we validated that MIP-1alpha was the most potent CCR1 ligand (MIP-1alpha>MPIF-1>RANTES>or=MIP-1beta) although the ligands differed in their efficacy as agonists. MPIF-1 was the more efficacious (MPIF-1>RANTES=MIP-1alpha>>MIP-1beta). 125I-MIP-1beta binding in Ba/F3-hCCR1 and HL-60(Rx) membranes was competitively displaced by MIP-1alpha, MPIF-1 and MIP-1beta. The binding K(i) for these chemokines with 125I-MIP-1beta were essentially identical in the two membrane systems. Lastly, MIP-1beta antagonized [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange, Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis in HL-60(Rx) cells in response to robust agonists such as MIP-1alpha, RANTES and MPIF-1. Based on our results, we propose that MIP-1beta could function as an endogenous inhibitor of CCR1 function.</p>

                    <h2>Synthesis and characterization of fluorescent and photoactivatable MIP-1alpha ligands and interactions with chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of medicinal chemistry; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Photoaffinity and fluorescent analogues of the 70-amino acid chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) were designed, synthesized, characterized, and applied to probe MIP-1alpha interactions with the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5. The photoactivatable MIP-1alpha ligand, BP-MIP-1alpha, and the fluorescent ligand, Flu-MIP-1alpha were prepared by selective chemical coupling of p-benzoylphenylthiocarbamyl or fluoresceinthiocarbamyl, respectively, at the N-terminus of MIP-1alpha. Both ligands BP-MIP-1alpha and Flu-MIP-1alpha retained high binding affinity and agonist potency at CCR1 and CCR5. Photoaffinity labeling of CCR1 and CCR5 receptors stably expressed in CHO cells resulted in specific covalent attachment of [(125)I]BP-MIP-1alpha and production of protein complexes of 54 and 48 kDa, respectively, on SDS-PAGE. This represents the first photo-cross-linking between a chemokine and its receptor. Flu-MIP-1alpha selectively labeled CCR1 or CCR5 receptors expressed in CHO cells and was used to characterize receptor binding domains. When bound to CCR1 or CCR5 receptors, the fluorescence signal of Flu-MIP-1alpha was quenched by collision with iodide indicating that the N-terminal end of MIP-1alpha is accessible to the solvent. These data strongly suggest that the N-terminal end of MIP-1alpha interacts with domains of CCR1 or CCR5 receptors located at the extracellular surface. The photoactivatable BP-MIP-1alpha described here should prove valuable for the identification of contact sites on receptors by photoaffinity labeling experiments.</p>

                    <h2>Identification and characterization of small molecule functional antagonists of the CCR1 chemokine receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1998</h3>
                    <p>The CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed) have been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Since their effects are mediated through the CCR1 chemokine receptor, we set up a small molecule CCR1 antagonist program to search for inhibitors. Through high capacity screening we discovered a number of 4-hydroxypiperidine compounds with CCR1 antagonist activity and report their synthesis and in vitro pharmacology here. Scatchard analysis of the competition binding data revealed that the compounds had Ki values ranging from 40 to 4000 nM. The pharmacological profile of the most potent member of this series, compound 1 (2-2-diphenyl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)piperidin-lyl)valeronitri te), was further evaluated. Compound 1 showed concentration-dependent inhibition of MIP-1alpha-induced extracellular acidification and Ca2+ mobilization demonstrating functional antagonism. When given alone, the compound did not elicit any responses, indicating the absence of intrinsic agonist activity. Compound 1 inhibited MIP-1alpha- and RANTES-induced migration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a dose-responsive manner. Selectivity testing against a panel of seven transmembrane domain receptors indicated that compound 1 is inactive on a number of receptors at concentrations up to 10 microM. This is the first description of CCR1 receptor antagonists that may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases involving MIP-1alpha, RANTES, and CCR1.</p>

                    <h2>Monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 is a functional ligand for CC chemokine receptors 1 and 2B.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The CC chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3) activates human monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. MCP-3 has been reported to induce [Ca2+]i changes in cells transfected with the monocyte-selective MCP-1 receptor 2B (CC CKR2B) and competes for 125I-MCP-1 binding on CC CKR2B, suggesting that it may mediate monocyte responses to MCP-3. However, we now show that MCP-3 is a ligand and potent agonist for the macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha)/regulated on activation, normal T expressed, and secreted protein (RANTES) receptor CC CKR1 (rank order for [Ca2+]i changes = MIP-1 alpha > MCP-3 > RANTES), which is expressed in monocytes > neutrophils > eosinophils. 125I-MCP-3 bound directly to CC CKR1 and CC CKR2B (Ki = 8 and 7 nM, respectively). Binding to CC CKR1 was competed by all CC chemokines tested except MCP-1. In contrast, binding to CC CKR2B was competed only by MCP-3 and MCP-1. Both MCP-1 and MCP-3 were equipotent agonists (EC50 = 10 nM for [Ca2+]i changes). Thus, MCP-3 is a functional ligand for both CC CKR1 and CC CKR2B, which otherwise have distinct selectivities for CC chemokines. These data suggest that monocyte responses to MCP-3 could be mediated by both CC CKR2B and CC CKR1, whereas eosinophil responses to MCP-3 could be mediated by CC CKR1.</p>

                    <h2>Selective binding of the truncated form of the chemokine CKbeta8 (25-99) to CC chemokine receptor 1(CCR1).</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical pharmacology; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Human CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) has been proposed as a receptor for CKbeta8. To obtain conclusive evidence, binding-displacement studies of 125I-CKbeta8 (25-99) were performed on membranes of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human CCR1. The Ic50 for displacement of 125I-CKbeta8 (25-99) with CKbeta8 (25-99) was 0.22 nM. The longer forms of CKbeta8 (24-99 and 1-99) also displaced 125I-CKbeta8, with Ic50 values of 6.5 and 16 nM, respectively. Displacement profiles of 125I-CKbeta8 (25-99) on freshly prepared human monocytes indicated that CCR1 was the major receptor for CKbeta8. We conclude that CCR1 is a receptor for different-length CKbeta8 and that CKbeta8 (25-99) has a similar affinity for CCR1 as macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha). The longer variants of CKbeta8 are significantly less potent than CKbeta8 (25-99) and MIP-1a on CCR1 and monocytes (P < 0.05).</p>

                    <h2>Differential effects of leukotactin-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha on neutrophils mediated by CCR1.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950); 1999</h3>
                    <p>The human CC chemokine leukotactin-1 (Lkn-1) is both a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes and a potent agonist for CCR1 and CCR3. However, human neutrophils do not migrate when the cells are stimulated with other human CC chemokines, such as human macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (hMIP-1 alpha) and eotaxin, which also use the CCR1 and CCR3 as their receptors. In this report, we demonstrate that while hMIP-1 alpha induced a negligible level of calcium flux and chemotaxis, Lkn-1 produced a high level of calcium flux and chemotaxis in human neutrophils. Lkn-1 cross-desensitized hMIP-1 alpha-induced calcium flux, but hMIP-1 alpha had little effect on the Lkn-1-induced response in human neutrophils. The same pattern was observed in peritoneal neutrophils from wild-type mice, whereas neutrophils from CCR1-/- mice failed to respond to either MIP-1 alpha or Lkn-1. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of receptor for both hMIP-1 alpha and Lkn-1 on human neutrophils with dissociation constants (Kd) of 3.2 nM and 1.1 nM, respectively. We conclude that CCR1 is a receptor mediating responses to both MIP-1 alpha and Lkn-1 on neutrophils and produces different biological responses depending on the ligand bound.</p>

                    <h2>Monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP3) interacts with multiple leukocyte receptors. C-C CKR1, a receptor for macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha/Rantes, is also a functional receptor for MCP3.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP3) is recently identified and molecularly cloned C-C chemokine that is chemotactic for and activates a great variety of inflammatory cell types. MCP3 has been reported to interact with several C-C chemokine receptors, which can be simultaneously or selectively expressed on leukocyte subpopulations. In order to isolate receptor(s) for MCP3, a cDNA library was constructed using mRNA from a human NK-like cell line, YT. These cells showed high affinity binding sites for 125I-MCP3 and migrated in response to MCP3. A chemokine receptor cDNA clone, designated YT4, was sequenced and found to be identical to the known C-C CKR1 or macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP1 alpha)/Rantes receptor. YT4 cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, and stable transfectants were prepared using the embryonic kidney cell line 293. The transfectants (YT4/293) showed high affinity binding for 125I-MCP3 in addition to specifically binding 125I-MIP1 alpha and 125I-Rantes. All three C-C chemokines were able to cross-compete for binding sites on YT4/293 cells and induced directional migration of YT4/293 cells in vitro, with MCP3 being the most potent chemoattractant. MCP3, MIP1 alpha, and Rantes were equally able to cross-attenuate the migratory response of YT4/293 cells to one another. In contrast, MCP1 and MIP1 beta had very limited capacity to compete for MCP3 binding on YT4/293 cells and had only a minor attenuating effect on MCP3-induced migration. Since MCP3 has been reported to use MCP1 receptor(s), our results with transfected 293 cells expressing only C-C CKR1 clearly establish that C-C CKR1 is also a functional receptor for MCP3.</p>
