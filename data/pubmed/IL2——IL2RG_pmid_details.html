                    <h2>Natural, proteolytic release of a soluble form of human IL-15 receptor alpha-chain that behaves as a specific, high affinity IL-15 antagonist.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950); 2004</h3>
                    <p>IL-15 and IL-2 are two structurally and functionally related cytokines whose high affinity receptors share the IL-2R beta-chain and gamma-chain in association with IL-15R alpha-chain (IL-15R alpha) or IL-2R alpha-chain, respectively. Whereas IL-2 action seems restricted to the adaptative T cells, IL-15 appears to be crucial for the function of the innate immune responses, and the pleiotropic expression of IL-15 and IL-15R alpha hints at a much broader role for the IL-15 system in multiple cell types and tissues. In this report, using a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay, we show the existence of a soluble form of human IL-15R alpha (sIL-15R alpha) that arises from proteolytic shedding of the membrane-anchored receptor. This soluble receptor is spontaneously released from IL-15R alpha-expressing human cell lines as well as from IL-15R alpha transfected COS-7 cells. This release is strongly induced by PMA and ionomycin, and to a lesser extent by IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. The size of sIL-15R alpha (42 kDa), together with the analysis of deletion mutants in the ectodomain of IL-15R alpha, indicates the existence of cleavage sites that are proximal to the plasma membrane. Whereas shedding induced by PMA was abrogated by the synthetic matrix metalloproteinases inhibitor GM6001, the spontaneous shedding was not, indicating the occurrence of at least two distinct proteolytic mechanisms. The sIL-15R alpha displayed high affinity for IL-15 and behaved as a potent and specific inhibitor of IL-15 binding to the membrane receptor, and of IL-15-induced cell proliferation (IC(50) in the range from 3 to 20 pM). These results suggest that IL-15R alpha shedding may play important immunoregulatory functions.</p>

                    <h2>The first alpha helix of interleukin (IL)-2 folds as a homotetramer, acts as an agonist of the IL-2 receptor beta chain, and induces lymphokine-activated killer cells.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of experimental medicine; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Interleukin (IL)-2 interacts with two types of functional receptors (IL-2Ralphabetagamma and IL-2Rbetagamma) and acts on a broad range of target cells involved in inflammatory reactions and immune responses. For the first time, we show that a chemically synthesized fragment of the IL-2 sequence can fold into a molecule mimicking the quaternary structure of a hemopoietin. Indeed, peptide p1-30 (containing amino acids 1-30, covering the entire alpha helix A of IL-2) spontaneously folds into an alpha-helical homotetramer and stimulates the growth of T cell lines expressing human IL-2Rbeta, whereas shorter versions of the peptide lack helical structure and are inactive. We also demonstrate that this neocytokine interacts with a previously undescribed dimeric form of IL-2Rbeta. In agreement with its binding to IL-2Rbeta, p1-30 activates Shc and p56(lck) but unlike IL-2, fails to activate Janus kinase (Jak)1, Jak3, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). Unexpectedly, we also show that p1-30 activates Tyk2, thus suggesting that IL-2Rbeta may bind to different Jaks depending on its oligomerization. At the cellular level, p1-30 induces lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and preferentially activates CD8(low) lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which constitutively express IL-2Rbeta. A significant interferon gamma production is also detected after p1-30 stimulation. A mutant form of p1-30 (Asp20-->Lys), which is likely unable to induce vascular leak syndrome, remains capable of generating LAK cells, like the original p1-30 peptide. Altogether, our data suggest that p1-30 has therapeutic potential.</p>

                    <h2>Soluble IL-2 receptor beta and gamma subunits: ligand binding and cooperativity.</h2>
                    <h3>European cytokine network; 1994</h3>
                    <p>Biologically relevant interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2Rs) are present in two affinity states on responsive cells. High affinity receptors (HAR) apparently exist as heterotrimers (alpha, beta and gamma) while the other functional complex, the intermediate affinity receptor (IAR), is comprised of beta and gamma chains. The mechanisms by which the beta and gamma subunits contribute the formation of HAR and IAR are still unclear. Soluble forms of the beta and gamma chains were cloned, epitope-tagged, expressed in insect cells and purified. IL-2 binding and neutralization of IL-2 bioactivity by beta and gamma extracellular domains (ectodomains) was analyzed by several biochemical and biological approaches. The results indicate that beta clearly binds IL-2 with low affinity (KI-KD = 3 microM) whereas gamma binding is detectable, but of very low affinity (apparent KI > 15 microM) in the absence of beta. Interestingly, combinations of beta and gamma ectodomains interact to bind IL-2 with higher affinity and greater stability than either chain alone. An apparent stable binding complex is formed when beta, gamma, and IL-2 are combined. Ligand binding by the beta and gamma chains in solution is specific for IL-2 and is of sufficient affinity and stability to effectively neutralize IL-2 in biological assays (binding IC50 = biological IC50). Direct analyses of binding kinetics by surface plasmon resonance reveals that the increased affinity and biological neutralizing ability of beta gamma, as compared to beta, is due to a very slow dissociation rate contributed by the gamma ectodomain. While IL-2R beta and gamma cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains are not essential for interactive binding of IL-2, they may contribute to IL2 binding affinity. The recognition and association of IL-2 by the beta gamma IAR appears to be contributed primarily by the beta chain while the stability and dissociation is likely dominated by the gamma chain. It is anticipated that the gamma subunit functions in a similar manner when participating in high affinity IL-4 and IL-7 binding.</p>
