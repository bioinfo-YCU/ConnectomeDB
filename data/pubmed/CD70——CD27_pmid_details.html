The biologic activity of this Ab-defined cell surface molecule on lymphocytes has not been established. Therefore, in an effort to understand the function of the CD70 protein, a mAb defining the CD70 Ag was used to isolate by expression cloning the cDNA responsible for the CD70 molecule.

                    <h3>International immunology; 1994</h3>
                    <p>The recently identified CD27 ligand (L) is a type II transmembrane molecule with significant structural homology to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, TNF-beta, lymphotoxin beta, CD40L, and CD30L. Using a CD27L specific mAb we examined the tissue distribution of the molecule, and found its expression to be restricted to B cells in occasional germinal centers, stromal cells in the thymic medulla, and scattered T cells in tonsils, skin and gut. As the limited expression of CD27L closely resembled the reported distribution of the activation antigen CD70, we tested whether CD70 represents the human CD27L. CD70 mAb were found to react with CD27L-expressing transfected mouse fibroblasts. Moreover a number of CD70 mAb could specifically interfere with the cellular binding of CD27L mAb. Thus, CD70 is identical to the human CD27L.</p>

                    <h3>Leukemia & lymphoma; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Members of the Tumour Necrosis Factor-Receptor (TNFR) family play an essential role in the control of lymphoid cell growth and differentiation. The ligand of one of its lymphoid-specific members, CD27, was recently characterized as CD70, a type II transmembrane molecule with homology to TNF that is expressed on activated T and B cells. Ligation of CD27 by its natural ligand generates a potent costimulatory signal for cytokine production and proliferation of activated T cells. In contrast to normal B cells, where CD27 expression is confined to germinal centre cells and to a small subset of circulating B lymphocytes, CD27 expression is found on a large array of distinct B-cell neoplasia. Here, we review recent data on the expression and function of TNFR family members on normal and malignant lymphocytes and propose a role for CD27-CD70 interaction in B-cell development.</p>

                    <p>The differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into mature blood cell lineages is tightly regulated. Here we report that CD27, which is expressed on stem and early progenitor cells in bone marrow, can be important in this process. Deletion of CD27 increased the myeloid colony-forming potential of stem and early progenitor cells and enhanced B lymphoid reconstitutive capacity in competitive transplantation experiments. Conversely, stimulation of CD27(+) progenitor cells with CD70, the unique ligand for CD27, inhibited colony-forming potential in vitro and lymphocyte outgrowth in vivo. As CD70 is expressed only on activated immune cells, we suggest that CD27 triggering on early progenitor cells provides a negative feedback signal to leukocyte differentiation during immune activation.</p>

                    <h2>CD27-CD70 interactions regulate B-cell activation by T cells.</h2>
                    <h3>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; 1995</h3>
                    <p>CD27, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, binds to its ligand CD70, a member of the TNF family, and subsequently induces T-cell costimulation and B-cell activation. CD27 is expressed on resting T and B cells, whereas CD70 is expressed on activated T and B cells. Utilizing transfected murine pre-B-cell lines expressing human CD27 or CD70, we have examined the effect of such transfectant cells on human B-cell IgG production and B-cell proliferation. We show that the addition of CD27-transfected cells to a T-cell-dependent, pokeweed mitogen-driven B-cell IgG synthesis system resulted in marked inhibition of IgG production, whereas the addition of CD70-transfected cells enhanced IgG production. The inhibition and enhancement of pokeweed mitogen-driven IgG production by CD27 and CD70 transfectants were abrogated by pretreatment with anti-CD27 and anti-CD70 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. In contrast, little or no inhibition of IgG production and B-cell proliferation was noted with CD27-transfected cells or either anti-CD27 or CD70 monoclonal antibody in a T-cell-independent Staphylococcus aureus/interleukin 2-driven B-cell activation system. In this same system CD70-transfected cells enhanced B-cell IgG production and B-cell proliferation, and this enhancement could be gradually abrogated by addition of increasing numbers of CD27-transfected cells. These results clearly demonstrate that interactions among subsets of T cells expressing CD27 and CD70 play a key role in regulating B-cell activation and immunoglobulin synthesis.</p>

                    <h2>CD27/CD70 interaction augments IgE secretion by promoting the differentiation of memory B cells into plasma cells.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950); 1998</h3>
                    <p>The induction of IgE switching in B cells requires several signals given by cytokines and cell contact-delivered signals. Here, we investigated the role of CD27/CD70 interaction in B cell IgE synthesis. The addition of CD27 ligand (CD70) transfectants to B cell cultures increased the IgE synthesis synergistically in the presence of IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb (anti-CD40). The effect of CD70 transfectants was dose dependent and was completely blocked by anti-CD70 mAb. CD27+ B cells had the ability to produce IgE, which was increased by contact with CD70 transfectants, whereas CD27- B cells did not produce IgE. CD27/CD70 interaction enhanced B cell proliferation in the presence of IL-4 or IL-4 plus anti-CD40. The augmentation of B cell proliferation by CD70 transfectants was apparent in CD27+ B cells, but was mild in CD27- B cells. The helper activity for IgE synthesis by the CD27/CD70 interaction did not contribute to the enhancement of germline epsilon transcripts. Flow cytometric and morphological analyses demonstrated that the addition of CD70 transfectants to B cell cultures remarkably promoted differentiation into plasma cells in the presence of IL-4 and CD40 signaling. Finally, CD27 cross-linking resulted in the up-regulation of positive regulatory domain I-binding factor-1. Taken together, our findings indicate that signaling via CD27 on B cells induces IgE synthesis, in cooperation with IL-4 and CD40 signaling, by promoting the generation of plasma cells through up-regulation of positive regulatory domain I-binding factor-1.</p>

                    <h2>Synergistic augmentative effect of interleukin-10 and CD27/CD70 interactions on B-cell immunoglobulin synthesis.</h2>
                    <h3>Immunology; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a potent cytokine that regulates immunoglobulin synthesis by B cells. CD27/CD70 interactions by direct cell-to-cell contact are also needed to produce substantial amounts of immunoglobulin. We have investigated the effects of IL-10 and CD27/CD70 interactions on the immunoglobulin synthesis. In the presence of IL-10 stimulation, the production of IgG, IgM and IgA was increased synergistically by the addition of CD27 ligand (CD70)-transfectants in a dose-dependent manner, which was completely blocked by anti-CD70 monoclonal antibody. In contrast, CD70-transfectants additively enhanced the immunoglobulin production in the presence of IL-2, IL-4, or IL-6. The synergistic enhancement of the immunoglobulin production by IL-10 and CD70-transfectants was remarkable in highly purified CD27+ B cells, but there was no immunoglobulin production in CD27- B cells. Furthermore, by the addition of CD70-transfectants, the synthesis of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 was also enhanced in the presence of IL-10. On the other hand, IL-10 diminished CD27 expression in B cells. B-cell proliferation was augmented by CD70-transfectants with IL-10 or IL-10 plus IL-2. The addition of IL-2 further augmented the immunoglobulin production which was synergistically enhanced by IL-10 and CD27 triggering. Taken together, the co-operative response to IL-10 and CD27/CD70 interactions regulates B-cell immunoglobulin production.</p>
