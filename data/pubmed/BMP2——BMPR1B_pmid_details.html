                    <h2>Bone morphogenetic proteins, their antagonists, and the skeleton.</h2>
                    <h3>Endocrine reviews; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Skeletal homeostasis is determined by systemic hormones and local factors. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are unique because they induce the differentiation of mesenchymal cells toward cells of the osteoblastic lineage and also enhance the differentiated function of the osteoblast. However, the activity of BMPs needs to be tempered by intracellular and extracellular antagonists. BMPs bind to specific receptors and signal by phosphorylating the cytoplasmic proteins mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad) 1 and 5, which form heterodimers with Smad 4, and after nuclear translocation regulate transcription. BMP antagonists can be categorized as pseudoreceptors that compete with signaling receptors, inhibitory Smads that block signaling, intracellular binding proteins that bind Smad 1 and 5, and factors that induce ubiquitination and proteolysis of signaling Smads. In addition, a large number of extracellular proteins that bind BMPs and prevent their binding to signaling receptors have emerged. They are the components of the Spemann organizer, noggin, chordin, and follistatin, members of the Dan/Cerberus family, and twisted gastrulation. The antagonists tend to be specific for BMPs and are regulated by BMPs, indicating the existence and need of local feedback mechanisms to temper BMP cellular activities.</p>

                    <h2>A mammalian serine/threonine kinase receptor specifically binds BMP-2 and BMP-4.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical and biophysical research communications; 1994</h3>
                    <p>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a class of related growth and differentiation factors within the TGF-beta superfamily of proteins which are known to induce cartilage and bone formation in adult animals and to be involved in many inductive events throughout embryonic development. Here we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of a mammalian receptor, CFK-43a, which specifically binds BMP-2 and BMP-4. This molecule is a member of the serine/threonine kinase receptor family which includes receptors for other TGF-beta superfamily members. CFK-43a binds other BMP family members with lower affinity, but does not bind TGF-beta. During embryogenesis, in situ hybridization analysis indicates that CFK-43a mRNA is localized in developing skeletal tissues in a complementary fashion to the transcripts for its ligands.</p>

                    <h2>Endoglin is an accessory protein that interacts with the signaling receptor complex of multiple members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1999</h3>
                    <p>Endoglin (CD105) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that binds transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and -beta3, and coprecipitates with the Ser/Thr kinase signaling receptor complex by affinity labeling of endothelial and leukemic cells. The present study shows that in addition to TGF-beta1 and -beta3, endoglin interacts with activin-A, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7, and BMP-2 but requires coexpression of the respective ligand binding kinase receptor for this association. Endoglin cannot bind ligands on its own and does not alter binding to the kinase receptors. It binds TGF-beta1 and -beta3 by associating with the TGF-beta type II receptor and interacts with activin-A and BMP-7 via activin type II receptors, ActRII and ActRIIB, regardless of which type I receptor partner is coexpressed. However, endoglin binds BMP-2 by interacting with the ligand binding type I receptors, ALK3 and ALK6. The formation of heteromeric signaling complexes was not altered by the presence of endoglin, although it was coprecipitated with these complexes. Endoglin did not interact with BMP-7 through complexes containing the BMP type II receptor, demonstrating specificity of its action. Our data suggest that endoglin is an accessory protein of multiple kinase receptor complexes of the TGF-beta superfamily.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular recognition of BMP-2 and BMP receptor IA.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature structural & molecular biology; 2004</h3>
                    <p>Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and other members of the TGF-beta superfamily regulate the development, maintenance and regeneration of tissues and organs. Binding epitopes for these extracellular signaling proteins have been defined, but hot spots specifying binding affinity and specificity have so far not been identified. In this study, mutational and structural analyses show that epitopes of BMP-2 and the BRIA receptor form a new type of protein-protein interface. The main chain atoms of Leu 51 and Asp53 of BMP-2 represent a hot spot of binding to BRIA. The BMP-2 variant L51P was deficient in type I receptor binding only, whereas its overall structure and its binding to type II receptors and modulator proteins, such as noggin, were unchanged. Thus, the L51P substitution converts BMP-2 into a receptor-inactive inhibitor of noggin. These results are relevant for other proteins of the TGF-beta superfamily and provide useful clues for structure-based drug design.</p>
