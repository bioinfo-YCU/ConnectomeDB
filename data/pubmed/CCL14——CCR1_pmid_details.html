                    <h2>Identification of C-C chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) as the monocyte hemofiltrate C-C chemokine (HCC)-1 receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of experimental medicine; 1998</h3>
                    <p>Hemofiltrate C-C chemokine (HCC)-1 is a recently cloned C-C chemokine that is structurally similar to macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha. Unlike most chemokines, it is constitutively secreted by tissues and is present at high concentrations in normal human plasma. Also atypical for chemokines, HCC-1 is reported not to be chemotactic for leukocytes. In this paper, we have investigated the chemokine receptor usage and downstream signaling pathways of HCC-1. Cross-desensitization experiments using THP-1 cells suggested that HCC-1 and MIP-1alpha activated the same receptor. Experiments using a panel of cloned chemokine receptors revealed that HCC-1 specifically activated C-C chemokine receptor (CCR)1, but not closely related receptors, including CCR5. HCC-1 competed with MIP-1alpha for binding to CCR1-transfected cells, but with a markedly reduced affinity (IC50 = 93 nM versus 1.3 nM for MIP-1alpha). Similarly, HCC-1 was less potent than MIP-1alpha in inducing inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in CCR1-transfected cells. HCC-1 induced chemotaxis of freshly isolated human monocytes, THP-1 cells, and CCR1-transfected cells, and the optimal concentration for cell migration (100 nM) was approximately 100-fold lower than that of MIP-1alpha (1 nM). These data demonstrate that HCC-1 is a chemoattractant and identify CCR1 as a functional HCC-1 receptor on human monocytes.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological characterization of the chemokine receptor, hCCR1 in a stable transfectant and differentiated HL-60 cells: antagonism of hCCR1 activation by MIP-1beta.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2002</h3>
                    <p>C-C chemokine receptor-1 (CCR1) has been implicated in mediating a variety of inflammatory conditions including multiple sclerosis and organ rejection. Although originally referred to as the MIP-1alpha/RANTES receptor, CCR1 is quite promiscuous and can be activated by numerous chemokines. We used radioligand binding and [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays in membranes from a cell line transfected to express CCR1 (Ba/F3-hCCR1) to characterize a panel of chemokines (HCC-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MIP-1delta, MPIF-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and RANTES) as CCR1 ligands. In this recombinant model, these chemokines displaced 125I-MIP-1alpha with a wide range of potencies and, with the exception of MCP-2, acted as full agonists in stimulating [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange. We then assessed the utility of HL-60 cells cultured with known differentiating agents (PMA, DMSO, dibutyryl-cAMP or retinoic acid) for investigating CCR1 pharmacology. In [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, membranes from cells cultured with retinoic acid (4-6 days) were the most responsive to activation by MIP-1alpha and MPIF-1. FACS analysis and comparative pharmacology confirmed that these activities were mediated by CCR1. Using [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, intracellular calcium flux and/or whole cell chemotaxis assays in HL-60(Rx) cells, we validated that MIP-1alpha was the most potent CCR1 ligand (MIP-1alpha>MPIF-1>RANTES>or=MIP-1beta) although the ligands differed in their efficacy as agonists. MPIF-1 was the more efficacious (MPIF-1>RANTES=MIP-1alpha>>MIP-1beta). 125I-MIP-1beta binding in Ba/F3-hCCR1 and HL-60(Rx) membranes was competitively displaced by MIP-1alpha, MPIF-1 and MIP-1beta. The binding K(i) for these chemokines with 125I-MIP-1beta were essentially identical in the two membrane systems. Lastly, MIP-1beta antagonized [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange, Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis in HL-60(Rx) cells in response to robust agonists such as MIP-1alpha, RANTES and MPIF-1. Based on our results, we propose that MIP-1beta could function as an endogenous inhibitor of CCR1 function.</p>

                    <h2>Natural proteolytic processing of hemofiltrate CC chemokine 1 generates a potent CC chemokine receptor (CCR)1 and CCR5 agonist with anti-HIV properties.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of experimental medicine; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Hemofiltrate CC chemokine (HCC)-1 is a recently described human chemokine that is constitutively expressed in numerous tissues and is present at high concentrations in normal plasma. Using a cell line expressing CC chemokine receptor (CCR)5 as a bioassay, we isolated from human hemofiltrate an HCC-1 variant lacking the first eight amino acids. HCC-1[9-74] was a potent agonist of CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 and promoted calcium flux and chemotaxis of T lymphoblasts, monocytes, and eosinophils. It also blocked entry of HIV-1 strains using CCR5 as coreceptor. Limited tryptic digestion of HCC-1 generated the active variant. Conditioned media from several tumor cell lines activated HCC-1 with a high efficiency, and this activity could be inhibited by serine protease inhibitors. Our results indicate that HCC-1 represents a nonfunctional precursor that can be rapidly converted to the active chemokine by proteolytic processing. This process represents an additional mechanism by which tumor cells might generate chemoattractant molecules and recruit inflammatory cells. It might also affect HIV-1 replication in infected individuals and play an important role in AIDS pathogenesis.</p>
