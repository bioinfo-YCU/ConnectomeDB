                    <h2>The chemotactic receptor for human C5a anaphylatoxin.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature; 1991</h3>
                    <p>Host defence and inflammatory responses are controlled and amplified by receptor-mediated events often initiated by a chemotactic factor that directs the approach of phagocytic cells. Complement receptors CR1 and CR3 are responsible for the phagocytic and adhesive properties of neutrophils, whereas the C5a receptor mediates the pro-inflammatory and chemotactic actions of the complement anaphylatoxin C5a. In addition to stimulating chemotaxis, granule enzyme release and superoxide anion production, this receptor stimulates upregulation of expression and activity of the adhesion molecule MAC-1, and of CR1, and a decrease in cell-surface glycoprotein 100MEL-14 on neutrophils. In vivo, the C5a receptor may participate in anaphylactoid and septic shock. The human C5a receptor was cloned from U937 and HL-60 cells and identified by high affinity binding when expressed in COS-7 cells. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the receptor reveals the expected motifs befitting its interaction with cellular GTP-binding proteins.</p>

                    <h2>Pharmacological characterization of antagonists of the C5a receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 1999</h3>
                    <p>1. Potent and highly selective small molecule antagonists have recently been developed by us for C5a receptors (C5aR) on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). In this study we compared a new cyclic antagonist, F-[OPdChaWR], with an acyclic derivative, MeFKPdChaWr, for their capacities to bind to C5aR on human PMN and human umbilical artery membranes. We also compared their inhibition of myeloperoxidase (MPO) secretion from human PMNs and their inhibition of human umbilical artery contraction induced by human recombinant C5a. 2. In both PMNs and umbilical artery, the cyclic and acyclic C5a antagonists displayed insurmountable antagonism against C5a. There were differences in selectivities for the C5aR with F-[OPdChaWR] (pKb 8.64+/-0.21) being 30 times more potent than MeFKPdChaWr (pKb 7.16+/-0.11, P<0.05) in PMNs, but of similar potency (pKb 8.19+/-0.38 vs pKb 8.28+/-0.29, respectively) in umbilical artery. This trend was also reflected in their relative binding affinities, both antagonists having similar affinities (-logIC50 values) for C5aR in umbilical artery membranes (F-[OPdChaWR], 7.00+/-0.46; MeFKPdChaWr, 7.23+/-0.17), whereas in PMN membranes the C5aR affinity of the cycle F-[OPdChaWR] (7.05+/-0. 06) was four times higher than that of acyclic MeFKPdChaWr (6.43+/-0. 24, P<0.05). 3. In summary, the results reveal that these antagonists are insurmountable in nature against C5a for C5aR on at least two human cell types, and the differences in relative receptor binding affinities and antagonistic potencies against C5a are consistent with differences in receptors within these cell types. The nature of these differences is yet to be elucidated.</p>

                    <h2>S19 ribosomal protein cross-linked dimer causes monocyte-predominant infiltration by means of molecular mimicry to complement C5a.</h2>
                    <h3>Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology; 1998</h3>
                    <p>S19 ribosomal protein is a component of the protein-producing machinery, ribosome. When recombinant S19 proteins were cross-linked intermolecularly by plasma transglutaminase (coagulation factor XIIIa), this homodimer newly exhibited monocyte chemotactic activity. This effect was specific to monocytes. The S19 protein homodimer shared the immunoreactivity with the complement-derived chemotactic factor, component 5a (C5a). Monocytes pretreated with an anti-C5a receptor antibody or with a synthetic C5a receptor antagonist responded poorly in chemotaxis to this homodimer. These data indicate that the S19 protein homodimer possesses a 3-dimensional structure similar to C5a in terms of the immunologic epitope and the receptor ligand, although homology between their primary structures is only 4%. In contrast, the S19 protein homodimer did not attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In addition, the homodimer inhibited a chemotactic response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to C5a in vitro and in vivo as a receptor antagonist. Furthermore, the S19 protein homodimer competitively inhibited the binding of radiolabeled C5a to polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The S19 protein homodimer with these opposite effects in the leukocyte chemotaxis seems to induce the monocyte/macrophage predominant infiltration in chronic inflammation.</p>

                    <h2>Comparative agonist/antagonist responses in mutant human C5a receptors define the ligand binding site.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2005</h3>
                    <p>The C terminus is responsible for all of the agonist activity of C5a at human C5a receptors (C5aRs). In this report we have mapped the ligand binding site on the C5aR using a series of agonist and antagonist peptide mimics of the C terminus of C5a as well as receptors mutated at putative interaction sites (Ile(116), Arg(175,) Arg(206), Glu(199), Asp(282), and Val(286)). Agonist peptide 1 (Phe-Lys-Pro-d-cyclohexylalanine-cyclohexylalanine-d-Arg) can be converted to an antagonist by substituting the bulkier Trp for cyclohexylalanine at position 5 (peptide 2). Conversely, mutation of C5aR transmembrane residue Ile(116) to the smaller Ala (I116A) makes the receptor respond to peptide 2 as an agonist (Gerber, B. O., Meng, E. C., Dotsch, V., Baranski, T. J., and Bourne, H. R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3394-3400). However, a potent cyclic hexapeptide antagonist, Phe-cyclo-[Orn-Pro-d-cyclohexylalanine-Trp-Arg] (peptide 3), derived from peptide 2 and which binds to the same receptor site, remains a full antagonist at I116AC5aR. This suggests that although the residue at position 5 might bind near to Ile(116), the latter is not essential for either activation or antagonism. Arg(206) and Arg(175) both appear to interact with the C-terminal carboxylate of C5a agonist peptides, suggesting a dynamic binding mechanism that may be a part of a receptor activation switch. Asp(282) has been previously shown to interact with the side chain of the C-terminal Arg residue, and Glu(199) may also interact with this side chain in both C5a and peptide mimics. Using these interactions to orient NMR-derived ligand structures in the binding site of C5aR, a new model of the interaction between peptide antagonists and the C5aR is presented.</p>

                    <h2>The orphan receptor C5L2 has high affinity binding sites for complement fragments C5a and C5a des-Arg(74).</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2002</h3>
                    <p>The substantial variations in the responses of cells to the anaphylatoxin C5a and its desarginated form, C5adR(74), suggest that more than one type of cell surface receptor for these ligands might exist. However, only a single receptor for C5a and C5adR(74), CD88, has been characterized to date. Here we report that the orphan receptor C5L2/gpr77, which shares 35% amino acid identity with CD88, binds C5a with high affinity but has a 10-fold higher affinity for C5adR(74) than CD88. C5L2 also has a moderate affinity for anaphylatoxin C3a, but cross-competition studies suggest that C3a binds to a distinct site from C5a. C4a was able to displace C3a, suggesting that C5L2, like the C3a receptor, may have a low binding affinity for this anaphylatoxin. Unlike CD88 and C3a receptor, C5L2 transfected into RBL-2H3 cells does not support degranulation or increases in intracellular [Ca(2+)] and is not rapidly internalized in response to ligand binding. However, ligation of C5L2 by anaphylatoxin did potentiate the degranulation response to cross-linkage of the high affinity IgE receptor by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. These results suggest that C5L2 is an anaphylatoxin-binding protein with unique ligand binding and signaling properties.</p>

                    <h2>Residues 21-30 within the extracellular N-terminal region of the C5a receptor represent a binding domain for the C5a anaphylatoxin.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1998</h3>
                    <p>The functions of the C5a anaphylatoxin are expressed through its interaction with a cell-surface receptor with seven transmembrane helices. The interaction of C5a with the receptor has been explained by a two-site model whereby recognition and effector sites on C5a bind, respectively, to recognition and effector domains on the receptor, leading to receptor activation (Chenoweth, D. E., and Hugli, T. E. (1980) Mol. Immunol. 17, 151-161. In addition, the extracellular N-terminal region of the C5a receptor has been implicated as the recognition domain for C5a, responsible for approximately 50% of the binding energy of the C5a-receptor complex (Mery, L., and Boulay, F. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 3457-3463; DeMartino, J. A., Van Riper, G., Siciliano, S. J., Molineaux, C. J., Konteatis, Z. D., Rosen, H., and Springer, M. S. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 14446-14450). In this work, the interactions of C5a with the N-terminal domain of the C5a receptor were examined by use of recombinant human C5a molecules and peptide fragments M1NSFN5YTTPD10YGHYD15DKDTL20DLNTP25VDKTS30NTLR(hC5aRF-1-34), acetyl-HYD15DKDTL20DLNTP25VDKTS30NTLR (hC5aRF-13-34), and acetyl-TL20DLNTP25VDKTS30N-amide (hC5aRF-19-31) derived from human C5a receptor. Binding induced resonance perturbations in the NMR spectra of the receptor fragments and the C5a molecules indicated that the isolated Nterminal domain or residues 1-34 of the C5a receptor retain specific binding to C5a and to a C5a analog devoid of the agonistic C-terminal tail in the intact C5a. Residues of C5a perturbed by the binding of the receptor peptides are localized within the helical core of the C5a structure, in agreement with the results from functional studies employing mutated C5a and intact receptor molecules. All three receptor peptides, hC5aRF-1-34, hC5aRF-13-34, and hC5aRF-19-31, responded to the binding of C5a through the 21-30 region containing either hydrophobic, polar, or positively charged residues such as Thr24, Pro25, Val26, Lys28, Thr29, and Ser30. The 21-30 segment of all three receptor fragments was found to have a partially folded conformation in solution, independent of residues 1-18. These results indicate that a short peptide sequence, or residues 21-30, of the C5a receptor N terminus may constitute the binding domain for the recognition site on C5a.</p>
