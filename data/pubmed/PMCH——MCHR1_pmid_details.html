                    <h2>Molecular characterization of the melanin-concentrating-hormone receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature; 1999</h3>
                    <p>Orphan G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are cloned proteins with structural characteristics common to the GPCRs but that bind unidentified ligands. Orphan GPCRs have been used as targets to identify novel transmitter molecules. Here we describe the isolation from brain extracts and the characterization of the natural ligand of a particular orphan GPCR (SLC-1) that is sequentially homologous to the somatostatin receptors. We show that the natural ligand of this receptor is the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). MCH is a cyclic peptide that regulates a variety of functions in the mammalian brain, in particular feeding behaviour. We demonstrate that nanomolar concentrations of MCH strongly activate SLC-1-related pathways through G(alpha)i and/or G(alpha)q proteins. We have analysed the tissue localization of the MCH receptor and find that it is expressed in several brain regions, in particular those involved in olfactory learning and reinforcement mechanisms, indicating that therapies targeting the MCH receptor should act on the neuronal regulation of food consumption.</p>

                    <h2>Melanin-concentrating hormone is the cognate ligand for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor SLC-1.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature; 1999</h3>
                    <p>The underlying causes of obesity are poorly understood but probably involve complex interactions between many neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems involved in the regulation of food intake and energy balance. Three pieces of evidence indicate that the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an important component of this system. First, MCH stimulates feeding when injected directly into rat brains; second, the messenger RNA for the MCH precursor is upregulated in the hypothalamus of genetically obese mice and in fasted animals; and third, mice lacking MCH eat less and are lean. MCH antagonists might, therefore, provide a treatment for obesity. However, the development of such molecules has been hampered because the identity of the MCH receptor has been unknown until now. Here we show that the 353-amino-acid human orphan G-protein-coupled receptor SLC-1 expressed in HEK293 cells binds MCH with sub-nanomolar affinity, and is stimulated by MCH to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and reduce forskolin-elevated cyclic AMP levels. We also show that SLC-1 messenger RNA and protein is expressed in the ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, consistent with a role for SLC-1 in mediating the effects of MCH on feeding.</p>

                    <h2>[125I]-S36057: a new and highly potent radioligand for the melanin-concentrating hormone receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Shortened, more stable and weakly hydrophobic analogues of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) were searched as candidates for radioiodination. Starting from the dodecapeptide MCH(6 - 17), we found that: (1) substitution of Tyr(13) by a Phe residue; (2) addition of a 3-iodo-Tyr residue at the N-terminus; and (3) addition of a hydrophilic spacer 8-amino-3,6-dioxyoctanoyl between the 3-iodo-Tyr and MCH(6 - 17) (compound S36057), led to an agonist more potent than MCH itself in stimulating [35S]-GTPgammaS binding at membranes from HEK293 cells stably expressing the human MCH receptor. Specific binding of [125I]-S36057 was found in HEK293 and CHO cell lines stably expressing the human MCH receptor. This radioligand recognized a similar number of binding sites (ca. 800 fmol mg(-1)) than [125I]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH. However, the K(D) for [125I]-S36057 obtained from saturation studies (0.037 nM) or from binding kinetics (0.046 nM) was at least 10 fold higher to that of [125I]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH (0.46 nM). Affinities determined for a series of MCH analogues were similar with both radioligands, S36057 being the most potent compound tested (K(i)=0.053 nM). Finally, [125I]-S36057 also potently labelled the MCH receptor in membranes from whole rat brain (K(D) 0.044 nM, B(max)=11 fmol mg(-1)). In conclusion, [125I]-S36057 is a more potent and more stable radioligand than [125I]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH that will represent a reliable tool for binding assays in the search of novel MCH ligands. It should also provide great help for autoradiographic studies of the MCH receptor distribution in the central nervous system.</p>

                    <h2>Short segment of human melanin-concentrating hormone that is sufficient for full activation of human melanin-concentrating hormone receptors 1 and 2.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemistry; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Human melanin-concentrating hormone (hMCH) is a potent but nonselective agonist at human melanin-concentrating hormone receptors 1 and 2 (hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R, respectively). To determine the structural features of this neuropeptide which are necessary for efficient binding to and activation of the receptors, Ala-substituted, open-chain, and truncated analogues were synthesized and tested in the binding assays in CHO cells expressing hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R, and in functional assays measuring the level of intracellular calcium mobilization in human HEK-293 cells expressing these receptors. A compound consisting merely of the cyclic core of hMCH with the Arg attached to the N-terminus of the disulfide ring was found to activate both hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R about as effectively as full-length hMCH. Thus, the sequence Arg-cyclo(S-S)(Cys-Met-Leu-Gly-Arg-Val-Tyr-Arg-Pro-Cys) appears to constitute the "active core" that is necessary for agonist potency at hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R. A potent and approximately 4-fold more selective agonist at hMCH-1R than at hMCH-2R is also reported.</p>

                    <h2>Synthesis and biological evaluation in vitro of a selective, high potency peptide agonist of human melanin-concentrating hormone action at human melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2002</h3>
                    <p>Human melanin-concentrating hormone (hMCH) is a nonselective natural ligand for the human melanin-concentrating hormone receptors: hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R. Similarly, the smaller peptide encompassing the disulfide ring and Arg(6) of hMCH, Ac-Arg(6)-cyclo(S-S)(Cys(7)-Met(8)-Leu(9)-Gly(10)-Arg(11)-Val(12)-Tyr(13)-Arg(14)-Pro(15)-Cys(16))-NH(2), Ac-hMCH(6-16)-NH(2), binds to and activates equally well both human MCH receptors present in the brain. To separate the physiological functions of hMCH-1R from those of hMCH-2R, new potent and hMCH-1R selective agonists are necessary. In the present study, analogs of Ac-hMCH(6-16)-NH(2) were prepared and tested in binding and functional assays on cells expressing the MCH receptors. In these peptides, Arg in position 6 was replaced with various d-amino acids and/or Gly in position 10 was substituted with various L-amino acids. Several of the new compounds turned out to be potent agonists at hMCH-1R with improved selectivity over hMCH-2R. For example, peptide 26 with d-Arg in place of L-Arg in position 6 and Asn in place of Gly in position 10, Ac-dArg(6)-cyclo(S-S)(Cys(7)-Met(8)-Leu(9)-Asn(10)-Arg(11)-Val(12)-Tyr(13)-Arg(14)-Pro(15)-Cys(16))-NH(2), was a potent hMCH-1R agonist (IC(50) = 0.5 nm, EC(50) = 47 nm) with more than 200-fold selectivity with respect to hMCH-2R. Apparently, these structural changes in positions 6 and 10 results in peptide conformations that allow for efficient interactions with hMCH-1R but are unfavorable for molecular recognition at hMCH-2R.</p>
