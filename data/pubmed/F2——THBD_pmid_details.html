                    <h2>Thrombomodulin as a model of molecular mechanisms that modulate protease specificity and function at the vessel surface.</h2>
                    <h3>FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology; 1995</h3>
                    <p>The protein C anticoagulant system generates an "on demand" physiologic anticoagulant response. The pathway is initiated when thrombin binds to the endothelial cell thrombin binding protein, thrombomodulin. The complex exhibits dramatically altered macromolecular specificity. It rapidly cleaves the protein C zymogen to form the anticoagulant, activated protein C. Complex formation between thrombin and thrombomodulin also prevents thrombin, the enzyme responsible for clot formation and a potent platelet activator, from being able to clot fibrinogen or to activate platelets. Structural, kinetic, and competition studies suggest that thrombomodulin blocks these clotting reactions by masking the binding sites for fibrinogen and the platelet thrombin receptor. Stimulation of protein C activation appears to occur through conformational changes in the extended binding pocket of thrombin. This prevents repulsive interactions with protein C that exist when the free enzyme attempts to dock with this substrate. In addition to protein-protein interactions, thrombomodulin has a covalently associated chondroitin sulfate moiety. Chondroitin sulfate binds to a basic surface on thrombin that is also involved in heparin interaction. The chondroitin sulfate enhances the affinity of thrombin for thrombomodulin approximately 10- to 20-fold, making thrombomodulin a more potent inhibitor of coagulation, altering thrombin's conformation and specificity, and accelerating thrombin inhibition by the serpin, antithrombin. These properties make thrombomodulin a molecular switch ideally suited to trigger an anticoagulant response when too much thrombin is generated. The importance of the system is documented by the clinical observation that patients deficient in protein C often die of massive thrombotic complications that can be reversed or prevented by infusion of protein C.</p>

                    <h2>TAFI, or plasma procarboxypeptidase B, couples the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades through the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>TAFI (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor) is a recently discovered plasma protein that can be activated by thrombin-catalyzed proteolysis to a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme that inhibits fibrinolysis. This work shows that the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, rather than free thrombin, is the most likely physiologic activator. Thrombomodulin increases the catalytic efficiency of the reaction by a factor of 1250, an effect expressed almost exclusively through an increase in kcat. The kinetics of the reaction conform to a model whereby thrombin can interact with either TAFI (Km = 1.0 microM) or thrombomodulin (Kd = 8.6 nM), and either binary complex so formed can then interact with the third component to form the ternary thrombin-thrombomodulin-TAFI complex from which activated TAFI is produced with kcat = 1.2 s-1. This work also shows that activated TAFI down-regulates tPA-induced fibrinolysis half-maximally at a concentration of 1.0 nM in a system of purified components. This concentration of TAFI is about 2% of the level of the zymogen in plasma, which indicates that ample activated TAFI could be generated to very significantly modulate fibrinolysis in vivo. Therefore, TAFI in vitro and possibly in vivo defines an explicit molecular connection between the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades, such that expression of activity in the former down-regulates the activity of the latter.</p>

                    <h2>Two different proteins that compete for binding to thrombin have opposite kinetic and thermodynamic profiles.</h2>
                    <h3>Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society; 2004</h3>
                    <p>Thrombin binds thrombomodulin (TM) at anion binding exosite 1, an allosteric site far from the thrombin active site. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been isolated that competes with TM for binding to thrombin. Complete binding kinetic and thermodynamic profiles for these two protein-protein interactions have been generated. Binding kinetics were measured by Biacore. Although both interactions have similar K(D)s, TM binding is rapid and reversible while binding of the mAb is slow and nearly irreversible. The enthalpic contribution to the DeltaG(bind) was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry and van't Hoff analysis. The contribution to the DeltaG(bind) from electrostatic steering was assessed from the dependence of the k(a) on ionic strength. Release of solvent H(2)O molecules from the interface was assessed by monitoring the decrease in amide solvent accessibility at the interface upon protein-protein binding. The mAb binding is enthalpy driven and has a slow k(d). TM binding appears to be entropy driven and has a fast k(a). The favorable entropy of the thrombin-TM interaction seems to be derived from electrostatic steering and a contribution from solvent release. The two interactions have remarkably different thermodynamic driving forces for competing reactions. The possibility that optimization of binding kinetics for a particular function may be reflected in different thermodynamic driving forces is discussed.</p>
