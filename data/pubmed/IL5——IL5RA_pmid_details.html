                    <h2>Proteasomal regulation of betac signaling reveals a novel mechanism for cytokine receptor heterotypic desensitization.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of clinical investigation; 2001</h3>
                    <p>IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF are hematopoietic cytokines that are key mediators of the allergic inflammatory response. The receptors for these three cytokines consist of a cytokine-specific alpha (Ralpha) chain and a shared common beta (betac) chain. Herein, we demonstrate that agonistic ligation of these receptor subunits rapidly induces proteasomal degradation of the betac, but not the Ralpha, cytoplasmic domain, resulting in termination of signal transduction and yielding a truncated betac isoform ligated to the Ralpha subunit. Proteasomal degradation of the betac cytoplasmic domain was also a prerequisite for endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the ligated receptor subunits. Moreover, proteasome-dependent termination of signaling induced by one betac-engaging cytokine resulted in cellular desensitization to signal transduction by subsequent stimulation with another betac-engaging cytokine. These data provide the first evidence for ligand-dependent proteasomal degradation of the betac cytoplasmic domain, and they establish a novel mechanism for heterotypic desensitization of shared cytokine receptor signaling.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular cloning and expression of the human interleukin 5 receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of experimental medicine; 1992</h3>
                    <p>Human interleukin 5 (IL-5) plays an important role in proliferation and differentiation of human eosinophils. We report the isolation of cDNA clones from cDNA libraries of human eosinophils by using murine IL-5 receptor alpha chain cDNA as a probe. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence indicated that the human IL-5 receptor has approximately 70% amino acid sequence homology with the murine IL-5 receptor and retains features common to the cytokine receptor superfamily. One cDNA clone encodes a glycoprotein of 420 amino acids (Mr 47,670) with an NH2-terminal hydrophobic region (20 amino acids), a glycosylated extracellular domain (324 amino acids), a transmembrane domain (21 amino acids), and a cytoplasmic domain (55 amino acids). Another cDNA encodes only the extracellular domain of this receptor molecule. Other cDNA clones encode molecules having diversified cytoplasmic domains. COS7 cells transfected with the cDNA expressed a approximately 60-kD protein and bound IL-5 with a single class of affinity (Kd = 250-590 pM). The Kd values were similar to that observed in normal human eosinophils. In contrast to the murine 60-kD alpha chain, which binds IL-5 with low affinity (Kd = approximately 10 nM), the human alpha chain homologue can bind IL-5 with much higher affinity by itself. RNA blot analysis of human cells demonstrated two transcripts (approximately 5.3 and 1.4 kb). Both of them were expressed in normal human eosinophils and in erythroleukemic cell line TF-1, which responds to IL-5. The human IL-5 receptor characterized in this paper is essential for signal transduction, because expression of this molecule in murine IL-3-dependent cell line FDC-P1 allowed these cells to proliferate in response to IL-5.</p>

                    <h2>Binding interactions of human interleukin 5 with its receptor alpha subunit. Large scale production, structural, and functional studies of Drosophila-expressed recombinant proteins.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Human interleukin 5 (hIL5) and soluble forms of its receptor alpha subunit were expressed in Drosophila cells and purified to homogeneity, allowing a detailed structural and functional analysis. B cell proliferation confirmed that the hIL5 was biologically active. Deglycosylated hIL5 remained active, while similarly deglycosylated receptor alpha subunit lost activity. The crystal structure of the deglycosylated hIL5 was determined to 2.6-A resolution and found to be similar to that of the protein produced in Escherichia coli. Human IL5 was shown by analytical ultracentrifugation to form a 1:1 complex with the soluble domain of the hIL5 receptor alpha subunit (shIL5R alpha). Additionally, the relative abundance of ligand and receptor in the hIL5.shIL5R alpha complex was determined to be 1:1 by both titration calorimetry and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of dissolved cocrystals of the complex. Titration microcalorimetry yielded equilibrium dissociation constants of 3.1 and 2.0 nM, respectively, for the binding of hIL5 to shIL5R alpha and to a chimeric form of the receptor containing shIL5R alpha fused to the immunoglobulin Fc domain (shIL5R alpha-Fc). Analysis of the binding thermodynamics of IL5 and its soluble receptor indicates that conformational changes are coupled to the binding reaction. Kinetic analysis using surface plasmon resonance yielded data consistent with the Kd values from calorimetry and also with the possibility of conformational isomerization in the interaction of hIL5 with the receptor alpha subunit. Using a radioligand binding assay, the affinity of hIL5 with full-length hIL5R alpha in Drosophila membranes was found to be 6 nM, in accord with the affinities measured for the soluble receptor forms. Hence, most of the binding energy of the alpha receptor is supplied by the soluble domain. Taken with other aspects of hIL5 structure and biological activity, the data obtained allow a prediction for how 1:1 stoichiometry and conformational change can lead to the formation of hIL5.receptor alpha beta complex and signal transduction.</p>

                    <h2>Identification of regions within the third FnIII-like domain of the IL-5Ralpha involved in IL-5 interaction.</h2>
                    <h3>Cytokine; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Previously, two binding sites for interleukin 5 (IL-5) were identified on the IL-5 receptor alpha chain (IL-5Ralpha). They are located within the CD loop of the first fibronectin type III (FnIII)-like domain and the EF loop of the second FnIII-like domain. The first binding site was identified by exploiting the different abilities of human IL-5Ralpha (hIL-5Ralpha) and mouse IL-5Ralpha (mIL-5Ralpha) to bind hIL-5. Here we show that ovine IL-5 (oIL-5) has the ability to activate the hIL-5Ralpha but not the mIL-5Ralpha. By using chimeras of the mIL-5Ralpha and hIL-5Ralpha we demonstrate that residues within the first and third FnIII-like domains of mIL-5Ralpha are responsible for this lack of activity. Furthermore, mutation of residues on hIL-5Ralpha to mIL-5Ralpha within the predicted DE and FG loop regions of the third FnIII domain reduces oIL-5 activity. These results show that regions of the third FnIII domain of IL-5Ralpha are involved in binding, in addition to the regions in domains one and two of the IL-5Ralpha that were identified in an earlier study.</p>
