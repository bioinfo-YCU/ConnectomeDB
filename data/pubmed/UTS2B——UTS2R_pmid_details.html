                    <h2>Identification of urotensin II-related peptide as the urotensin II-immunoreactive molecule in the rat brain.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical and biophysical research communications; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Urotensin II (UII) has been reported as the most potent known vasoconstrictor. While rat and mouse orthologs of UII precursor protein have been reported, only the tentative structures of UII peptides of these animals have been demonstrated, since prepro-UII proteins lack typical processing sites for their mature peptides. In the present study, we isolated a novel peptide, UII-related peptide (URP), from the extract of the rat brain as the sole immunoreactive substance to anti-UII antibody; the amino acid sequence of the peptide was determined as ACFWKYCV. cDNAs encoding rat, mouse, and human precursor proteins for URP were cloned and revealed that the sequences of mouse and human URP peptides are the same as that for rat URP. Prepro-URP gene is expressed in several rat tissues such as those of the thymus, spleen, testis, and spinal cord, although with lower levels than the prepro-UII gene. In the human, the prepro-URP gene is expressed comparably to prepro-UII in several tissues except the spinal cord. URP was found to bind and activate the human or rat UII receptors (GPR14) and showed a hypotensive effect when administered to anesthetized rats. These results suggest that URP is the endogenous and functional ligand for UII receptor in the rat and mouse, and possibly in the human. We also describe the preparation of specific monoclonal antibodies raised against UII peptide and the establishment of a highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay system for UII peptides.</p>

                    <h2>Orphan-receptor ligand human urotensin II: receptor localization in human tissues and comparison of vasoconstrictor responses with endothelin-1.</h2>
                    <h3>British journal of pharmacology; 2000</h3>
                    <p>We have determined the distribution of receptors for human urotensin-II (U-II) in human and rat CNS and peripheral tissues. In rat, [(125)I]-U-II binding density was highest in the abducens nucleus of brainstem (139.6+/-14 amol mm(-2)). Moderate levels were detected in dorsal horn of spinal cord and lower levels in aorta (22. 5+/-6 amol mm(-2)). In human tissues density was highest in skeletal muscle and cerebral cortex ( approximately 30 amol mm(-2)), with lower levels (<15 amol mm(-2)) in kidney cortex and left ventricle. Little binding was identified in atria, conducting system of the heart and lung parenchyma. Receptor density was less in human coronary artery smooth muscle (14.6+/-3 amol mm(-2), n=10) than rat aorta with no significant difference between normal and atherosclerotic vessels. In human skeletal muscle [(125)I]-U-II bound to a single receptor population with K(D)=0.24+/-0.17 nM and B(max)=1.97+/-1.1 fmol mg(-1) protein (n=4). U-II contracted human coronary, mammary and radial arteries, saphenous and umbilical veins with sub-nanomolar EC(50) values. U-II was 50 times more potent in arteries and <10 times more potent in veins than endothelin-1 (ET-1). The maximum response to U-II ( approximately 20% of control KCl) was significantly less than to ET-1 ( approximately 80% KCl). In contrast, in rat aorta, U-II and ET-1 were equipotent with similar maximum responses. This is the first report of high affinity receptors for [(125)I]-U-II in human CNS and peripheral tissues. This peptide produces potent, low efficacy, vasoconstriction in human arteries and veins. These data suggest a potential role for U-II in human physiology.</p>
