                    <h2>Binding interactions of leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor with the different subunits of their high affinity receptors.</h2>
                    <h3>Journal of neurochemistry; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) share common components in their multimeric receptors. Both cytokine receptors contain gp130/interleukin-6-receptor transducer as well as gp190/low affinity LIF receptor. For CNTF, addition of a third subunit, or alpha subunit, defines the high-affinity CNTF receptor. In the present study, we analyzed the binding interactions of LIF and CNTF in human cell lines and showed a mutual displacement for LIF and CNTF toward the trimeric high-affinity CNTF receptor. Similar results were obtained in the JEG cell line, which only expressed the gp130/gp190 high-affinity LIF receptor, by adding a soluble form of the alpha CNTF receptor to the system to reconstitute the high-affinity-type CNTF receptor. The different receptor subunits were then expressed separately in transfected cells and their binding capacities analyzed. The results showed that the heterocomplex CNTF/alpha CNTF receptor bound to gp130 with an affinity of 3-5 x 10(-10)M, whereas LIF interacted mainly with gp190. In summary, the observed competition between LIF and CNTF does not result from the binding to a common site or receptor subunit, but rather to the interaction of the three receptor components to create a conformational site common to both LIF and CNTF.</p>

                    <h2>Nonradioactive receptor binding assay for ciliary neurotrophic factor.</h2>
                    <h3>Analytical biochemistry; 1994</h3>
                    <p>A nonradioactive receptor binding assay for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is described. The assay is based on the interaction between biotinylated human CNTF, soluble gp130, and soluble myc-tagged CNTF receptor captured on a microtiter plate via an antibody against the myc epitope tag. Bound cytokine is revealed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin. Purified human and rat CNTF competed with biotinylated CNTF for receptor binding, with IC50 values of 29 and 2 nM, respectively. Since the higher affinity of rat vs human CNTF has been previously shown to be conferred by the arginine residue at position 63 of the rat protein, we also tested a human CNTF mutant carrying a Q63R substitution. Secreted forms of wild-type and mutant CNTF were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the amount of cytokines in periplasmic extracts was determined by quantitative Western blotting analysis. The human CNTF mutant (Q63R, N137S) was found to compete with biotinylated CNTF for binding to soluble CNTF receptor with an eightfold higher apparent affinity than wild-type human CNTF. The present method thus faithfully reproduces the relative activities of CNTF analogs determined in other assay systems. The possibility of assaying cytokines in crude bacterial extracts makes the new technique particularly suitable for rapidly determining the receptor binding potencies of genetically engineered CNTF variants.</p>

                    <h2>The ciliary neurotrophic factor and its receptor, CNTFR alpha.</h2>
                    <h3>Pharmaceutica acta Helvetiae; 2000</h3>
                    <p>Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is expressed in glial cells within the central and peripheral nervous systems. CNTF stimulates gene expression, cell survival or differentiation in a variety of neuronal cell types such as sensory, sympathetic, ciliary and motor neurons. In addition, effects of CNTF on oligodendrocytes as well as denervated and intact skeletal muscle have been documented. CNTF itself lacks a classical signal peptide sequence of a secreted protein, but is thought to convey its cytoprotective effects after release from adult glial cells by some mechanism induced by injury. Interestingly, mice that are homozygous for an inactivated CNTF gene develop normally and initially thrive. Only later in adulthood do they exhibit a mild loss of motor neurons with resulting muscle weakness, leading to the suggestion that CNTF is not essential for neural development, but instead acts in response to injury or other stresses. The CNTF receptor complex is most closely related to, and shares subunits with the receptor complexes for interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor. The specificity conferring alpha subunit of the CNTF complex (CNTFR alpha), is extremely well conserved across species, and has a distribution localized predominantly to the nervous system and skeletal muscle. CNTFR alpha lacks a conventional transmembrane domain and is thought to be anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. Mice lacking CNTFR alpha die perinatally, perhaps indicating the existence of a second developmentally important CNTF-like ligand. Signal transduction by CNTF requires that it bind first to CNTFR alpha, permitting the recruitment of gp130 and LIFR beta, forming a tripartite receptor complex. CNTF-induced heterodimerization of the beta receptor subunits leads to tyrosine phosphorylation (through constitutively associated JAKs), and the activated receptor provides docking sites for SH2-containing signaling molecules, such as STAT proteins. Activated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to bind specific DNA sequences, resulting in enhanced transcription of responsive genes. The neuroprotective effects of CNTF have been demonstrated in a number of in vitro cell models as well as in vivo in mutant mouse strains which exhibit motor neuron degeneration. Intracerebral administration of CNTF and CNTF analogs has also been shown to protect striatal output neurons in rodent and primate models of Huntington's disease. Treatment of humans and animals with CNTF is also known to induce weight loss characterized by a preferential loss of body fat. When administered systemically, CNTF activates downstream signaling molecules such as STAT-3 in areas of the hypothalamus which regulate food intake. In addition to its neuronal actions, CNTF and analogs have been shown to act on non-neuronal cells such as glia, hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, embryonic stem cells and bone marrow stromal cells.</p>
