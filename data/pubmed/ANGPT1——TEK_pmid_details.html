                    <h2>Characterization of TEK receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligands, Angiopoietins, in human hematopoietic progenitor cells.</h2>
                    <h3>International immunology; 1998</h3>
                    <p>TEK, or TIE-2, is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is known as a functioning molecule of vascular endothelial cells. TEK comprises a subfamily of RTK with TIE, and these two receptors play critical roles in vascular maturation, maintenance of integrity and remodeling. We generated mAb against the extracellular domain of human TEK protein to elucidate its expression pattern in human hematopoietic cells. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow cells revealed that TEK was expressed in 27% of CD34+ cells, 20% of c-KIT+ cells and 26% of CD34+CD38- cells, indicating that TEK is expressed in a subset of primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). TEK was also expressed in 20% of CD19+ B lymphocytes but not in other lineage-committed cells. Progenitor assays in methylcellulose culture showed that CD34+TEK+ cells formed significantly less BFU-E and CFU-Mix than CD34+TEK- cells, but there was no difference in the number of CFU-GM between these two populations. Two recently identified TEK ligands, termed Angiopoietin-1 and -2, bound to TEK with similar affinities, and Angiopoietin-1 effectively induced TEK phosphorylation in hematopoietic cells. Angiopoietin-2 also induced a low level of TEK phosphorylation and weakened the phosphorylation induced by Angiopoietin-1, suggestive of an elaborate regulator of the TEK-TEK ligand signaling pathway. Although neither ligands affected the proliferation of TEK-transfected hematopoietic cells or the colony formation of CD34+TEK+ bone marrow cells, both promoted the adhesion of TEK-transfected hematopoietic cells to a collagen matrix or a layer of bone marrow stromal cells. These findings indicate that the TEK-TEK ligand signaling pathway is regulated in a refined manner and is involved in hematopoietic cell-microenvironment interaction.</p>

                    <h2>Angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 share the same binding domains in the Tie-2 receptor involving the first Ig-like loop and the epidermal growth factor-like repeats.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2003</h3>
                    <p>Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) have been identified as ligands with different effector functions of the vascular assembly and maturation-mediating receptor tyrosine kinase Tie-2. To understand the molecular interactions of the angiopoietins with their receptor, we have studied the binding of Ang-1 and Ang-2 to the Tie-2 receptor. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based competition assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments analyzing the binding of Ang-1 and Ang-2 to truncation mutants of the extracellular domain of Tie-2 showed that the first Ig-like loop of Tie-2 in combination with the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (amino acids 1-360) is required for angiopoietin binding. The first Ig-like domain or the EGF-like repeats alone are not capable of binding Ang-1 and Ang-2. Concomitantly, we made the surprising finding that Tie-2 exon-2 knockout mice do express a mutated Tie-2 protein that lacks 104 amino acids of the first Ig-like domain. This mutant Tie-2 receptor is functionally inactive as shown by the lack of ligand binding and receptor phosphorylation. Collectively, the data show that the first 104 amino acids of the Tie-2 receptor are essential but not sufficient for angiopoietin binding. Conversely, the first 360 amino acids (Ig-like domain plus EGF-like repeats) of the Tie-2 receptor are necessary and sufficient to bind both Ang-1 and Ang-2, which suggests that differential receptor binding is not likely to be responsible for the different functions of Ang-1 and Ang-2.</p>

                    <h2>Requisite role of angiopoietin-1, a ligand for the TIE2 receptor, during embryonic angiogenesis.</h2>
                    <h3>Cell; 1996</h3>
                    <p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which acts via members of a family of endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine kinases, is the only factor that has been shown definitively to play a role in the formation of the embryonic vasculature. Only one other family of receptor tyrosine kinases, comprising TIE1 and TIE2, is largely endothelial cell specific. We have recently cloned a ligand for TIE2, termed Angiopoietin-1. Here we show that mice engineered to lack Angiopoietin-1 display angiogenic deficits reminiscent of those previously seen in mice lacking TIE2, demonstrating that Angiopoietin-1 is a primary physiologic ligand for TIE2 and that it has critical in vivo angiogenic actions that are distinct from VEGF and that are not reflected in the classic in vitro assays used to characterize VEGF. Angiopoietin-1 seems to play a crucial role in mediating reciprocal interactions between the endothelium and surrounding matrix and mesenchyme.</p>
