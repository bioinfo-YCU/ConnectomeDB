                    <h2>Human stresscopin and stresscopin-related peptide are selective ligands for the type 2 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Nature medicine; 2001</h3>
                    <p>Adaptive stress responses mediated by the endocrine, autonomic, cardiovascular and immune systems are essential for the survival of the individual. Initial stress-induced responses provide a vital short-term metabolic lift, but prolonged or inappropriate exposure to stress can compromise homeostasis thereby leading to disease. This 'fight-or-flight' response is characterized by the activation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-adrenocorticotropin-glucocorticoid axis, mediated by the type 1 CRH receptor. In contrast, the type 2 CRH receptor mediates the stress-coping responses during the recovery phase of stress. We identified human stresscopin (SCP) and stresscopin-related peptide (SRP) as specific ligands for the type 2 CRH receptor. The genes encoding these peptides were expressed in diverse peripheral tissues as well as in the central nervous system. Treatment with SCP or SRP suppressed food intake, delayed gastric emptying and decreased heat-induced edema. Thus SCP and SRP might represent endogenous ligands for maintaining homeostasis after stress, and could allow the design of drugs to ameliorate stress-related diseases.</p>

                    <h2>Cell-type specific calcium signaling by corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 (CRF1) and 2a (CRF2(a)) receptors: phospholipase C-mediated responses in human embryonic kidney 293 but not SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells.</h2>
                    <h3>Biochemical pharmacology; 2004</h3>
                    <p>The human corticotropin-releasing factor (hCRF) receptors CRF1 and CRF2(a) couple to the Gs protein. It has been postulated that CRF receptors may also signal through phospholipase C (PLC). To test this hypothesis, binding and signaling properties were determined for both receptor subtypes stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) and human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells. CRF receptors were highly expressed and strongly coupled to Gs in HEK293 and SK-N-MC cells. However, when the calcium mobilization pathway was investigated, marked differences were observed. In SK-N-MC cells, neither CRF receptor stimulated calcium mobilization in the fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) assay, whereas activation of orexin type 1 and 2 receptors stably expressed in SK-N-MC cells revealed robust calcium responses. In contrast, intracellular calcium was strongly mobilized by agonist stimulation of hCRF1 and hCRF2(a) receptors in HEK293 cells. In HEK293 cells, potency rank orders for calcium and cAMP responses were identical for both receptors, despite a rightward shift of the dose-response curves. Complete inhibition of calcium signaling of both hCRF1 and hCRF2(a) receptors was observed in the presence of the PLC inhibitor U-73,122 whereas ryanodine, an inhibitor of calcium release channels and the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-cAMPS were ineffective. Finally, CRF agonists produced a small but significant stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) accumulation in hCRF1-and hCRF2(a)-transfected HEK293 cells. These data clearly show that phospholipase C-mediated signaling of CRF receptors is dependent upon the cellular background and that in HEK293 cells human CRF receptors robustly respond in the FLIPR format.</p>

                    <h2>Identification of urocortin III, an additional member of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family with high affinity for the CRF2 receptor.</h2>
                    <h3>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America; 2001</h3>
                    <p>The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family of neuropeptides includes the mammalian peptides CRF, urocortin, and urocortin II, as well as piscine urotensin I and frog sauvagine. The mammalian peptides signal through two G protein-coupled receptor types to modulate endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stress, as well as a range of peripheral (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and immune) activities. The three previously known ligands are differentially distributed anatomically and have distinct specificities for the two major receptor types. Here we describe the characterization of an additional CRF-related peptide, urocortin III, in the human and mouse. In searching the public human genome databases we found a partial expressed sequence tagged (EST) clone with significant sequence identity to mammalian and fish urocortin-related peptides. By using primers based on the human EST sequence, a full-length human clone was isolated from genomic DNA that encodes a protein that includes a predicted putative 38-aa peptide structurally related to other known family members. With a human probe, we then cloned the mouse ortholog from a genomic library. Human and mouse urocortin III share 90% identity in the 38-aa putative mature peptide. In the peptide coding region, both human and mouse urocortin III are 76% identical to pufferfish urocortin-related peptide and more distantly related to urocortin II, CRF, and urocortin from other mammalian species. Mouse urocortin III mRNA expression is found in areas of the brain including the hypothalamus, amygdala, and brainstem, but is not evident in the cerebellum, pituitary, or cerebral cortex; it is also expressed peripherally in small intestine and skin. Urocortin III is selective for type 2 CRF receptors and thus represents another potential endogenous ligand for these receptors.</p>
