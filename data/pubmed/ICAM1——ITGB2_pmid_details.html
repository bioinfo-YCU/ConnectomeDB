                    <h2>Interplay between rolling and firm adhesion elucidated with a cell-free system engineered with two distinct receptor-ligand pairs.</h2>
                    <h3>Biophysical journal; 2003</h3>
                    <p>The firm arrest of leukocytes to the endothelium during inflammation is known to be mediated by endothelial intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) binding to activated integrins displayed on leukocyte surface. Selectin-ligand interactions, which mediate rolling, are believed to be important for facilitating firm adhesion, either by activating integrins or by facilitating the transition to firm adhesion by making it easier for integrins to bind. Although leukocytes employ two distinct adhesion molecules that mediate different states of adhesion, the fundamental biophysical mechanisms by which two pairs of adhesion molecules facilitate cell adhesion is not well understood. In this work, we attempt to understand the interaction between two molecular systems using a cell-free system in which polystyrene microspheres functionalized with the selectin ligand, sialyl Lewis(X) (sLe(X)), and an antibody against ICAM-1, aICAM-1, are perfused over P-selectin/ICAM-1 coated surfaces in a parallel plate flow chamber. Separately, sLe(X)/P-selectin interactions support rolling and aICAM-1/ICAM-1 interactions mediate firm adhesion. Our results show that sLe(X)/aICAM-1 microspheres will firmly adhere to P-selectin/ICAM-1 coated surfaces, and that the extent of firm adhesion of microspheres is dependent on wall shear stress within the flow chamber, sLe(X)/aICAM-1 microsphere site density, and P-selectin/ICAM-1 surface density ratio. We show that P-selectin's interaction with sLe(X) mechanistically facilitates firm adhesion mediated by antibody binding to ICAM-1: the extent of firm adhesion for the same concentration of aICAM-1/ICAM-1 interaction is greater when sLe(X)/P-selectin interactions are present. aICAM-1/ICAM-1 interactions also stabilize rolling by increasing pause times and decreasing average rolling velocities. Although aICAM-1 is a surrogate for beta(2)-integrin, the kinetics of association between aICAM-1 and ICAM-1 is within a factor of 1.5 of activated integrin binding ICAM-1, suggesting the findings from this model system may be insightful to the mechanism of leukocyte firm adhesion. In particular, these experimental results show how two molecule systems can interact to produce an effect not achievable by either system alone, a fundamental mechanism that may pervade leukocyte adhesion biology.</p>

                    <h3>The Biochemical journal; 1985</h3>
                    <p>The proteins from labelled human spleen membranes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes which bind to the iC3b fragment of complement component C3 were prepared by iC3b-Sepharose chromatography in the presence of bivalent cations. Complement receptor type 3(CR3) was eluted from iC3b-Sepharose by removal of bivalent cations. Complement receptors type 1 and 2 (present in spleen but not in polymorphonuclear leucocytes) were sequentially eluted by an NaCl gradient. An additional protein of Mr 135 000 was eluted from iC3b-Sepharose under the same conditions as those used to elute CR3. Preabsorption of the starting material on an anti-(CR3 beta-subunit) antibody column before iC3b-Sepharose chromatography removed the alpha- and beta-chains of CR3 and the 135 000-Mr protein. Preabsorption with iC3b-Sepharose before the anti-(CR3 beta-subunit) antibody column showed that iC3b binds CR3 and p150,95, the smallest member of the group of three homologous proteins that share the same beta-subunit.</p>

                    <h2>A binding interface on the I domain of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) required for specific interaction with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1).</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 1995</h3>
                    <p>Previous studies have shown that lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) molecules containing the human alpha (CD11a) and human beta (CD18) subunits but not the murine alpha and human beta subunits can bind to human intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Using human/mouse LFA-1 alpha subunit chimeras, we mapped regions required for binding to ICAM-1 N-terminal to amino acid (aa) residue 350. Ligand binding sites were mapped in greater detail by scanning this region with murine sequences from 56 down to 17 aa in length and finally by introducing single or few murine aa residue replacements into the human sequence. Replacement of two non-contiguous regions of aa residues 119-153 and 218-248 in the me domain with the corresponding mouse sequences abolished most binding to human ICAM-1, without affecting alpha beta subunit association or expression on the surface of transfected COS cells. Specific residues within the I domain found to be important were Met-140, Glu-146, Thr-243, and Ser-245. Using the recently solved structure of the Mac-1 (CD11b) I domain as a model (Lee, J.-O., Rieu, P., Arnaout, M.A., and Liddington, R. (1995) Cell 80, 631-638), these residues are shown to be located on the surface of the I domain surrounding the site to which Mg2+ is chelated, and fine a ligand binding interface. Mapping of the epitopes of a panel of mouse anti-human and rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies gave concordant results. Epitopes were mapped to two different regions in the N-terminal domain, four regions within the I domain, and two regions between the I domain and the EF hand-like repeats. Monoclonal antibodies to epitopes within the mid- to C-terminal portion of the I domain and the N-terminal portion of the region between the I domain and the EF hand-like repeats gave good inhibition of LFA-1-dependent homotypic aggregation with cells that express either ICAM-1 or ICAM-3 as the major LFA-1 ligand.</p>

                    <h2>Association of the membrane proximal regions of the alpha and beta subunit cytoplasmic domains constrains an integrin in the inactive state.</h2>
                    <h3>The Journal of biological chemistry; 2001</h3>
                    <p>The adhesiveness of integrins is regulated through a process termed "inside-out" signaling. To understand the molecular mechanism of integrin inside-out signaling, we generated K562 stable cell lines that expressed LFA-1 (alpha(L)beta(2)) or Mac-1 (alpha(M)beta(2)) with mutations in the cytoplasmic domain. Complete truncation of the beta(2) cytoplasmic domain, but not a truncation that retained the membrane proximal eight residues, resulted in constitutive activation of alpha(L)beta(2) and alpha(M)beta(2), demonstrating the importance of this membrane proximal region in the regulation of integrin adhesive function. Furthermore, replacement of the alpha(L) and beta(2) cytoplasmic domains with acidic and basic peptides that form an alpha-helical coiled coil caused inactivation of alpha(L)beta(2). Association of these artificial cytoplasmic domains was directly demonstrated. By contrast, replacement of the alpha(L) and beta(2) cytoplasmic domains with two basic peptides that do not form an alpha-helical coiled coil activated alpha(L)beta(2). Induction of ligand binding by the activating cytoplasmic domain mutations correlated with the induction of activation epitopes in the extracellular domain. Our data demonstrate that cytoplasmic, membrane proximal association between integrin alpha and beta subunits, constrains an integrin in the inactive conformation.</p>
