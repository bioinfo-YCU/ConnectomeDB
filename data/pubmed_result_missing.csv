10934324,Molecular basis of semaphorin-mediated axon guidance.,"The semaphorin family of proteins constitute one of the major cues for axonal guidance. The prototypic member of this family is Sema3A, previously designated semD/III or collapsin-1. Sema3A acts as a diffusible, repulsive guidance cue in vivo for the peripheral projections of embryonic dorsal root ganglion neurons. Sema3A binds with high affinity to neuropilin-1 on growth cone filopodial tips. Although neuropilin-1 is required for Sema3A action, it is incapable of transmitting a Sema3A signal to the growth cone interior. Instead, the Sema3A/neuropilin-1 complex interacts with another transmembrane protein, plexin, on the surface of growth cones. Certain semaphorins, other than Sema3A, can bind directly to plexins. The intracellular domain of plexin is responsible for initiating the signal transduction cascade leading to growth cone collapse, axon repulsion, or growth cone turning. This intracellular cascade involves the monomeric G-protein, Rac1, and a family of neuronal proteins, the CRMPs. Rac1 is likely to be involved in semaphorin-induced rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, but how plexin controls Rac1 activity is not known. Vertebrate CRMPs are homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-33 protein, which is required for proper axon morphology in worms. CRMPs are essential for Sema3A-induced, neuropilin-plexin-mediated growth cone collapse, but the molecular interactions of growth cone CRMPs are not well defined. Mechanistic aspects of plexin-based signaling for semaphorin guidance cues may have implications for other axon guidance events and for the basis of growth cone motility.",Journal of neurobiology,2000

11099506,Identification of the protein C/activated protein C binding sites on the endothelial cell protein C receptor. Implications for a novel mode of ligand recognition by a major histocompatibility complex class 1-type receptor.,"The endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) is an endothelial cell-specific transmembrane protein that binds both protein C and activated protein C (APC). EPCR regulates the protein C anticoagulant pathway by binding protein C and augmenting protein C activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. EPCR is homologous to the MHC class 1/CD1 family, members of which contain two alpha-helices that sit upon an 8-stranded beta-sheet platform. In this study, we identified 10 residues that, when mutated to alanine, result in the loss of protein C/APC binding (Arg-81, Leu-82, Val-83, Glu-86, Arg-87, Phe-146, Tyr-154, Thr-157, Arg-158, and Glu-160). Glutamine substitutions at the four N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites of EPCR have little affect on APC binding, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties of EPCR are not critical for ligand recognition. We then mapped the epitopes for four anti-human EPCR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), two of which block EPCR/Fl-APC (APC labeled at the active site with fluorescein) interactions, whereas two do not. These epitopes were localized by generating human-mouse EPCR chimeric proteins, since the mAbs under investigation do not recognize mouse EPCR. We found that 5 of the 10 candidate residues for protein C/APC binding (Arg-81, Leu-82, Val-83, Glu-86, Arg-87) colocalize with the epitope for one of the blocking mAbs. Three-dimensional molecular modeling of EPCR indicates that the 10 protein C/APC binding candidate residues are clustered at the distal end of the two alpha-helical segments. Protein C activation studies on 293 cells that coexpress EPCR variants and thrombomodulin demonstrate that protein C binding to EPCR is necessary for the EPCR-dependent enhancement in protein activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. These studies indicate that EPCR has exploited the MHC class 1 fold for an alternative and possibly novel mode of ligand recognition. These studies are also the first to identify the protein C/APC binding region of EPCR and may provide useful information about molecular defects in EPCR that could contribute to cardiovascular disease susceptibility.",,
11511101,Il-8((3-73))K11R is a high affinity agonist of the neutrophil CXCR1 and CXCR2.,"In studies aimed at developing a high affinity IL-8 antagonist, our first objective was to generate a high-affinity IL-8 analogue. We targeted amino acids within the receptor-binding domain and found that IL-8((3-73))K11R induced significantly more neutrophil beta-glucuronidase release than either IL-8 or the alternate analogues and, in chemotaxis assays, induced 2-3-fold greater neutrophil responses than IL-8. Furthermore, in competitive radio- or biotinylated-ligand binding assays, IL-8((3-73))K11R was more effective than IL-8, IL-8((3-73)), or its T12S, H13F, and K11R/T12S/H13F analogues in blocking IL-8 binding to neutrophils; 1.8 pmol IL-8((3-73))K11R inhibited by 50% the binding of approximately 20 pmol (125)I-IL-8 to neutrophils. Both IL-8 (a CXCR1/CXCR2 ligand) and the CXCR2-specific ligand GROalpha differentially inhibited binding of (125)I-IL-8((3-73))K11R to neutrophils, albeit weakly, suggesting that IL-8((3-73))K11R is a high affinity ligand for both the CXCR1 and CXCR2. Thus IL-8((3-73))K11R is an excellent candidate for further studies aimed at generating a high affinity IL-8 antagonist.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2001.0

11785979,Ligand-dependent activation of the melanocortin 5 receptor: cAMP production and ryanodine receptor-dependent elevations of [Ca(2+)](I).,"The melanocortins are involved in the regulation of various cognitive and physiological processes such as learning, feeding, immune suppression, pigmentation, and sebum production. Five melanocortin receptors have been identified, of which the melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R) has the most widespread distribution. This subtype is found in the brain, and at numerous peripheral sites including the skin where it is expressed in the sebaceous glands. The purpose of this study was to identify the peptide that functions as a natural ligand at the MC5R in the skin. alpha-MSH, ACTH1-39, ACTH1-17, ACTH1-10, and ACTH4-10 all increased the production of cAMP in HEK293 cells transfected with the mouse MC5R. alpha-MSH and ACTH1-17 were the most potent in this respect. In addition, all peptides stimulated a rapid and transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i), and, ACTH1-10 was the most potent. The increases in [Ca(2+)](i) were of intracellular origin, but not associated with inositol phosphate production. The elevations in [Ca(2+)](i) were reduced by ruthenium red and procaine and it is therefore possible that they were mediated via ryanodine receptors.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2002.0
11856343,A novel gain-of-function mutation of the integrin alpha2 VWFA domain.,"Integrin alpha2beta1 is the major receptor for collagens in human tissues, being involved in cell adhesion and the control of collagen and collagenase gene expression. The collagen binding site of alpha2beta1 has been localized to the alpha2 von Willebrand Factor type A (VWFA) domain (A-domain or I-domain) and the residues responsible for the interaction with collagen have been mapped. We report a study of alpha2 VWFA domain in which residue E318, which lies outside the collagen binding site, is mutated to tryptophan, showing that this is a gain-of-function mutation. Recombinant alpha2-E318W VWFA domain showed elevated and specific binding to collagen I compared with the wild-type. Side chain hydrophobicity was important for the gain-of-function as elevated binding was seen with E318I and E318Y, but not with E318R. The E318W mutation had additional effects on VWFA domain properties as alpha2-E318W VWFA domain differed from the wild-type in its cation preferences for ligand binding and in binding to monoclonal antibody JA203, which bound at a site distal to E318. The gain-of-function effect was not restricted to binding to collagen I as alpha2-E318W also showed elevated binding to collagen IV, collagen I C-propeptide, laminin and E-cadherin. Binding to these ligands was inhibited by collagen peptide containing the GFOGER motif, indicating that these bound to the VWFA domain by a similar mechanism to collagen I. These data indicate that residue E318 plays a novel and important role in modulating alpha2 VWFA domain--ligand binding and may be involved in the conformational changes associated with its regulation.",European journal of biochemistry,2002
12649481,Role of EphA4 and EphrinB3 in local neuronal circuits that control walking.,Local circuits in the spinal cord that generate locomotion are termed central pattern generators (CPGs). These provide coordinated bilateral control over the normal limb alternation that underlies walking. The molecules that organize the mammalian CPG are unknown. Isolated spinal cords from mice lacking either the EphA4 receptor or its ligand ephrinB3 have lost left-right limb alternation and instead exhibit synchrony. We identified EphA4-positive neurons as an excitatory component of the locomotor CPG. Our study shows that dramatic locomotor changes can occur as a consequence of local genetic rewiring and identifies genes required for the development of normal locomotor behavior.,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2003

14716313,Saposin C is required for lipid presentation by human CD1b.,"Lipids from Mycobacterium tuberculosis are presented through CD1 proteins to T lymphocytes in humans, but the accessory molecules required for antigen loading and presentation remain unidentified. Here we show that fibroblasts deficient in sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs) transfected with CD1b failed to activate lipid-specific T cells. However, the T cell response was restored when fibroblasts were reconstituted with SAP-C but not other SAPs. Lipid antigen and SAP-C colocalized in lysosomal compartments, and liposome assays showed that SAP-C efficiently extracts antigen from membranes. Coprecipitation demonstrated direct molecular interaction between SAP-C and CD1b. We propose a model in which SAP-C exposes lipid antigens from intralysosomal membranes for loading onto CD1b. Thus, SAP-C represents a missing link in antigen presentation of lipids through CD1b to human T cells.",Nature immunology,2004.0
15001692,In vitro and in vivo evaluation of 111In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8 for cholecystokinin-B receptor imaging.,"Regulatory peptides and their analogs are being extensively investigated as radiopharmaceuticals for cancer imaging and therapy. Receptors of the cholecystokinin family have been shown to be overexpressed in different types of neuroendocrine tumors. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the cholecystokinin octapeptide amide (CCK8) peptide tagged with a diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid derivative (DTPAGlu) and to test whether a (111)In-labeled conjugate ((111)In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8, a derivative containing the chelating agent DTPAGlu bound through a glycine linker at the N-terminal end of the bioactive peptide CCK8) is suitable for cholecystokinin-B receptor (CCKBR) imaging.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",2004
15851487,Identification of proteoglycans as the APRIL-specific binding partners.,"B cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) are closely related ligands within the TNF superfamily that play important roles in B lymphocyte biology. Both ligands share two receptors--transmembrane activator and calcium signal--modulating cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)--that are predominantly expressed on B cells. In addition, BAFF specifically binds BAFF receptor, whereas the nature of a postulated APRIL-specific receptor remains elusive. We show that the TNF homology domain of APRIL binds BCMA and TACI, whereas a basic amino acid sequence (QKQKKQ) close to the NH2 terminus of the mature protein is required for binding to the APRIL-specific ""receptor."" This interactor was identified as negatively charged sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Although T cell lines bound little APRIL, the ectopic expression of glycosaminoglycan-rich syndecans or glypicans conferred on these cells a high binding capacity that was completely dependent on APRIL's basic sequence. Moreover, syndecan-1-positive plasma cells and proteoglycan-rich nonhematopoietic cells displayed high specific, heparin-sensitive binding to APRIL. Inhibition of BAFF and APRIL, but not BAFF alone, prevented the survival and/or the migration of newly formed plasma cells to the bone marrow. In addition, costimulation of B cell proliferation by APRIL was only effective upon APRIL oligomerization. Therefore, we propose a model whereby APRIL binding to the extracellular matrix or to proteoglycan-positive cells induces APRIL oligomerization, which is the prerequisite for the triggering of TACI- and/or BCMA-mediated activation, migration, or survival signals.",,
16411781,Relaxin-3: improved synthesis strategy and demonstration of its high-affinity interaction with the relaxin receptor LGR7 both in vitro and in vivo.,"Relaxin-3 is a member of the human relaxin peptide family, the gene for which, RLN3, is predominantly expressed in the brain. Mapping studies in the rodent indicate a highly developed network of RLN3, RLN1, and relaxin receptor-expressing cells in the brain, suggesting that relaxin peptides have important functional roles in the central nervous system. A regioselective disulfide-bond synthesis protocol was developed and used for the chemical synthesis of human (H3) relaxin-3. The selectively S-protected A and B chains were combined by stepwise formation of each of the three insulin-like disulfides via aeration, thioloysis, and iodolysis. Judicious positioning of the three sets of S-protecting groups was crucial for acquisition of synthetic H3 relaxin in a good overall yield. The activity of the peptide was tested against relaxin family peptide receptors. Although the highest activity was demonstrated on the human relaxin-3 receptor (GPCR135), the peptide also showed high activity on relaxin receptors (LGR7) from various species and variable activity on the INSL3 receptor (LGR8). Recombinant mouse prorelaxin-3 demonstrated similar activity to H3 relaxin, suggesting that the presence of the C peptide did not influence the conformation of the active site. H3 relaxin was also able to activate native LGR7 receptors. It stimulated increased MMP-2 expression in LGR7-expressing rat ventricular fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner and, following infusion into the lateral ventricle of the brain, stimulated water drinking in rats, activating LGR7 receptors located in the subfornical organ. Thus, H3 relaxin is able to interact with the relaxin receptor LGR7 both in vitro and in vivo.",Biochemistry,2006.0
1967312,Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of dynorphin A-(1-8) amide analogues.,"In order to study the structure-activity relationships of dynorphin A-(1-8) amide [Dyn(1-8)-NH2], 20 analogues were synthesized by the solution method. Their biological activities were determined in the three bioassays [guinea pig ileum (GPI), mouse vas deferens (MVD), and rabbit vas deferens (RVD)] and in the mouse tail-pinch test after intravenous administration. Some analogues that showed interesting activity in the bioassays and/or in the analgesic tests were further characterized in mu-, delta-, and kappa-representative binding assays. The obtained data indicate that modification of the enkephalin segment to give metabolically stable analogues with high affinity and selectivity for the kappa receptor is strictly limited and that introduction of MeArg in position 7 protects the Arg6-Arg-7 bond from enzymatic degradation without potency drop and change of opioid receptor selectivity. [MeTyr1,MeArg7,D-Leu8]Dyn(1-8)-NHEt (18) [IC50 (nM) = 0.3 (GPI), 7.4 (MVD), and 2.6 (RVD); tail pinch ED50 (mg/kg) = 0.75] showed opioid activity similar to that of dynorphin A in the three bioassays and relatively high kappa-receptor selectivity in the binding assays and produced a 2.5-fold more potent analgesic effect than morphine. [D-Cys2-Cys5,MeArg7,D-Leu8]Dyn(1-8)-NHEt (20) showed a 40-60-fold more potent opioid activity than 18 in the three bioassays and produced a 3.4-fold more potent analgesic effect than 18. In the binding assays, however, 20 showed higher affinity for mu and delta receptors than for the kappa receptor.",Journal of medicinal chemistry,1990
2466334,Structure and function of human amphiregulin: a member of the epidermal growth factor family.,"The complete amino acid sequence of amphiregulin, a bifunctional cell growth modulator, was determined. The truncated form contains 78 amino acids, whereas a larger form of amphiregulin contains six additional amino acids at the amino-terminal end. The amino-terminal half of amphiregulin is extremely hydrophilic and contains unusually high numbers of lysine, arginine, and asparagine residues. The carboxyl-terminal half of amphiregulin (residues 46 to 84) exhibits striking homology to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of proteins. Amphiregulin binds to the EGF receptor but not as well as EGF does. Amphiregulin fully supplants the requirement for EGF or transforming growth factor-alpha in murine keratinocyte growth, but it is a much weaker growth stimulator in other cell systems.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1989
25109685,FAM19A4 is a novel cytokine ligand of formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) and is able to promote the migration and phagocytosis of macrophages.,"FAM19A4 is an abbreviation for family with sequence similarity 19 (chemokine (C-C motif)-like) member A4, which is a secretory protein expressed in low levels in normal tissues. The biological functions of FAM19A4 remain to be determined, and its potential receptor(s) is unclarified. In this study, we demonstrated that FAM19A4 was a classical secretory protein and we verified for the first time that its mature protein is composed of 95 amino acids. We found that the expression of this novel cytokine was upregulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes and macrophages and was typically in polarized M1. FAM19A4 shows chemotactic activities on macrophages and enhances the macrophage phagocytosis of zymosan both in vitro and in vivo with noticeable increases of the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). FAM19A4 can also increase the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon zymosan stimulation. Furthermore, based on receptor internalization, radio ligand binding assays and receptor blockage, we demonstrated for the first time that FAM19A4 is a novel ligand of formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1). The above data indicate that upon inflammatory stimulation, monocyte/macrophage-derived FAM19A4 may play a crucial role in the migration and activation of macrophages during pathogenic infections.",Cellular & molecular immunology,2015
2558309,Identification of a cDNA encoding a long form of prolactin receptor in human hepatoma and breast cancer cells.,"Human PRL receptor cDNA clones from hepatoma (Hep G2) and breast cancer (T-47D) libraries were isolated by using a rat PRL receptor cDNA probe. The nucleotide sequence predicts a mature protein of 598 amino acids with a much longer cytoplasmic domain than the rat liver PRL receptor. Although this extended region has additional segments of localized sequence identity with the human GH receptor, there is no identity with any consensus sequences known to be involved in hormonal signal transduction. This cDNA will be a valuable tool to better understand the role of PRL in the development and growth of human breast cancer.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",1989
9125122,Identification and characterization of a novel human cortistatin-like peptide.,"Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that showed significant homology to rat cortistatin (CST) were found in a human fetal brain cDNA library. A protein coded by the cDNA showed 55% identity to rat preprocortistatin in amino acid. Similarly in the generation of mature peptides from rat preprocortistatin, it was expected that cleavage at dibasic amino acids in the C-terminal portion of the coded protein might produce at least two different sizes of mature peptides with 29 and 17 amino acid residues, respectively. We chemically synthesized the predicted mature peptide with 17 amino acid residues (hCS-17) and examined its biological activities. It bound to all human somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtypes in almost the same manner as rat CST-14. It also inhibited cAMP production induced by forskolin through SSTRs. Administration of hCS-17 to the cerebral ventricle showed flattening of cortical and hippocampal electroencephalograms in rats. These results indicate that a bioactive peptide encoded by the cDNA is a human counterpart corresponding to rat CST.",,
9832610,"A new low density lipoprotein receptor related protein, LRP5, is expressed in hepatocytes and adrenal cortex, and recognizes apolipoprotein E.","The isolation and characterization of rabbit and human cDNAs revealed a new low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related protein (LRP) designated as LRP5. Human LRP5 cDNA encodes a 1, 616-amino acid type I membrane-like protein with three ligand binding repeats in its extracellular region. LDLR-deficient cells transduced by recombinant adenovirus containing human LRP5 exhibited increased binding of apolipoprotein E (apoE)-enriched beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization revealed a high level of LRP5 expression in hepatocytes and the adrenal gland cortex. In LDLR-deficient Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, LRP5 mRNA was increased in the liver and accumulated in cholesterol-laden foam cells of atherosclerotic lesions.",,
