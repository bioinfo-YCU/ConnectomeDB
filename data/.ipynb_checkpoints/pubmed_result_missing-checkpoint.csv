11931347,"(N-stearyl, norleucine17)VIPhybrid is a broad spectrum vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor antagonist.","The effects of a (N-stearyl, Norleucine17) vasoactive intestinal peptide hybrid ((SN)VIPhybrid) on cells stably transfected with VPAC,, VPAC2, or PAC1 receptors were investigated. (SN)VIPhybrid inhibited specific 125I-VIP binding to membranes derived from CHO cells transfected with VPAC, or VPAC2 receptors with high affinity (IC50 = 30 and 50 nM). (SN)VIPhyb inhibited specific 125I-PACAP-27 binding to membranes derived from NIH/3T3 cells transfected with PAC1 receptors with high affinity (IC50 = 65 nM). PACAP-27 caused cAMP elevation in NIH/3T3 cells transfected with PAC1 receptors and the increase cAMP caused by pituitary adenylated cyclase (PACAP) was inhibited by (SN)VIPhyb. Also, the increase in cAMP caused by VIP using CHO cells transfected with VPAC1 or VPAC2 receptors was antagonized by (SN)VIPhyb. These results indicate that (SN)VIPhyb is an antagonist for VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1 receptors.",,
12446593,[1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] arginine vasopressin: a potent and specific agonist for vasopressin V1b receptors.,"To date, there are no vasopressin (VP) agonists that exhibit a high affinity and selectivity for the VP V1b receptor with respect to the V1a, V2, and oxytocin receptors. In this study, we describe the synthesis and pharmacological properties of [1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] arginine vasopressin (d[Cha4]AVP). Binding experiments performed on various membrane preparations revealed that d[Cha(4)]AVP exhibits a nanomolar affinity for V1b receptors from various mammalian species (rat, bovine, human). It exhibits high V1b/V1a and V1b/oxytocin selectivity for rat, human, and bovine receptors. Furthermore, it exhibits high V1b/V2 specificity for both bovine and human vasopressin receptors. Functional studies performed on biological models that naturally express V1b receptors indicate that d[Cha4]AVP is an agonist. Like VP, it stimulated basal and corticotropin-releasing factor-stimulated ACTH secretion and basal catecholamine release from rat anterior pituitary and bovine chromaffin cells, respectively. In vivo experiments performed in rat revealed that d[Cha4]AVP was able to stimulate both ACTH and corticosterone secretion and exhibits negligible vasopressor activity. It retains about 30% of the antidiuretic activity of VP. This long-sought selective VP V1b receptor ligand with nanomolar affinity will allow a better understanding of V1b-mediated VP physiological effects and is a promising new tool for V1b receptor structure-function studies.",,
11375253,[125I]-S36057: a new and highly potent radioligand for the melanin-concentrating hormone receptor.,"Shortened, more stable and weakly hydrophobic analogues of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) were searched as candidates for radioiodination. Starting from the dodecapeptide MCH(6 - 17), we found that: (1) substitution of Tyr(13) by a Phe residue; (2) addition of a 3-iodo-Tyr residue at the N-terminus; and (3) addition of a hydrophilic spacer 8-amino-3,6-dioxyoctanoyl between the 3-iodo-Tyr and MCH(6 - 17) (compound S36057), led to an agonist more potent than MCH itself in stimulating [35S]-GTPgammaS binding at membranes from HEK293 cells stably expressing the human MCH receptor. Specific binding of [125I]-S36057 was found in HEK293 and CHO cell lines stably expressing the human MCH receptor. This radioligand recognized a similar number of binding sites (ca. 800 fmol mg(-1)) than [125I]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH. However, the K(D) for [125I]-S36057 obtained from saturation studies (0.037 nM) or from binding kinetics (0.046 nM) was at least 10 fold higher to that of [125I]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH (0.46 nM). Affinities determined for a series of MCH analogues were similar with both radioligands, S36057 being the most potent compound tested (K(i)=0.053 nM). Finally, [125I]-S36057 also potently labelled the MCH receptor in membranes from whole rat brain (K(D) 0.044 nM, B(max)=11 fmol mg(-1)). In conclusion, [125I]-S36057 is a more potent and more stable radioligand than [125I]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH that will represent a reliable tool for binding assays in the search of novel MCH ligands. It should also provide great help for autoradiographic studies of the MCH receptor distribution in the central nervous system.",British journal of pharmacology,2001
9652348,[125I][Tyr3]octreotide labels human somatostatin sst2 and sst5 receptors.,"Human somatostatin (somatotropin release inhibiting factor = SRIF) receptor subtypes sst2 and sst5 were stably expressed in Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (CCL39) cells. [125I][Tyr3]octreotide labelled with high affinity and in a saturable manner both sst2 (pKd = 9.89+/-0.02, Bmax = 210+/-10 fmol/mg, n = 3) and sst5 sites (pKd = 9.64+/-0.04, Bmax = 920+/-170 fmol/mg, n = 3). The pharmacological profile of sst2 sites established in CCL39 cells using SRIF and various peptide analogues was very similar to that described previously in CHO cells and in human cortex: SRIF14 = SRIF28 > or = seglitide > BIM 23014 = RC 160 > octreotide > CGP 23996 > or = L362,855 > BIM 23052 > L361,301 = cortistatin14 > BIM 23030 > BIM 23056 > cycloantagonist SA. However, peptides classically perceived as sst2 receptor selective (e.g., seglitide, octreotide, vapreotide) showed also high affinity for human sst5 receptors labelled with [125I][Tyr3]octreotide: SRIF28 > seglitide > SRIF14 > L361,301 = octreotide > cortistatin14 = BIM 23014 = BIM 23052 > L362,855 = RC160 > CGP 23996 > BIM 23056 > cycloantagonist SA > BIM 23030. Further radioligand binding studies were performed with [Leu8,D-Trp22,125I-Tyr25]SRIF28 ([125I]LTT-SRIF28) and [125I]CGP 23996. At sst2 receptors, Bmax values determined with [125I][Tyr3]octreotide, [125I]LTT-SRIF28 and [125I]CGP 23996 were in the same range (180-370 fmol/mg). 5'-Guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) displaced all three radioligands to the same extent (85%) and the pharmacological profiles were superimposable. By contrast, at sst5 receptors Bmax values were very different: [125I][Tyr3]octreotide (920 fmol/mg), [125I]CGP 23996 (3530 fmol/mg) and [125I]LTT-SRIF28 (6950 fmol/mg). GppNHp affected [125I][Tyr3]octreotide more than [125I]CGP 23996 binding, whereas [125I]LTT-SRIF28 was much less affected. In addition, the affinity values determined in competition experiments at sst5 receptors, varied markedly; whereas SRIF14, cortistatin14 and SRIF28 showed 2-, 4- and 8-fold differences in affinity at sst5 receptors labelled with [125I][Tyr3]octreotide and [125I]LTT-SRIF28 compounds such as RC160, L363,301, L362,855, octreotide or CGP 23996 showed between 42- and 123-fold lower affinity when sst5 sites were labelled with [125I]LTT-SRIF28. The present data suggest caution to be used when comparing affinity profiles determined in binding studies using different radioligands. In addition, the present results suggest that effects produced by octreotide and related short chain SRIF analogues on hormone release, modulation of tumour growth and central effects may be mediated by either sst2 and/or sst5 receptors.",,
9650799,[125I]Tyr10-cortistatin14 labels all five somatostatin receptors.,"The recently cloned rat preprocortistatin, which shows homology to the preprosomatostatin peptide, is thought to be enzymatically cleaved to cortistatin14 (CST14) similarly to somatostatin14 (SRIF14). High structural similarity of cortistatin14 compared to SRIF14 suggested binding properties to somatostatin receptors similar to SRIF14. In the present study, we expressed stably the five human somatostatin receptor subtypes (hsst1-hsst5) in CCL39 cells (Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells). The receptors were labelled with an iodinated analogue of CST14 ([125I]Tyr10)-cortistatin14, [125I]Tyr10-CST) to establish the pharmacological profile of hsst1-hsst5 sites labelled with [125I]Tyr10-CST. In parallel, [Leu8,D-Trp22,125I-Tyr25]-SRIF28 ([125I]LTT-SRIF28) was used as a control at the five recombinant SRIF receptors stably expressed in CCL39 cells. High affinity [125I]Tyr10-CST binding could be demonstrated to all five recombinant somatostatin receptor subtypes. The pKd (-log mol/l) and Bmax values (fmol/mg) for hsst1-5 receptors were: 10.02+/-0.04, 220+/-30; 9.45+/-0.09, 340+/-70; 10.06+/-0.11, 340+/-50; 9.67+/-0.14, 340+/-110 and 10.33+/-0.03, 5630+/-1330, respectively. The pharmacological profiles determined with [125I]Tyr10-CST and [125I]LTT-SRIF28 were very similar at every receptor studied. These data suggest that cortistatin and somatostatin have similar high affinity for SRIF receptors. None of the receptors showed marked selectivity for either CST14/CST17 or the somatostatins. In conclusion, the data show that cortistatin and somatostatin have very similar high affinity to all five recombinant somatostatin receptors. It remains to be seen whether there are specific receptors which bind only somatostatins or cortistatins.",Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,1998

Recent studies in monkeys demonstrated that i.t. co-application of N/OFQ and morphine elicits synergistic antinociceptive actions suggesting mixed N/OFQ peptide (NOP) and μ opioid receptor agonists as innovative spinal analgesics. Thus, novel N/OFQ related peptides were synthesized in order to identify and pharmacologically characterize a mixed NOP/ μ opioid receptor agonist.",,
7377534,[Duration of preoxygenation in patients with normal and impaired lung function (author's transl)].,"We determined the time required for the O2-filling of the lung, which is important for reasons of preoxygenation prior to intubation during apnoea and apnoeic oxygenation. 97 patients were examined. A multiple breath nitrogen washout method, the Hewlett-Packard lung function analyser HP 47402 A, was used. Complete O2-saturation of the lung in three different groups of patients took a mean time of 2 min 55 s, 4 min 20 s and 7 min 17 s. The differences were attributed to varying qualities of ventilatory gas distribution. Total O2-filling of the lung is necessary for apnoeic oxygenation. After breathing air, there is a mean decrease of PaO2 from 97 to 54 mm of mercury in 2 min of apnoea. For purposes of intubation, a 90% O2-filling of the lung takes not more than 1 and a half minutes even in patients with seriously impaired lung function. The gain of apnoeic tolerance time is approximately 4 min.",Der Anaesthesist,1980

11857925,[Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus associated with mutations of vasopressin V2 receptors and aquaporin-2].,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus has two types of X-linked and autosomal recessive inheritance. The former is the mutations of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V2 receptors that have had 155 mutations in 239 families in the literature. The latter is the mutations of aquaporin-2(AQP-2) water channel, which have had 11 mutations. The functional analysis of V2 receptor mutations has resulted in two abnormalities. The mutated receptors retain in cytoplasma and can not fold into plasma membrane in most of AVP V2 receptor mutations. The other is that the mutated receptors, localized in plasma membrane, can not either bind to its ligand AVP or transduce its signal to the post-receptor pathway. Also, the mutated AQP-2 is functionally divided into two types of abnormality. In 10 out of 11 mutations, the mutated AQP-2 is located in endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, and can not be translocated into apical plasma membrane. The mutated AQP-2 should functionally produce water permeability, if it could be routed into plasma membrane. Only one mutation of AQP-2 (T125M and G175R) can be folded in apical membrane, but it does not produce water permeability. Recently, the experimental trials have been begun for rescuing the mutated AVP V2 receptors or AQP-2.",,

9264324,1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) as an agonist on V1b vasopressin receptor.,"1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) is considered a standard vasopressin V2 receptor-selective agonist with a potent antidiuretic effect through V2 receptor without the induction of vasoconstriction through V1a receptor. Furthermore, DDAVP was reported to act as an agonist on non-V1a, non-V2 receptor to cause the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ in several tissues. However, the agonistic activity of DDAVP against the other vasopressin receptor, V1b (or V3), which can accumulate intracellular Ca2+ and which we recently cloned, has not been clarified. Hence, we compared the characteristics of DDAVP on V1b receptor with those on the other vasopressin receptors. In binding experiments, DDAVP more strongly inhibited [3H]arginine vasopressin binding to V1b than to V2 receptor (Ki: 5.84 nM vs 65.9 nM). In addition, DDAVP dose-dependently stimulated inositol turnover in human V1b receptor-expressing COS-1 cells. DDAVP acted as a full agonist on human V1b receptor (EC50: 11.4 nM) as well as on human V2 receptor (EC50: 23.9 nM). However, DDAVP behaved as a partial agonist toward rat V1b receptor (intrinsic activity: 0.7, EC50: 43.5 nM), while there was no significant difference in the agonistic properties of arginine vasopressin on human and rat V1b receptor. In conclusion, DDAVP acts as an agonist on V1b receptor, as it does on V2 receptor. These findings will allow us to better understand the physiological role of V1b receptor in pancreatic beta cells and in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, and help us to identify as yet unknown vasopressin receptors through which DDAVP cause the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ in other tissues.",,
15870174,2B4 (CD244)-CD48 interactions provide a novel MHC class I-independent system for NK-cell self-tolerance in mice.,"Natural killer (NK) cells must be able to eliminate infected and transformed cells while remaining tolerant of normal cells. NK-cell self-tolerance is thought to be maintained by self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I recognition; however, there are examples where NK cells are not regulated by MHC class I and yet remain self-tolerant. Here, we show that 2B4 (CD244) and CD48 represent a second system for murine NK-cell self-recognition. 2B4 and MHC class I receptors act nonredundantly to inhibit NK lysis of syngeneic tumor cells. NK cells from beta2 microglobulin (beta2m)-deficient mice and NK cells that lack expression of self-MHC-binding inhibitory receptors are inhibited by 2B4. Moreover, we provide the first in vivo evidence for MHC-independent NK self-recognition in a bone marrow rejection assay. These data suggest that NK-cell self-tolerance can be mediated by molecules other than MHC.",Blood,2005
1718973,39-kDa protein modulates binding of ligands to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor.,A 39-kDa protein of unknown function has previously been reported to copurify with the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor. In this study we demonstrate that a recombinant 39-kDa fusion protein can reversibly bind to the 515-kDa subunit of the LRP/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor. This interaction inhibits the binding and uptake of the receptor's two known ligands: 1) beta-migrating very low density lipoproteins activated by enrichment with apoprotein E and 2) alpha 2-macroglobulin activated by incubation with plasma proteases or methylamine. A potential in vivo role of the 39-kDa protein is to modulate the uptake of apoE-enriched lipoproteins and activated alpha 2-macroglobulin in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues.,,
9585422,"6-C-kine (SLC), a lymphocyte adhesion-triggering chemokine expressed by high endothelium, is an agonist for the MIP-3beta receptor CCR7.","The beta chemokine known as 6-C-kine, secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine (SLC), TCA4, or Exodus-2 (herein referred to as 6CK/SLC) can trigger rapid integrin-dependent arrest of lymphocytes rolling under physiological shear and is highly expressed by high endothelial venules, specialized vessels involved in lymphocyte homing from the blood into lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. We show that 6CK/SLC is an agonist for the lymphocyte chemoattractant receptor, CCR7 (EBI-1, BLR-2), previously described as a receptor for the related beta chemokine MIP-3beta (ELC or Exodus-3). Moreover, 6CK/SLC and MIP-3beta attract the same major populations of circulating lymphocytes, including naive and memory T cells > B cells (but not natural killer cells); desensitization to MIP-3beta inhibits lymphocyte chemotaxis to 6CK/SLC but not to the alpha chemokine SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor); and 6CK/SLC competes for MIP-3beta binding to resting mouse lymphocytes. The findings suggest that the majority of circulating lymphocytes respond to 6CK/SLC and MIP-3beta in large part through their common receptor CCR7 and that these molecules may be important mediators of physiological lymphocyte recirculation in vivo.",,
11751331,A 3D structure model of integrin alpha 4 beta 1 complex: I. Construction of a homology model of beta 1 and ligand binding analysis.,"It is well established that integrin alpha 4 beta 1 binds to the vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and fibronectin and plays an important role in signal transduction. Blocking the binding of VCAM to alpha 4 beta 1 is thought to be a way of controlling a number of disease processes. To better understand how various inhibitors might block the interaction of VCAM and fibronectin with alpha 4 beta 1, we began constructing a structure model for the integrin alpha 4 beta 1 complex. As the first step, we have built a homology model of the beta 1 subunit based on the I domain of the integrin CD11B subunit. The model, including a bound Mg(2+) ion, was optimized through a specially designed relaxation scheme involving restrained minimization and dynamics steps. The native ligand VCAM and two highly active small molecules (TBC772 and TBC3486) shown to inhibit binding of CS-1 and VCAM to alpha 4 beta 1 were docked into the active site of the refined model. Results from the binding analysis fit well with a pharmacophore model that was independently derived from active analog studies. A critical examination of residues in the binding site and analysis of docked ligands that are both potent and selective led to the proposal of a mechanism for beta 1/beta 7 ligand binding selectivity.",Biophysical journal,2002
9486651,A B-cell-homing chemokine made in lymphoid follicles activates Burkitt's lymphoma receptor-1.,"Secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer's patches) are divided into compartments, such as B-cell zones (follicles) and T-cell zones, which provide specialized environments for specific steps of the immune response. Migration of lymphocyte subsets into these compartments is essential for normal immune function, yet the molecular cues guiding this cellular traffic are poorly defined. Chemokines constitute a family of chemotactic cytokines that have been shown to direct the migration of leukocytes during inflammation and which may be involved in the constitutive homing of lymphocytes into follicles and T-cell zones. Here we describe a novel chemokine, B-lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC), that is strongly expressed in the follicles of Peyer's patches, the spleen and lymph nodes. BLC strongly attracts B lymphocytes while promoting migration of only small numbers of T cells and macrophages, and therefore is the first chemokine to be identified that is selective towards B cells. An orphan chemokine receptor, Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (BLR-1), has been found to be required for B-cell migration into lymphoid follicles. We show that BLC stimulates calcium influx into, and chemotaxis of, cells transfected with BLR-1. Our results indicate that BLC functions as a BLR-1 ligand and may guide B lymphocytes to follicles in secondary lymphoid organs.",,
7642561,A binding interface on the I domain of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) required for specific interaction with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1).,"Previous studies have shown that lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) molecules containing the human alpha (CD11a) and human beta (CD18) subunits but not the murine alpha and human beta subunits can bind to human intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Using human/mouse LFA-1 alpha subunit chimeras, we mapped regions required for binding to ICAM-1 N-terminal to amino acid (aa) residue 350. Ligand binding sites were mapped in greater detail by scanning this region with murine sequences from 56 down to 17 aa in length and finally by introducing single or few murine aa residue replacements into the human sequence. Replacement of two non-contiguous regions of aa residues 119-153 and 218-248 in the me domain with the corresponding mouse sequences abolished most binding to human ICAM-1, without affecting alpha beta subunit association or expression on the surface of transfected COS cells. Specific residues within the I domain found to be important were Met-140, Glu-146, Thr-243, and Ser-245. Using the recently solved structure of the Mac-1 (CD11b) I domain as a model (Lee, J.-O., Rieu, P., Arnaout, M.A., and Liddington, R. (1995) Cell 80, 631-638), these residues are shown to be located on the surface of the I domain surrounding the site to which Mg2+ is chelated, and fine a ligand binding interface. Mapping of the epitopes of a panel of mouse anti-human and rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies gave concordant results. Epitopes were mapped to two different regions in the N-terminal domain, four regions within the I domain, and two regions between the I domain and the EF hand-like repeats. Monoclonal antibodies to epitopes within the mid- to C-terminal portion of the I domain and the N-terminal portion of the region between the I domain and the EF hand-like repeats gave good inhibition of LFA-1-dependent homotypic aggregation with cells that express either ICAM-1 or ICAM-3 as the major LFA-1 ligand.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1995
7592829,A biochemical characterization of the binding of osteopontin to integrins alpha v beta 1 and alpha v beta 5.,"Osteopontin (OPN) is an extracellular matrix protein that binds to integrin alpha v beta 3. Here we demonstrate that two other integrins, alpha v beta 1 and alpha v beta 5, are also receptors for OPN. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells adhere to human recombinant osteopontin (glutathione S-transferase-osteopontin; GST-OPN) using integrin alpha v beta 1. When the 293 cells are transfected with the beta 5 subunit, they can also adhere to GST-OPN using integrin alpha v beta 5. Divalent cations regulate the binding of GST-OPN to both alpha v beta 1 and alpha v beta 5. Mg2+ and Mn2+ support the binding of GST-OPN to these integrins but Ca2+ does not. The highest affinity is observed in Mn2+. In the presence of this ion, the affinity of GST-OPN for alpha v beta 1 is 18 nM and the affinity for alpha v beta 5 is 48 nM. The antibody 8A2, which is an agonist for beta 1, promotes the adhesion of 293 cells to GST-OPN even when Ca2+ is present. This observation suggests that cellular events could modulate the affinity of alpha v beta 1 for OPN. Collectively, these findings prove that integrins alpha v beta 1, alpha v beta 3, and alpha v beta 5 have similar affinity for OPN. Therefore, all three integrins must be considered when evaluating the biological affects of OPN.",,
11137996,A biochemical function for attractin in agouti-induced pigmentation and obesity.,"Agouti protein, a paracrine signaling molecule normally limited to skin, is ectopically expressed in lethal yellow (A(y)) mice, and causes obesity by mimicking agouti-related protein (Agrp), found primarily in the hypothalamus. Mouse attractin (Atrn) is a widely expressed transmembrane protein whose loss of function in mahogany (Atrn(mg-3J)/ Atrn(mg-3J)) mutant mice blocks the pleiotropic effects of A(y). Here we demonstrate in transgenic, biochemical and genetic-interaction experiments that attractin is a low-affinity receptor for agouti protein, but not Agrp, in vitro and in vivo. Additional histopathologic abnormalities in Atrn(mg-3J)/Atrn(mg-3J) mice and cross-species genomic comparisons indicate that Atrn has multiple functions distinct from both a physiologic and an evolutionary perspective.",,
12482954,A CADASIL-mutated Notch 3 receptor exhibits impaired intracellular trafficking and maturation but normal ligand-induced signaling.,"Notch receptors are single transmembrane receptors that contain a large number of epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGF repeats) in their extracellular domains. Mutations in the EGF repeats of the human Notch 3 receptor lead to the vascular dementia disease Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). The vast majority of CADASIL mutations are missense mutations removing or inserting cysteine residues in the EGF repeats, but it is not yet clear whether these mutations primarily affect receptor trafficking, maturation, andor signaling. To address this issue, we have generated and analyzed stable cell lines expressing either wild-type murine Notch 3 (mNotch 3) or the mutant mNotch 3(R142C), which corresponds to the prevalent CADASIL form of Notch 3, Notch 3(R141C) in humans. We find that a lower proportion of mNotch 3(R142C) is expressed in the site 1-cleaved configuration, and that reduced amounts of mNotch 3(R142C) appear at the cell surface, as compared with wild-type mNotch 3. This observation is accompanied by a higher propensity for mNotch 3(R142C) to form intracellular aggregates, which may be a result of increased accumulation or slowed transport in the secretory pathway. In contrast to the impaired cell surface expression, mNotch 3(R142C) signals equally well in response to Delta 1 and Jagged 1 as wild-type mNotch 3. Taken together, these data suggest that trafficking and localization rather than signaling of mNotch 3 are affected in mNotch 3(R142C).",,
7989348,A carboxyl-terminal fragment of lipoprotein lipase binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and inhibits lipase-mediated uptake of lipoprotein in cells.,"It has previously been shown that lipoprotein lipase can mediate uptake of remnant lipoprotein particles via binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP). Binding of lipoprotein lipase, and of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins associated with the lipase, to LRP depends on an intact carboxyl-terminal folding domain of the lipase (Nykjaer, A., Bengtsson-Olivecrona, G., Lookene, A., Moestrup, S. K., Petersen, C. M., Weber, W., Beisiegel, W., and Gliemann, J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 15048-15055). Here we show that the site for binding to the receptor is within residues 380-425 of the bovine and residues 378-423 of the human lipoprotein lipase. We demonstrate that a carboxyl-terminal fragment of human lipoprotein lipase (residues 378-448), expressed as fusion protein in Escherichia coli, binds to purified and cellular LRP but not to lipoproteins. Binding of the fragment to purified LRP was blocked by heparin. In addition, the fragment inhibited the binding of lipase and the lipase-mediated binding of lipoproteins to the purified receptor. The fragment exhibited reduced binding to proteoglycan-deficient cells. Moreover, the fragment inhibited the uptake of lipoproteins in cells mediated by the lipase via binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans and LRP. We conclude that the fragment contains the site for binding to LRP and a candidate site for interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, whereas binding to lipoproteins is inefficient. The fragment can therefore inhibit the lipase-mediated lipoprotein uptake, a process that may promote the development of atherosclerosis when occurring in cells of the arterial wall.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1994
10772961,A CD36-binding peptide from thrombospondin-1 can stimulate resorption by osteoclasts in vitro.,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), purified from platelets, stimulates resorption by avian osteoclasts in an in vitro resorption assay. TSP-1 binds to a number of different cellular receptors via different domains of the molecule and several short receptor-binding sequences have been identified within the TSP-1 molecule. In this study, we have used synthetic peptides representing these various sequences in order to identify the cellular receptor and TSP domain responsible for stimulation of resorption. We show that one peptide CSVTCG, which represents the CD36-binding region of TSP-1, stimulates resorption in a fashion similar to the intact molecule, while the peptides RGDS, RFYVVMWK, and RFYVVM, representing other cell-binding domains of TSP, have no effect on resorption. Using RT-PCR and immunoblotting, we further demonstrate expression of CD36 in human osteoclastoma (giant cell tumour), primary human bone derived cells, and clonal osteoblastic cells. These studies suggest that CD36 is involved in regulation of resorption by osteoclasts and is the receptor responsible for the resorption-promoting effects of TSP-1.",,
8626685,A cDNA encoding the calcitonin gene-related peptide type 1 receptor.,"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide with diverse biological effects including potent vasodilator activity. We report here the cloning of a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding a human CGRP1 receptor, which shares significant peptide sequence homology with the human calcitonin receptor, a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Northern blot analysis revealed that the messenger RNA for this receptor is predominantly expressed in the lung and heart. In situ studies showed specific localization of the receptor mRNA to alveolar cells in the lung and to cardiac myocytes in the heart. Stable expression of the cDNA in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells produced specific, high affinity binding sites for CGRP that displayed pharmacological and functional properties very similar to native human CGRP1 receptor. Exposure of these cells to CGRP resulted in a 60-fold increase in cAMP production, which was inhibited in a competitive manner by the CGRP1 receptor antagonist, CGRP-(8-37).",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
8986622,A chondroitin/dermatan sulfate form of CD44 is a receptor for collagen XIV (undulin).,"Collagen XIV, a fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple helices, is expressed in differentiated soft connective tissues and in cartilage. However, a cellular receptor for this protein has not been identified. Here we show that human placental collagen XIV, isolated by a mild and simple two-step method, serves as adhesive protein for a variety of mesenchymal and some epithelial cells. Cell adhesion could be inhibited by preincubation of the collagen XIV substrate with heparin or with the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan decorin and by pretreatment of cells with chondroitinase ABC or heparinase III, suggesting a cell membrane proteoglycan as receptor. Affinity chromatography of 125I-labeled fibroblast cell surface proteins on collagen XIV-Sepharose yielded a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan with a molecular mass of 97-105 kDa after chondroitinase ABC digestion and of 60-70 kDa after further treatment with N-glycosidase F. The eluates contained also some high-molecular-weight material that was susceptible to digestion with heparinase but no detectable integrins. Immunoprecipitation with a specific monoclonal antibody identified the prominent chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan as a member of the CD44 family. The interaction between collagen XIV and cells appears to be finely tuned, since matrix-associated glycosaminoglycans, and particularly proteoglycans like decorin, could compete with cells for the binding site(s) on collagen XIV under physiological conditions.",Experimental cell research,1996
11172728,A combinatorial role of angiopoietin-1 and orphan receptor TIE1 pathways in establishing vascular polarity during angiogenesis.,"Vascular polarity is a fundamental feature of angiogenesis and left-right asymmetry of the vascular network. Contrary to this importance, the molecular basis of vascular polarity is completely unknown. In this report, we show that the combinatorial function of angiopoietin-1 and the orphan receptor TIE1 is critical specifically for the development of the right-hand side venous system but is dispensable for the left-hand side venous system. Furthermore, our current finding reveals the existence of a distinct genetic program for the establishment of the right-hand side and left-hand side vascular networks well before the network asymmetry becomes morphologically discernible.",,
21969550,A complex between contactin-1 and the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRZ controls the development of oligodendrocyte precursor cells.,"The six members of the contactin (CNTN) family of neural cell adhesion molecules are involved in the formation and maintenance of the central nervous system (CNS) and have been linked to mental retardation and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism. Five of the six CNTNs bind to the homologous receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases gamma (PTPRG) and zeta (PTPRZ), but the biological roles of these interactions remain unclear. We report here the cocrystal structure of the carbonic anhydrase-like domain of PTPRZ bound to tandem Ig repeats of CNTN1 and combine these structural data with binding assays to show that PTPRZ binds specifically to CNTN1 expressed at the surface of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Furthermore, analyses of glial cell populations in wild-type and PTPRZ-deficient mice show that the binding of PTPRZ to CNTN1 expressed at the surface of oligodendrocyte precursor cells inhibits their proliferation and promotes their development into mature oligodendrocytes. Overall, these results implicate the PTPRZ/CNTN1 complex as a previously unknown modulator of oligodendrogenesis.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2011

11257134,A dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN)-related protein is highly expressed on human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and promotes HIV-1 infection.,"The discovery of dendritic cell (DC)-specific intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) as a DC-specific ICAM-3 binding receptor that enhances HIV-1 infection of T cells in trans has indicated a potentially important role for adhesion molecules in AIDS pathogenesis. A related molecule called DC-SIGNR exhibits 77% amino acid sequence identity with DC-SIGN. The DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR genes map within a 30-kb region on chromosome 19p13.2-3. Their strong homology and close physical location indicate a recent duplication of the original gene. Messenger RNA and protein expression patterns demonstrate that the DC-SIGN-related molecule is highly expressed on liver sinusoidal cells and in the lymph node but not on DCs, in contrast to DC-SIGN. Therefore, we suggest that a more appropriate name for the DC-SIGN-related molecule is L-SIGN, liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin. We show that in the liver, L-SIGN is expressed by sinusoidal endothelial cells. Functional studies indicate that L-SIGN behaves similarly to DC-SIGN in that it has a high affinity for ICAM-3, captures HIV-1 through gp120 binding, and enhances HIV-1 infection of T cells in trans. We propose that L-SIGN may play an important role in the interaction between liver sinusoidal endothelium and trafficking lymphocytes, as well as function in the pathogenesis of HIV-1.",The Journal of experimental medicine,2001
10085134,A differential requirement for the COOH-terminal region of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in amphiregulin and EGF mitogenic signaling.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediates the actions of a family of bioactive peptides that include epidermal growth factor (EGF) and amphiregulin (AR). Here we have studied AR and EGF mitogenic signaling in EGFR-devoid NR6 fibroblasts that ectopically express either wild type EGFR (WT) or a truncated EGFR that lacks the three major sites of autophosphorylation (c'1000). COOH-terminal truncation of the EGFR significantly impairs the ability of AR to (i) stimulate DNA synthesis, (ii) elicit Elk-1 transactivation, and (iii) generate sustained enzymatic activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. EGFR truncation had no significant effect on AR binding to receptor but did result in defective GRB2 adaptor function. In contrast, EGFR truncation did not impair EGF mitogenic signaling, and in c'1000 cells EGF was able to stimulate the association of ErbB2 with GRB2 and SHC. Elk-1 transactivation was monitored when either ErbB2 or a truncated dominant-negative ErbB2 mutant (ErbB2-(1-813)) was overexpressed in cells. Overexpression of full-length ErbB2 resulted in a strong constitutive transactivation of Elk-1 in c'1000 but only slightly stimulated Elk-1 in WT or parental NR6 cells. Conversely, overexpression of ErbB2-(1-813) inhibited EGF-stimulated Elk-1 transactivation in c'1000 but not in WT cells. Thus, the cytoplasmic tail of the EGFR plays a critical role in AR mitogenic signaling but is dispensable for EGF, since EGF-activated truncated EGFRs can signal through ErbB2.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
11855816,A discrete domain of the human TrkB receptor defines the binding sites for BDNF and NT-4.,"TrkB is a member of the Trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors. In vivo, the extracellular region of TrkB is known to bind, with high affinity, the neurotrophin protein brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). We describe the expression and purification of the second Ig-like domain of human TrkB (TrkBIg(2)) and show, using surface plasmon resonance, that this domain is sufficient to bind BDNF and NT-4 with subnanomolar affinity. BDNF and NT-4 may have therapeutic implications for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. The specificity of binding of the neurotrophins to their receptor TrkB is therefore of interest. We examine the specificity of TrkBIg(2) for all the neurotrophins, and use our molecular model of the BDNF-TrkBIg(2) complex to examine the residues involved in binding. It is hoped that the understanding of specific interactions will allow design of small molecule neurotrophin mimetics.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2002
11009104,A disulfide-linked natural killer cell receptor dimer has higher affinity for HLA-C than wild-type monomer.,"Inhibitory receptors on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells recognize specific MHC class I molecules on target cells and prevent the target cell lysis by NK cells. The killer cell immunoglobulin-related receptors (KIR), KIR2D, found in human, specifically interact with polymorphic HLA-C molecules. The crystal structure of the inhibitory receptor, KIR2DL1, revealed a relationship to the hematopoietic receptor family, suggesting that the signaling mechanism of KIR2D molecules may resemble that of the hematopoietic receptors, and involve KIR2D dimerization. We have engineered a disulfide-linked dimer of KIR2DL1 by introducing a free cysteine at the C-terminal stem region of the receptor. The disulfide-linked KIR2DL1 dimer binds to HLA-Cw4 at a molar ratio of one dimer to one HLA-Cw4 molecule. Furthermore, the covalently-linked KIR2DL1 dimer binds more tightly to HLA-Cw4 than the wild-type monomer, suggesting the occurrence of a second binding event that increases the overall affinity of KIR dimer for HLA-C.",European journal of immunology,2000
8910448,A dominant negative granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor alpha chain reveals the multimeric structure of the receptor complex.,"The receptor for the hemopoietic growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is composed of two chains, both of which belong to the superfamily of cytokine receptors. The alpha chain confers low affinity binding only, whereas the beta chain (betac) confers high affinity binding when associated with alpha. Ectopic expression of both chains of the receptor in murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts results in signal transduction, mitogenesis, and morphologic transformation. The cytoplasmic domain of the GM-CSF receptor alpha subunit (GMR-alpha) comprises 54 amino acids that have been shown to be important for signal transduction through the beta chain. The present study was designed to address the possibility of receptor oligomerization and its functional implication. Cross-linking studies with 125I-GM-CSF on NIH-3T3 transfectants is consistent with the presence of alpha and betac dimers and of receptor oligomers. We have, therefore, generated an inert alpha chain through polymerase chain reaction-mediated truncation of 47 amino acids of the COOH-terminal domain of alpha (alphat), and coexpressed alphat, alpha, and betac in NIH-3T3. In cells in which alphat and alpha are present in stoichiometric proportion within the GM-CSF-binding complex, we provide evidence that alphat is dominant negative over wild type alpha on the basis of two different functional assays: cell proliferation and foci formation. Hence, our results suggest the requirement for at least two functional alpha chains for signal transduction. Together with the cross-linking studies, our data indicate that the functional GMR is an oligomer that contains at least two alpha chains.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996

16210345,A glycoprotein hormone expressed in corticotrophs exhibits unique binding properties on thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor.,"Corticotroph-derived glycoprotein hormone (CGH), also referred to as thyrostimulin, is a noncovalent heterodimer of glycoprotein hormone alpha 2 (GPHA2) and glycoprotein hormone beta 5 (GPHB5). Here, we demonstrate that both subunits of CGH are expressed in the corticotroph cells of the human anterior pituitary, as well as in skin, retina, and testis. CGH activates the TSH receptor (TSHR); (125)I-CGH binding to cells expressing TSHR is saturable, specific, and of high affinity. In competition studies, unlabeled CGH is a potent competitor for (125)I-TSH binding, whereas unlabeled TSH does not compete for (125)I-CGH binding. Binding and competition analyses are consistent with the presence of two binding sites on the TSHR transfected baby hamster kidney cells, one that can interact with either TSH or CGH, and another that binds CGH alone. Transgenic overexpression of GPHB5 in mice produces elevations in serum T(4) levels, reductions in body weight, and proptosis. However, neither transgenic overexpression of GPHA2 nor deletion of GPHB5 produces an overt phenotype in mice. In vivo administration of CGH to mice produces a dose-dependent hyperthyroid phenotype including elevation of T(4) and hypertrophy of cells within the inner adrenal cortex. However, the distinctive expression patterns and binding characteristics of CGH suggest that it has endogenous biological roles that are discrete from those of TSH.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",2006
9192898,A GPI-linked protein that interacts with Ret to form a candidate neurturin receptor.,"Glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) are two structurally related, potent survival factors for sympathetic, sensory and central nervous system neurons. GDNF mediates its actions through a multicomponent receptor system composed of a ligand-binding glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein (designated GDNFR-alpha) and the transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase Ret. In contrast, the mechanism by which the NTN signal is transmitted is not well understood. Here we describe the identification and tissue distribution of a GPI-linked protein (designated NTNR-alpha) that is structurally related to GDNFR-alpha. We further demonstrate that NTNR-alpha binds NTN (K[d] approximately 10 pM) but not GDNF with high affinity; that GDNFR-alpha binds to GDNF but not NTN with high affinity; and that cellular responses to NTN require the presence of NTNR-alpha. Finally, we show that NTN, in the presence of NTNR-alpha, induces tyrosine-phosphorylation of Ret, and that NTN, NTNR-alpha and Ret form a physical complex on the cell surface. These findings identify Ret and NTNR-alpha as signalling and ligand-binding components, respectively, of a receptor for NTN and define a novel family of receptors for neurotrophic and differentiation factors composed of a shared transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase and a ligand-specific GPI-linked protein.",,

The amino acid sequence predicted from complementary DNA clones indicates that the mitogen is a new member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family. This heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) binds to EGF receptors on A-431 epidermoid carcinoma cells and smooth muscle cells, but is a far more potent mitogen for smooth muscle cells than is EGF. HB-EGF is also expressed in cultured human macrophages and may be involved in macrophage-mediated cellular proliferation.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1991

18495663,A high affinity hepatocyte growth factor-binding site in the immunoglobulin-like region of Met.,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its high affinity receptor, the tyrosine kinase Met, play a key role in embryo development and tumor invasion. Both HGF and Met are established targets for cancer therapy. However, the mechanism of their interaction is complex and remains elusive. HGF is secreted as a monomeric precursor (pro-HGF) that binds to but does not activate Met. Mature HGF is a alpha/beta heterodimer containing a high affinity Met-binding site in the alpha-chain (HGF-alpha) and a low affinity Met-binding site in the beta-chain (HGF-beta). The extracellular portion of Met contains a semaphorin (Sema) domain, a cysteine-rich hinge (plexin-semaphorin-integrin), and four immunoglobulin-like domains (immunoglobulin-like regions in plexins and transcription factors (IPT) 1-4). HGF-beta binds to Sema through a low affinity contact. The domain of Met responsible for high affinity binding to HGF-alpha has not been identified yet. Here we show that this long sought after binding site lies in the immunoglobulin-like region of Met and more precisely in IPT 3 and 4. We also show that IPT 3 and 4 are sufficient to transmit the signal for kinase activation to the cytoplasm, although the lack of Sema makes the receptor equally sensitive to mature HGF and pro-HGF. Finally, we provide evidence that soluble Met-derived proteins containing either the low affinity or high affinity HGF-binding site antagonize HGF-induced invasive growth both in vitro and in xenografts. These data suggest that the immunoglobulin-like region of Met cooperates with the Sema domain in binding to HGF and in controlling Met kinase activity. Although the IPT-HGF-alpha interaction provides binding strength, the Sema-HGF-beta contact confers selective sensitivity to the active form of the ligand.",,
13679391,"A high endothelial venule-expressing promiscuous chemokine receptor DARC can bind inflammatory, but not lymphoid, chemokines and is dispensable for lymphocyte homing under physiological conditions.","Chemokines displayed on the luminal surface of blood vessels play pivotal roles in inflammatory and homeostatic leukocyte trafficking in vivo. However, the mechanisms underlying the functional regulation of chemokines on the endothelial cell surface remain ill-defined. A promiscuous chemokine receptor, the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), has been implicated in the regulation of chemokine functions. Here we show that DARC is selectively expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in the high endothelial venules (HEV) of unstimulated lymph nodes (LN). To examine the biological significance of DARC expression in HEV, we performed competitive binding experiments with 20 different chemokines. The results showed that DARC selectively bound distinct members of the pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL2, CCL5 and CCL7, but not lymphoid chemokines such as CCL21, CCL19, CXCL12 and CXCL13 that are normally expressed in HEV. CCL2 bound to DARC failed to induce a significant cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation in CCR2B-expressing cells, whereas the free form of CCL2 induced a distinct [Ca(2+)] elevation, suggesting that DARC down-regulates activities of pro-inflammatory chemokines upon binding. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding DARC did not induce any obvious changes in the cell number or leukocyte subsets in the peripheral and mesenteric LN. Neither did DARC deficiency significantly affect lymphocyte migration into LN. These results suggest that DARC may be a scavenger for pro-inflammatory chemokines, but not a presenting molecule for lymphoid chemokines at HEV and that it is probably functionally dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking to HEV-bearing lymphoid tissues under physiological conditions.",,
12554737,A highly selective CCR2 chemokine agonist encoded by human herpesvirus 6.,"The chemokine-like, secreted protein product of the U83 gene from human herpesvirus 6, here named vCCL4, was chemically synthesized to be characterized in a complete library of the 18 known human chemokine receptors expressed individually in stably transfected cell lines. vCCL4 was found to cause calcium mobilization as efficiently as the endogenous chemokine ligand CCL2 through the CCR2 receptor, whereas the virally encoded chemokine did not affect any of the other 17 human chemokine receptors tested. Mutual cross-desensitization between CCL2 and vCCL4 was demonstrated in the CCR2-transfected cells. The affinity of vCCL4 for the CCR2 receptor was 79 nm as determined in competition binding against radioactively labeled CCL2. In the murine pre-B lymphocyte cell line L1.2 stably transfected with the CCR2 receptor, vCCL4 acted as a relatively low potency but highly efficacious chemoattractant being equally or more efficacious in causing cell migration than CCL2 and CCL7 and considerably more efficacious than CCL8 and CCL13. It is concluded that human herpesvirus 6 encodes a highly selective and efficacious CCR2 agonist, which will attract CCR2 expressing cells, for example macrophages and monocytes, conceivably for the virus to infect and to establish latency in. It is suggested that vCCL4 during reactivation of the virus in for example monocyte-derived microglia could perhaps be involved in the pathogenesis of the CCR2-dependent disease, multiple sclerosis.",,
15607823,A HLA-Cw6 specific single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) recognizing a natural killer cell receptor epitope.,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules induce inhibitory signals on natural killer (NK) cells via killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). We recently reported a human single-chain antibody (scFv#1), which recognizes an epitope on HLA-Cw6 (genotype: *0602). Flow cytometry showed scFv#1 binding to HLA-Cw6 (strong) and also to HLA-Cw2, 4, 5 (very weak) but not to HLA-Cw1, 3, 7, 8. The presumptive epitope of the antibody fragment, which includes residues Asn77 and Lys80 was verified by introducing point mutations into HLA-Cw6 encoding cDNAs. Asn77 --> Ser77 (N77S) and Lys80- -> Asn80 (K80N) mutants of Cw6 lost scFv#1 binding capacity whereas an additional mutation at aa position 90 (Asp-->Ala, D90A) did not influence scFv#1 binding characteristics. Since residues 77 and 80 of HLA-C are directly involved in KIR/MHC interaction, we expected the induction of target cell lysis upon addition of scFv#1 when bringing NK and HLA-Cw6 positive cells together. To prove this interference, we performed Cr-release assays, using Cw*0602 and mock-transfected K562 erythroleukemia cells as targets and freshly prepared peripheral blood NK cells as effector cells. scFv#1 appeared to influence KIR on ligand binding and restored lysis at low effector to target (E/T) ratios. Pan HLA class I antibody W6/32 did not show such effects. Taken together scFv#1 binding patterns with mutagenized HLA-Cw6 and Cr-release assays are strong evidence that the scFv#1 epitope on HLA-Cw6 is at or close to the binding site of CD158a.",,
9367155,A homologue of the TNF receptor and its ligand enhance T-cell growth and dendritic-cell function.,"Dendritic cells are rare haematopoietic cells that reside in a number of organs and tissues. By capturing, processing and presenting antigens to T cells, dendritic cells are essential for immune surveillance and the regulation of specific immunity. Several members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily are integral to the regulation of the immune response. These structurally related proteins modulate cellular functions ranging from proliferation and differentiation to inflammation and cell survival or deaths. The functional activity of dendritic cells is greatly increased by signalling through the TNFR family member CD40. Here we report the characterization of RANK (for receptor activator of NF-kappaB), a new member of the TNFR family derived from dendritic cells, and the isolation of a RANK ligand (RANKL) by direct expression screening. RANKL augments the ability of dendritic cells to stimulate naive T-cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, and increases the survival of RANK+ T cells generated with interleukin-4 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Thus RANK and RANKL seem to be important regulators of interactions between T cells and dendritic cells.",,
10190900,A human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G-specific receptor expressed on all natural killer cells.,"Human natural killer (NK) cells express several killer cell immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors (KIRs) that inhibit their cytotoxicity upon recognition of human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules on target cells. Additional members of the KIR family, including some that deliver activation signals, have unknown ligand specificity and function. One such KIR, denoted KIR2DL4, is structurally divergent from other KIRs in the configuration of its two extracellular Ig domains and of its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Here we show that recombinant soluble KIR2DL4 binds to cells expressing HLA-G but not to cells expressing other HLA class I molecules. Unlike other HLA class I-specific KIRs, which are clonally distributed on NK cells, KIR2DL4 is expressed at the surface of all NK cells. Furthermore, functional transfer of KIR2DL4 into the cell line NK-92 resulted in inhibition of lysis of target cells that express HLA-G, but not target cells that express other class I molecules including HLA-E. Therefore, given that HLA-G expression is restricted to fetal trophoblast cells, KIR2DL4 may provide important signals to maternal NK decidual cells that interact with trophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface during pregnancy.",The Journal of experimental medicine,1999

We identified 3186 mostly novel interactions among 1705 proteins, resulting in a large, highly connected network. Independent pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays validated the overall quality of the Y2H interactions. Using topological and GO criteria, a scoring system was developed to define 911 high-confidence interactions among 401 proteins. Furthermore, the network was searched for interactions linking uncharacterized gene products and human disease proteins to regulatory cellular pathways. Two novel Axin-1 interactions were validated experimentally, characterizing ANP32A and CRMP1 as modulators of Wnt signaling.

Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, this gene encodes a 418 amino acid protein displaying sequence similarity, particularly within putative transmembrane domains, with the recently cloned human SSTR1 (62%), SSTR2 (64%) and SSTR4 (58%) receptors. Membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transiently expressing the human SSTR3 gene bound [125I]Leu8,D-Trp22,Tyr25 SST-28 in a saturable manner with high affinity (approximately 200 pM) and with rank order of potency (D-Trp8 SST-14 > SST-14 > SMS-201-995 > SST-28) indicative of a somatostatin-14 selective receptor. The pharmacological profile of the expressed human SSTR3 receptor is similar but not identical to that reported for the rat homolog [(1992) J. Biol.

Northern blot analysis reveals the presence of an SSTR3 mRNA species of approximately 5 kb in various regions of the monkey brain, including the frontal cortex, cerebellum, medulla, amygdala, with little or no SSTR3 mRNA detectable in brain regions such as the striatum, hippocampus, and olfactory tubercle. The SSTR3 receptor gene maps to human chromosome 22. The existence of at least four distinct human genes encoding somatostatin-14 selective receptors with diverse pharmacological specificities may help to account for some of the multiple biological actions of somatostatin under normal and pathological conditions.",FEBS letters,1993
10399920,A ligand-gated association between cytoplasmic domains of UNC5 and DCC family receptors converts netrin-induced growth cone attraction to repulsion.,"Netrins are bifunctional: they attract some axons and repel others. Netrin receptors of the Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) family are implicated in attraction and those of the UNC5 family in repulsion, but genetic evidence also suggests involvement of the DCC protein UNC-40 in some cases of repulsion. To test whether these proteins form a receptor complex for repulsion, we studied the attractive responses of Xenopus spinal axons to netrin-1, which are mediated by DCC. We show that attraction is converted to repulsion by expression of UNC5 proteins in these cells, that this repulsion requires DCC function, that the UNC5 cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to effect the conversion, and that repulsion can be initiated by netrin-1 binding to either UNC5 or DCC. The isolated cytoplasmic domains of DCC and UNC5 proteins interact directly, but this interaction is repressed in the context of the full-length proteins. We provide evidence that netrin-1 triggers the formation of a receptor complex of DCC and UNC5 proteins and simultaneously derepresses the interaction between their cytoplasmic domains, thereby converting DCC-mediated attraction to UNC5/DCC-mediated repulsion.",,

Secreted LT-alpha is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons; however, these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface LT-alpha-LT-beta complex. A receptor specific for human LT-beta was identified, which suggests that cell surface LT may have functions that are distinct from those of secreted LT-alpha.",,

Here we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of a mammalian receptor, CFK-43a, which specifically binds BMP-2 and BMP-4. This molecule is a member of the serine/threonine kinase receptor family which includes receptors for other TGF-beta superfamily members. CFK-43a binds other BMP family members with lower affinity, but does not bind TGF-beta.

12165561,A missense mutation disrupting a dibasic prohormone processing site in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) increases susceptibility to early-onset obesity through a novel molecular mechanism.,"The functional loss of both alleles of the human pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene leads to a very rare syndrome of hypoadrenalism, red hair and early-onset obesity. In order to examine whether more subtle genetic variants in POMC might contribute to early-onset obesity, the coding region of the gene was sequenced in 262 Caucasian subjects with a history of severe obesity from childhood. Two children were found to be heterozygous for a missense mutation, R236G, which disrupts the dibasic cleavage site between beta melanocyte-stimulating hormone (beta-MSH) and beta-endorphin. Beta-TC3 cells transfected with the mutant POMC cDNA produced a mutant beta-MSH/beta-endorphin fusion protein. This fusion protein bound to the human melanocortin-4 receptor (hMC4R) with an affinity similar to its natural ligands, but had a markedly reduced ability to activate the receptor. This variant co-segregated with early-onset obesity over three generations in one family and was absent in 412 normal weight UK Caucasian controls. Combining the results in UK Caucasians with a new case-control study in French subjects and three previously published reports, mutations disrupting this processing site were present in 0.88% of subjects with early-onset obesity and 0.22% of normal-weight controls. These results suggest that the R236G mutation may confer an inherited susceptibility to obesity through the production of an aberrant fusion protein that has the capacity to interfere with central melanocortin signalling.",Human molecular genetics,2002
8756477,A natural kinase-deficient variant of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1.,"A fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 variant missing 37 amino acids from the carboxy-terminal tyrosine kinase catalytic domain was discovered in human lung fibroblasts and several other human cell lines. The receptor variant binds specifically to acidic fibroblast growth factor but has no tyrosine kinase activity. It was found that cellular transfectants expressing the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 variant are mitogenically inactive and ligand binding to the receptor causes neither receptor autophosphorylation nor phospholipase C-gamma transphosphorylation. The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 variant therefore represents an inactive receptor for acidic fibroblast growth factor. Since both kinase and kinase-deficient receptor forms are expressed in cells, it is conceivable that the kinase-deficient receptor plays an important role in regulating cellular responses elicited by acidic fibroblast growth factor stimulation.",Biochemistry,1996
9062194,A new cytokine-receptor binding mode revealed by the crystal structure of the IL-1 receptor with an antagonist.,"Inflammation, regardless of whether it is provoked by infection or by tissue damage, starts with the activation of macrophages which initiate a cascade of inflammatory responses by producing the cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (ref. 1). Three naturally occurring ligands for the IL-1 receptor (IL1R) exist: the agonists IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and the IL-1-receptor antagonist IL1RA (ref. 2). IL-1 is the only cytokine for which a naturally occurring antagonist is known. Here we describe the crystal structure at 2.7 A resolution of the soluble extracellular part of type-I IL1R complexed with IL1RA. The receptor consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains. Domains 1 and 2 are tightly linked, but domain three is completely separate and connected by a flexible linker. Residues of all three domains contact the antagonist and include the five critical IL1RA residues which were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A region that is important for biological function in IL-1beta, the 'receptor trigger site' is not in direct contact with the receptor in the IL1RA complex. Modelling studies suggest that this IL-1beta trigger site might induce a movement of domain 3.",,
14692877,A new ephrin-A1 isoform (ephrin-A1b) with altered receptor binding properties abrogates the cleavage of ephrin-A1a.,"Ephrins are ligands for the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, which play important roles in patterning nervous and vascular systems. Ephrin-A1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ligand that binds to the EphA receptor tyrosine kinases. In the present study, we have identified a new ephrin-A1 isoform, denoted ephrin-A1b (ephrin-A1 isoform b). Compared with the originally described ephrin-A1 sequence, ephrin-A1a [Holzman, Marks and Dixit (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 5830-5838], ephrin-A1b lacks a segment of 22 amino acids (residues 131-152). At the transcript level, exon 3 is spliced out in the transcript encoding ephrin-A1b. Transfection of HEK-293T cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) with an ephrin-A1b-expressing plasmid resulted in a significant expression of the protein on the cell surface. However, soluble EphA2 receptor (EphA2-Fc) bound weakly to ephrin-A1b-expressing transfectants, but bound strongly to ephrin-A1a-expressing transfectants. Ephrins have been shown to undergo regulated cleavage after interaction with their receptors. This process is inhibited by co-expression of ephrin-A1a and ephrin-A1b, indicating that ephrin-A1b influences the cleavage process. Taken together, these findings indicate that this newly described isoform may regulate the function of its ephrin-A1a counterpart.",The Biochemical journal,2004

10318773,A newly identified member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TR6) suppresses LIGHT-mediated apoptosis.,"TR6 (decoy receptor 3 (DcR3)) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. TR6 mRNA is expressed in lung tissues and colon adenocarcinoma, SW480. In addition, the expression of TR6 mRNA was shown in the endothelial cell line and induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation. Here, we demonstrate that TR6 specifically binds two cellular ligands, LIGHT (herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)-L) and Fas ligand (FasL/CD95L). These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
9130652,"A novel 4-kb interleukin-13 receptor alpha mRNA expressed in human B, T, and endothelial cells encoding an alternate type-II interleukin-4/interleukin-13 receptor.","A 4 kb human interleukin-13 receptor (IL-13R) chain cDNA was cloned from a B cell cDNA library using expressed sequence tags homologous to mouse IL-13R as probes. The deduced protein sequence shows a significant level of sequence identity with the IL-5R and the human IL-13R identified recently by expression cloning. The cytoplasmic region is very highly conserved between human and mouse homologs and contains a consensus binding motif for a signal transducer and activator of transcription. The cDNA encodes a protein binding IL-13 when expressed alone which participates in a receptor complex for both IL-4 and IL-13 when expressed in conjunction with the IL-4R alpha chain. Transcripts for this IL-13R chain could be detected in most tissues and organs studied and in T, B, endothelial cells, basophilic, immature mast cell, and monocytic cell lines. The pattern of expression is different from the other recently cloned IL-13R molecule, and correlates with sites where IL-4 and IL-13 signaling is known to occur. This novel receptor is therefore likely to be implicated in reactions involved in IgE responses, T helper 2 differentiation, adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium, and therefore in pathological phenomena such as allergy, atopy, and asthma.",European journal of immunology,1997
10975800,A novel chemokine ligand for CCR10 and CCR3 expressed by epithelial cells in mucosal tissues.,"Mucosae-associated epithelial chemokine (MEC) is a novel chemokine whose mRNA is most abundant in salivary gland, with strong expression in other mucosal sites, including colon, trachea, and mammary gland. MEC is constitutively expressed by epithelial cells; MEC mRNA is detected in cultured bronchial and mammary gland epithelial cell lines and in epithelia isolated from salivary gland and colon using laser capture microdissection, but not in the endothelial, hemolymphoid, or fibroblastic cell lines tested. Although MEC is poorly expressed in skin, its closest homologue is the keratinocyte-expressed cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK; CCL27), and MEC supports chemotaxis of transfected lymphoid cells expressing CCR10, a known CTACK receptor. In contrast to CTACK, however, MEC also supports migration through CCR3. Consistent with this, MEC attracts eosinophils in addition to memory lymphocyte subsets. These results suggest an important role for MEC in the physiology of extracutaneous epithelial tissues, including diverse mucosal organs.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2000
10749887,"A novel cytokine receptor-ligand pair. Identification, molecular characterization, and in vivo immunomodulatory activity.","As part of a large scale effort to discover novel secreted proteins, a cDNA encoding a novel cytokine was identified. Alignments of the sequence of the new protein, designated IL-17B, suggest it to be a homolog of the recently described T cell-derived cytokine, IL-17. By Northern analysis, EST distribution and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, mRNA was detected in many cell types. A novel type I transmembrane protein, identified in an EST data base by homology to IL-17R, was found to bind specifically IL-17B, as determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis, flow cytometry, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Readily detectable transcription of IL-17BR was restricted to human kidney, pancreas, liver, brain, and intestines and only a few of the many cell lines tested. By using a rodent ortholog of IL-17BR as a probe, IL-17BR message was found to be drastically up-regulated during intestinal inflammation elicited by indomethacin treatment in rats. In addition, intraperitoneal injection of IL-17B purified from Chinese hamster ovary cells caused marked neutrophil migration in normal mice, in a specific and dose-dependent manner. Together these results suggest that IL-17B may be a novel proinflammatory cytokine acting on a restricted set of target cell types. They also demonstrate the strength of genomic approaches in the unraveling of novel biological pathways.",,
16087676,A novel form of neurotensin post-translationally modified by arginylation.,"A novel bioactive form of neurotensin post-translationally modified at a Glu residue was isolated from porcine intestine. Purification of the peptide was guided by detection of intracellular Ca2+ release in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. Using high resolution accurate mass analysis on an ion trap Fourier transform mass spectrometer, the post-translational modification was identified as arginine linked to the gamma-carboxyl of Glu via an isopeptide bond, and we named the newly identified peptide ""arginylated neurotensin"" (R-NT, N-(neurotensin-C5-4-yl)arginine). Although arginylation is a known modification of N-terminal amino groups in proteins, its presence at a Glu side chain is unique. The finding places neurotensin among the few physiologically active peptides that occur both in post-translationally modified and unmodified forms. Pharmacologically, we characterized R-NT for its ligand activity on three known neurotensin receptors, NTR1, -2, and -3, and found that R-NT has similar pharmacological properties to those of neurotensin, however, with a slightly higher affinity to all three receptors. We expressed the intracellular receptor NTR3 as a soluble protein secreted into the cell culture medium, which allowed characterization of its R-NT and neurotensin binding properties. The creation of soluble NTR3 also provides a potential tool for neutralizing neurotensin action in vivo and in vitro. We have shown that SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells express NTR1 and NTR3 but not NTR2, suggesting that the Ca2+ mobilization elicited by R-NT is via NTR1.",,
12652295,A novel function for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP3): inhibition of angiogenesis by blockage of VEGF binding to VEGF receptor-2.,"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP3) is one of four members of a family of proteins that were originally classified according to their ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). TIMP3, which encodes a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, is mutated in Sorsby fundus dystrophy, a macular degenerative disease with submacular choroidal neovascularization. In this study we demonstrate the ability of TIMP3 to inhibit vascular endothelial factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis and identify the potential mechanism by which this occurs: TIMP3 blocks the binding of VEGF to VEGF receptor-2 and inhibits downstream signaling and angiogenesis. This property seems to be independent of its MMP-inhibitory activity, indicating a new function for this molecule.",Nature medicine,2003
17623663,"A novel function of syndecan-2, suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation, which causes suppression of metastasis.","The syndecans comprise a family of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans exhibiting complex biological functions involving the interaction of heparan sulfate side chains with a variety of soluble and insoluble heparin-binding extracellular ligands. Here we demonstrate an inverse correlation between the expression level of syndecan-2 and the metastatic potential of three clones derived from Lewis lung carcinoma 3LL. This correlation was proved to be a causal relationship, because transfection of syndecan-2 into the higher metastatic clone resulted in the suppression of both spontaneous and experimental metastases to the lung. Although the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and its cell surface activators, such as membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, were similar regardless of the metastatic potentials of the clones, elevated activation of MMP-2 was observed in the higher metastatic clone. Removal of heparan sulfate from the cell surface of low metastatic cells by treatment with heparitinase-I promoted MMP-2 activation, and transfection of syndecan-2 into highly metastatic cells suppressed MMP-2 activation. Furthermore, transfection of mutated syndecan-2 lacking glycosaminoglycan attachment sites into highly metastatic cells did not have any suppressive effect on MMP-2 activation, suggesting that this suppression was mediated by the heparan sulfate side chains of syndecan-2. Actually, MMP-2 was found to exhibit a strong binding ability to heparin, the dissociation constant value being 62 nM. These results indicate a novel function of syndecan-2, which acts as a suppressor for MMP-2 activation, causing suppression of metastasis in at least the metastatic system used in the present study.",,
11856343,A novel gain-of-function mutation of the integrin alpha2 VWFA domain.,"Integrin alpha2beta1 is the major receptor for collagens in human tissues, being involved in cell adhesion and the control of collagen and collagenase gene expression. The collagen binding site of alpha2beta1 has been localized to the alpha2 von Willebrand Factor type A (VWFA) domain (A-domain or I-domain) and the residues responsible for the interaction with collagen have been mapped. We report a study of alpha2 VWFA domain in which residue E318, which lies outside the collagen binding site, is mutated to tryptophan, showing that this is a gain-of-function mutation. Recombinant alpha2-E318W VWFA domain showed elevated and specific binding to collagen I compared with the wild-type. Side chain hydrophobicity was important for the gain-of-function as elevated binding was seen with E318I and E318Y, but not with E318R. The E318W mutation had additional effects on VWFA domain properties as alpha2-E318W VWFA domain differed from the wild-type in its cation preferences for ligand binding and in binding to monoclonal antibody JA203, which bound at a site distal to E318. The gain-of-function effect was not restricted to binding to collagen I as alpha2-E318W also showed elevated binding to collagen IV, collagen I C-propeptide, laminin and E-cadherin. Binding to these ligands was inhibited by collagen peptide containing the GFOGER motif, indicating that these bound to the VWFA domain by a similar mechanism to collagen I. These data indicate that residue E318 plays a novel and important role in modulating alpha2 VWFA domain--ligand binding and may be involved in the conformational changes associated with its regulation.",,
9147651,A novel human homologue of the Drosophila frizzled wnt receptor gene binds wingless protein and is in the Williams syndrome deletion at 7q11.23.,"Williams syndrome (WS) is a developmental disorder with a characteristic personality and cognitive profile that is associated, in most cases, with a 2 Mb deletion of part of chromosome band 7q11.23. By applying CpG island cloning methods to cosmids from the deletion region, we have identified a new gene, called FZD3. Dosage blotting of DNA from 11 WS probands confirmed that it is located within the commonly deleted region. Sequence comparisons revealed that FZD3, encoding a 591 amino acid protein, is a novel member of a seven transmembrane domain receptor family that are mammalian homologs of the Drosophila tissue polarity gene frizzled. FZD3 is expressed predominantly in brain, testis, eye, skeletal muscle and kidney. Recently, frizzled has been identified as the receptor for the wingless (wg) protein in Drosophila. We show that Drosophila as well as human cells, when transfected with FZD3 expression constructs, bind Wg protein. In mouse, the wg homologous Wnt1 gene is involved in early development of a large domain of the central nervous system encompassing much of the midbrain and rostral metencephalon. The potential function of FZD3 in transmitting a Wnt protein signal in the human brain and other tissues suggests that heterozygous deletion of the FZD3 gene could contribute to the WS phenotype.",Human molecular genetics,1997

We have identified a cDNA encoding a fourth alpha chain, alpha d, that associates with CD18. The alpha d subunit is more closely related to CD11b and CD11c than to CD11a. This integrin is expressed at moderate levels on myelomonocytic cell lines and subsets of peripheral blood leukocytes, and more strongly on tissue-compartmentalized cells such as foam cells, specialized macrophages found in aortic fatty streaks that may develop into atherosclerotic lesions.

10882119,A novel ligand of the formyl peptide receptor: annexin I regulates neutrophil extravasation by interacting with the FPR.,"The glucocorticoid-regulated protein annexin I (lipocortin I) has been shown to mediate antiinflammatory activities of glucocorticoids, but the molecular basis of its action has remained elusive. Here we show that annexin I acts through the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) on human neutrophils. Peptides derived from the unique N-terminal domain of annexin I serve as FPR ligands and trigger different signaling pathways in a dose-dependent manner. Lower peptide concentrations possibly found in inflammatory situations elicit Ca2+ transients without fully activating the MAP kinase pathway. This causes a specific inhibition of the transendothelial migration of neutrophils and a desensitization of neutrophils toward a chemoattractant challenge. These findings identify annexin I peptides as novel, endogenous FPR ligands and establish a mechanistic basis of annexin I-mediated antiinflammatory effects.",Molecular cell,2000
1374383,A novel mechanism for controlling the activity of alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Multiple regulatory sites for 39-kDa receptor-associated protein.,"The alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR/LRP) consists of two polypeptides, 515 and 85 kDa, that are noncovalently associated. A 39-kDa polypeptide, termed the receptor-associated protein (RAP), interacts with the 515-kDa subunit after biosynthesis of these molecules and remains associated on the cell surface. This molecule regulates ligand binding of alpha 2MR/LRP (Herz, J., Goldstein, J. L., Strickland, D. K., Ho, Y. K., and Brown, M. S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21232-21238). Titration and binding studies indicate that RAP binds to two equivalent binding sites on alpha 2MR/LRP, with a KD of 14 nM. Heterologous ligand displacement experiments demonstrated that RAP completely inhibits the binding of 125I-activated alpha 2M to human fibroblasts and to the purified alpha 2MR/LRP, with a Ki of 23 and 26 nM, respectively. A direct correlation between the degree of binding of RAP to the receptor and the degree of ligand inhibition was observed, indicating that as the RAP binding sites are saturated, alpha 2MR/LRP loses its ability to bind ligands. Thus, the amount of RAP bound to alpha 2MR/LRP dictates the level of receptor activity. A model is proposed in which alpha 2MR/LRP contains multiple ligand binding sites, each regulated by a separate RAP site.",,
12897152,A novel mechanism for Wnt activation of canonical signaling through the LRP6 receptor.,"LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is a Wnt coreceptor in the canonical signaling pathway, which plays essential roles in embryonic development. We demonstrate here that wild-type LRP6 forms an inactive dimer through interactions mediated by epidermal growth factor repeat regions within the extracellular domain. A truncated LRP6 comprising its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains is expressed as a constitutively active monomer whose signaling ability is inhibited by forced dimerization. Conversely, Wnts are shown to activate canonical signaling through LRP6 by inducing an intracellular conformational switch which relieves allosteric inhibition imposed on the intracellular domains. Thus, Wnt canonical signaling through LRP6 establishes a novel mechanism for receptor activation which is opposite to the general paradigm of ligand-induced receptor oligomerization.",,
11739188,"A novel Notch ligand, Dll4, induces T-cell leukemia/lymphoma when overexpressed in mice by retroviral-mediated gene transfer.","Notch receptors mediate cell-fate decisions through interaction with specific ligands during development. The biological role of a novel Notch ligand, Dll4, in mice was explored by reconstituting lethally irradiated mice with bone marrow (BM) cells transduced with Dll4 retroviral vector. White blood cell and lymphocyte counts in Dll4-overexpressing mice were reduced at the early stage of reconstitution but increased significantly at approximately 10 weeks after BM transplantation. BM, spleen, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood of Dll4-overexpressing mice contained predominantly CD4(+)CD8(+) T cells and virtually lacked B cells. The Dll4-overexpressing mice eventually developed a lethal phenotype that was characterized by the progression of a T-cell lymphoproliferative disease (restricted to BM and lymphoid tissues) to transplantable monoclonal T-cell leukemia/lymphoma scattered to multiple organs. Results suggest that the interaction of Dll4 with Notch1 may provide key signals for T-cell development.",Blood,2001
10882063,A novel proteolytic cleavage involved in Notch signaling: the role of the disintegrin-metalloprotease TACE.,"The Notch1 receptor is presented at the cell membrane as a heterodimer after constitutive processing by a furin-like convertase. Ligand binding induces the proteolytic release of Notch intracellular domain by a gamma-secretase-like activity. This domain translocates to the nucleus and interacts with the DNA-binding protein CSL, resulting in transcriptional activation of target genes. Here we show that an additional processing event occurs in the extracellular part of the receptor, preceding cleavage by the gamma-secretase-like activity. Purification of the activity accounting for this cleavage in vitro shows that it is due to TACE (TNFalpha-converting enzyme), a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain) family of metalloproteases. Furthermore, experiments carried out on TACE-/- bone marrow-derived monocytic precursor cells suggest that this metalloprotease plays a prominent role in the activation of the Notch pathway.",Molecular cell,2000
10598591,A novel spliced variant of the type 1 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor with a deletion in the seventh transmembrane domain present in the human pregnant term myometrium and fetal membranes.,"CRH exerts its actions via activation of specific G protein-coupled receptors, which exist in two types, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2, and arise from different genes with multiple spliced variants. RT-PCR amplification of CRH receptor sequences from human myometrium and fetal membranes yielded cDNAs that encode a novel CRH-R type 1 spliced variant. This variant (CRH-R1d) is present in the human pregnant myometrium at term only, which suggests a physiologically important role at the end of human pregnancy and labor. The amino acid sequence of CRH-R1d is identical to the CRH-R1alpha receptor except that it contains an exon deletion resulting in the absence of 14 amino acids in the predicted seventh transmembrane domain. Binding studies in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the CRH-R1d or CRH-R1alpha receptors revealed that the deletion does not change the binding characteristics of the variant receptor. In contrast, studies on the G protein activation demonstrated that CRH-R1d is not well coupled to the four subtypes of G proteins (G(s), G(i), G(o), G(q)) that CRH-R1alpha can activate. These data suggest that although the deleted segment is not important for CRH binding, it plays a crucial role in CRH receptor signal transduction. Second messenger studies of the variant receptor showed that CRH and CRH-like peptides can stimulate the adenylate cyclase system, with reduced sensitivity and potency by 10-fold compared with the CRH-R1alpha. Furthermore, CRH failed to stimulate inositol trisphosphate production. Coexpression studies between the CRH-R1d or CRH-R1alpha showed that this receptor does not play a role as a dominant negative receptor for CRH.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",1999

In contrast, YM-355179 did not affect the binding of CCL5 to CCR1 or CCR5. In functional assays, YM-355179 inhibited CCL11-induced, intracellular Ca(2+) influx, chemotaxis, and eosinophil degranulation with IC(50) values of 8.0, 24, and 29 nM, respectively. YM-355179 did not, however, affect any CC chemokine receptor (CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, or CCR5)-mediated Ca(2+) influx signals. Furthermore, oral administration of YM-355179 (1 mg/kg) inhibited CCL11-induced shape change of whole blood eosinophils in cynomolgus monkeys. Intravenous injection of YM-355179 (1 mg/kg) also inhibited eosinophil infiltration into airways of cynomolgus monkeys after segmental bronchoprovocation with CCL11.

We identified 221 molecular associations and 80 previously unknown interactors, including 10 new functional modulators of the pathway. This systems approach provides significant insight into the logic of the TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B pathway and is generally applicable to other pathways relevant to human disease.",Nature cell biology,2004
11978642,A potent and highly selective VPAC2 agonist enhances glucose-induced insulin release and glucose disposal: a potential therapy for type 2 diabetes.,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) activate two shared receptors, VPAC1 and VPAC2. Activation of VPAC1 has been implicated in elevating glucose output, whereas activation of VPAC2 may be involved in insulin secretion. A hypothesis that a VPAC2-selective agonist would enhance glucose disposal by stimulating insulin secretion without causing increased hepatic glucose production was tested using a novel selective agonist of VPAC2. This agonist, BAY 55-9837, was generated through site-directed mutagenesis based on sequence alignments of PACAP, VIP, and related analogs. The peptide bound to VPAC2 with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 0.65 nmol/l and displayed >100-fold selectivity over VPAC1. BAY 55-9837 stimulated glucose-dependent insulin secretion in isolated rat and human pancreatic islets, increased insulin synthesis in purified rat islets, and caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma insulin levels in fasted rats, with a half-maximal stimulatory concentration of 3 pmol/kg. Continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion of the peptide reduced the glucose area under the curve following an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. The peptide had effects on intestinal water retention and mean arterial blood pressure in rats, but only at much higher doses. BAY 55-9837 may be a useful therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",Diabetes,2002
10206645,A presenilin-1-dependent gamma-secretase-like protease mediates release of Notch intracellular domain.,"Signalling through the receptor protein Notch, which is involved in crucial cell-fate decisions during development, requires ligand-induced cleavage of Notch. This cleavage occurs within the predicted transmembrane domain, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), and is reminiscent of gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), a critical event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A deficiency in presenilin-1 (PS1) inhibits processing of APP by gamma-secretase in mammalian cells, and genetic interactions between Notch and PS1 homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that the presenilins may modulate the Notch signalling pathway. Here we report that, in mammalian cells, PS1 deficiency also reduces the proteolytic release of NICD from a truncated Notch construct, thus identifying the specific biochemical step of the Notch signalling pathway that is affected by PS1. Moreover, several gamma-secretase inhibitors block this same step in Notch processing, indicating that related protease activities are responsible for cleavage within the predicted transmembrane domains of Notch and APP. Thus the targeting of gamma-secretase for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease may risk toxicity caused by reduced Notch signalling.",,
9607765,A prolactin-releasing peptide in the brain.,"Hypothalamic peptide hormones regulate the secretion of most of the anterior pituitary hormones, that is, growth hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropin. These peptides do not regulate the secretion of prolactin, at least in a specific manner, however. The peptides act through specific receptors, which are referred to as seven-transmembrane-domain receptors or G-protein-coupled receptors. Although prolactin is important in pregnancy and lactation in mammals, and is involved in the development of the mammary glands and the promotion of milk synthesis, a specific prolactin-releasing hormone has remained unknown. Here we identify a potent candidate for such a hormone. We first proposed that there may still be unknown peptide hormone factors that control pituitary function through seven-transmembrane-domain receptors. We isolated the complementary DNA encoding an 'orphan' receptor (that is, one for which the ligand is unknown). This receptor, hGR3, is specifically expressed in the human pituitary. We then searched for the hGR3 ligand in the hypothalamus and identified a new peptide, which shares no sequence similarity with known peptides and proteins, as an endogenous ligand. We show that this ligand is a potent prolactin-releasing factor for rat anterior pituitary cells; we have therefore named this peptide prolactin-releasing peptide.",Nature,1998
8248239,A receptor for interleukin 10 is related to interferon receptors.,"We isolated cDNAs encoding a mouse interleukin 10 receptor (mIL-10R) from mouse mast cell and macrophage cell lines. The two cDNAs are substantially identical and express an approximately 110-kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells, which binds mIL-10 specifically. A mouse pro-B-cell line (Ba/F3) expressing transfected recombinant mIL-10R binds IL-10 with high affinity (approximately 70 pM) and proliferates in response to mIL-10. mIL-10R is structurally related to interferon receptors (IFNRs). Since IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, a possible implication of this relationship interaction of IL-10R and IFN-gamma R or their signaling pathways.",,
10811223,A receptor for phosphatidylserine-specific clearance of apoptotic cells.,"cytosis of cellular corpses. During apoptosis, the asymmetry of plasma membrane phospholipids is lost, which exposes phosphatidylserine externally. The phagocytosis of apoptotic cells can be inhibited stereospecifically by phosphatidylserine and its structural analogues, but not by other anionic phospholipids, suggesting that phosphatidylserine is specifically recognized. Using phage display, we have cloned a gene that appears to recognize phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. Here we show that this gene, when transfected into B and T lymphocytes, enables them to recognize and engulf apoptotic cells in a phosphatidylserine-specific manner. Flow cytometric analysis using a monoclonal antibody suggested that the protein is expressed on the surface of macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells; this antibody, like phosphatidylserine liposomes, inhibited the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and, in macrophages, induced an anti-inflammatory state. This candidate phosphatidylserine receptor is highly homologous to genes of unknown function in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that phosphatidylserine recognition on apoptotic cells during their removal by phagocytes is highly conserved throughout phylogeny.",,
12023369,"A receptor for the heterodimeric cytokine IL-23 is composed of IL-12Rbeta1 and a novel cytokine receptor subunit, IL-23R.","IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of the IL-12p40 ""soluble receptor"" subunit and a novel cytokine-like subunit related to IL-12p35, termed p19. Human and mouse IL-23 exhibit some activities similar to IL-12, but differ in their capacities to stimulate particular populations of memory T cells. Like IL-12, IL-23 binds to the IL-12R subunit IL-12Rbeta1. However, it does not use IL-12Rbeta2. In this study, we identify a novel member of the hemopoietin receptor family as a subunit of the receptor for IL-23, ""IL-23R."" IL-23R pairs with IL-12Rbeta1 to confer IL-23 responsiveness on cells expressing both subunits. Human IL-23, but not IL-12, exhibits detectable affinity for human IL-23R. Anti-IL-12Rbeta1 and anti-IL-23R Abs block IL-23 responses of an NK cell line and Ba/F3 cells expressing the two receptor chains. IL-23 activates the same Jak-stat signaling molecules as IL-12: Jak2, Tyk2, and stat1, -3, -4, and -5, but stat4 activation is substantially weaker and different DNA-binding stat complexes form in response to IL-23 compared with IL-12. IL-23R associates constitutively with Jak2 and in a ligand-dependent manner with stat3. The ability of cells to respond to IL-23 or IL-12 correlates with expression of IL-23R or IL-12Rbeta2, respectively. The human IL-23R gene is on human chromosome 1 within 150 kb of IL-12Rbeta2.",,
2160731,A receptor for tumor necrosis factor defines an unusual family of cellular and viral proteins.,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha and beta (TNF-alpha and TNF-beta) bind surface receptors on a variety of cell types to mediate a wide range of immunological responses, inflammatory reactions, and anti-tumor effects. A cDNA clone encoding an integral membrane protein of 461 amino acids was isolated from a human lung fibroblast library by direct expression screening with radiolabeled TNF-alpha. The encoded receptor was also able to bind TNF-beta. The predicted cysteine-rich extracellular domain has extensive sequence similarity with five proteins, including nerve growth factor receptor and a transcriptionally active open reading frame from Shope fibroma virus, and thus defines a family of receptors.",,
3470775,A receptor-binding region in human choriogonadotropin/lutropin beta subunit.,"Synthetic fragments have not been widely used thus far to evaluate structure-activity relations in the glycoprotein hormones. We prepared a series of peptides representing the intercysteine ""loop"" sequence (residues 38-57) in human choriogonadotropin (hCG) and lutropin (hLH) beta subunits, anticipating that it might be oriented toward the surface and accessible to receptors. The peptides were characterized chemically and tested for bioactivity by binding to rat ovarian membrane receptor and stimulation of Leydig cell testosterone production. The hCG beta-(38-57) and hLH beta-(38-57) peptides inhibited binding of 125I-labeled hCG half-maximally at 1.51 X 10(-4) and 2.03 X 10(-5) M, respectively, while other peptide hormones and fragments from elsewhere in the beta subunit were inactive. Both peptides stimulated testosterone production, with half-maximal responses at 3.55 X 10(-5) M (hCG) and 2.18 X 10(-5) M (hLH). By radioimmunoassay with an antibody to thyroglobulin-conjugated hCG beta-(38-57) peptide, native hCG and beta subunit were highly reactive, as were the reduced and carboxymethylated subunit and peptide. Helical-wheel projection predicted an amphipathic region in the N-terminal portion of the 38-57 sequence, and circular dichroic measurements showed an increase in ordered structure, especially alpha-helix, when the 38-57 peptides were transferred from an aqueous to a more lipophilic (90% trifluoroethanol) environment. These results indicate that the 38-57 region of beta subunit is exposed on the surface and constitutes a component in the receptor-binding domain for hCG and hLH. A region of amphipathic-helical structure in the 38-57 sequence may promote hormone-receptor interactions in a manner proposed for several other peptide hormones.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1987
10212223,A receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPzeta/RPTPbeta binds a heparin-binding growth factor midkine. Involvement of arginine 78 of midkine in the high affinity binding to PTPzeta.,"Midkine is a 13-kDa heparin-binding growth factor with 45% sequence identity to pleiotrophin. Pleiotrophin has been demonstrated to bind to protein-tyrosine phosphatase zeta (PTPzeta) with high affinity. In this study, we examined the binding of midkine to PTPzeta by solid-phase binding assay. Midkine and pleiotrophin binding to PTPzeta were equally inhibited by soluble pleiotrophin and also by some specific glycosaminoglycans. For both bindings, Scatchard analysis revealed low (3.0 nM) and high (0.58 nM) affinity binding sites. These results suggested that PTPzeta is a common receptor for midkine and pleiotrophin. Midkine is structurally divided into the N- and C-terminal halves, and the latter exhibited full activity for PTPzeta binding and neuronal migration induction. The C-terminal half contains two heparin-binding sites consisting of clusters of basic amino acids, Clusters I and II. A mutation at Arg78 in Cluster I resulted in loss of the high affinity binding and reduced neuronal migration-inducing activity, while mutations at Lys83 and Lys84 in Cluster II showed almost no effect on either activity. Chondroitinase ABC-treated PTPzeta exhibited similar low affinity binding both to the native midkine and midkine mutants at Arg78. These results suggested that Arg78 in midkine plays an essential role in high affinity binding to PTPzeta by interacting with the chondroitin sulfate portion of this receptor.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
1375232,A recombinant ectodomain of the receptor for the stem cell factor (SCF) retains ligand-induced receptor dimerization and antagonizes SCF-stimulated cellular responses.,"The stem cell factor (SCF) is a polypeptide ligand that is essential for the development of germ cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and melanocyte precursors. It binds to a tyrosine kinase membrane receptor that is encoded by the c-kit proto-oncogene. We have constructed an expression vector that directs the synthesis of the entire extracellular ligand-binding domain of the Kit/SCF receptor. When expressed and amplified in Chinese hamster ovary cells, a secreted 90-kDa glycoprotein could be harvested from the growth medium of the cells in a soluble form. This extracellular portion of the Kit/SCF receptor, denoted Kit-X, was recognized by antibodies specific to the SCF receptor; and when injected into animals, it raised antibodies that were reactive with the complete membrane form of the receptor. Direct binding and covalent cross-linking of radiolabeled SCF showed that Kit-X fully retained high affinity ligand binding and also underwent efficient dimerization in the presence of the ligand. The capacity of Kit-X to act as an antagonist of SCF was assayed on cultured cells that overexpress the receptor. Simultaneous addition of SCF and Kit-X to these cells resulted in a stoichiometric inhibition of SCF binding and a consequent decrease in autophosphorylation of the SCF receptor on tyrosine residues. The inhibition extended to later SCF-mediated responses, including the association of the receptor with phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and coupling to the Raf1 protein kinase. These results indicate that the recombinant ectodomain of the Kit-SCF receptor can be used as a specific antagonist of SCF actions and may enable detailed molecular analysis of ligand-receptor interactions.",,
9723705,"A role for CD5 in cognate interactions between T cells and B cells, and identification of a novel ligand for CD5.","CD5 is a glycoprotein expressed at a high level on the surface of mature T lymphocytes. Studies with CD5 mAb and CD5-deficient mice have shown that the CD5 molecules have a significant role in T cell growth response. However, the precise role of CD5 in immune cell interactions is still unclear. The present study provides evidence that CD5 plays a direct role in providing growth signals during the contact-dependent activation and proliferation of splenic B cells. An anti-CD5 mAb inhibited Th1- and Th2-type cell-induced B cell proliferation. CD5-Ig, a chimeric fusion protein, induced proliferation of resting B cells. Flow cytometric analyses using CD5-Ig and mAb to CD72 demonstrated that CD5 bound to a ligand (CD5L), and this binding was not blocked by a variety of anti-CD72 mAb. Also, CD5-Ig did not bind to CD72+-transfected cells. Immunoprecipitation of surface labeled B cell molecules with CD5-Ig showed that CD5L was composed of 77-80 and 38-40 kDa polypeptide chains, distinct from CD72. CD5L was expressed on activated splenic B cells, but not T cells, whereas its expression was constitutive on peritoneal B cells and on B lymphoma cell lines.",,
11257118,A role for syndecan-1 in coupling fascin spike formation by thrombospondin-1.,"An important role of cell matrix adhesion receptors is to mediate transmembrane coupling between extracellular matrix attachment, actin reorganization, and cell spreading. Thrombospondin (TSP)-1 is a modulatory component of matrix expressed during development, immune response, or wound repair. Cell adhesion to TSP-1 involves formation of biochemically distinct matrix contacts based on stable fascin spikes. The cell surface adhesion receptors required have not been identified. We report here that antibody clustering of syndecan-1 proteoglycan specifically transduces organization of cortical actin and fascin bundles in several cell types. Transfection of COS-7 cells with syndecan-1 is sufficient to stimulate cell spreading, fascin spike assembly, and extensive protrusive lateral ruffling on TSP-1 or on syndecan-1 antibody. The underlying molecular mechanism depends on glycosaminoglycan (GAG) modification of the syndecan-1 core protein at residues S45 or S47 for cell membrane spreading and on the VC2 region of the cytoplasmic domain for spreading and fascin spike formation. Expression of the VC2 deletion mutant or GAG-negative syndecan-1 showed that syndecan-1 is necessary in spreading and fascin spike formation by C2C12 cells on TSP-1. These results establish a novel role for syndecan-1 protein in coupling a physiological matrix ligand to formation of a specific matrix contact structure.",,
10516308,A role for the Eph ligand ephrin-A3 in entorhino-hippocampal axon targeting.,"Neurons of layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex constitute the major afferent connection of the hippocampus. The molecular mechanisms that target the entorhinal axons to specific layers in the hippocampus are not known. EphA5, a member of the Eph receptor family, which has been shown to play critical roles in axon guidance, is expressed in the entorhinal cortex, the origin of the perforant pathway. In addition, ligands that interact with EphA5 are expressed in distinct hippocampal regions during development of the entorhino-hippocampal projection. Of these ligands, ephrin-A3 mRNA is localized both in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus and in the pyramidal cell layer of the cornu ammonis, whereas ephrin-A5 mRNA is only expressed in the pyramidal cell layer of the cornu ammonis. In the dentate gyrus, the ligand protein is not present in the termination zone of the entorhinal efferents (the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus) but is concentrated in the inner molecular layer into which entorhinal efferents do not grow. We used outgrowth and stripe assays to test the effects of ephrin-A3 and ephrin-A5 on the outgrowth behavior of entorhinal axons. This functional analysis revealed that entorhinal neurites were repelled by ephrin-A3 but not by ephrin-A5. These observations suggest that ephrin-A3 plays an important role in the layer-specific termination of the perforant pathway and that this ligand may interact with the EphA5 receptor to restrict entorhinal axon terminals in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,1999
11156415,A role for the integrin alphavbeta8 in the negative regulation of epithelial cell growth.,"The control of cell growth is regulated through coordinated responses to growth factors and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Integrins, the major family of cell-ECM receptors, are vital to these coordinated responses. Although much is known of the role of integrins in growth promotion, specific examples of integrin-mediated cell growth inhibition are few. On the basis of our findings that the integrin beta8 subunit is expressed in airway epithelial cells and is absent in lung cancers, we investigated the role and mechanism of the integrin alphavbeta8 in mediating growth inhibition. When introduced into either a lung or colon carcinoma cell line, beta8 inhibited cell growth without inducing apoptosis. Ligation of alphavbeta8 also induced cell rounding, inhibited focal contact formation, and initiated an inhibitory signaling pathway as demonstrated by increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1. The cytoplasmic domain of beta8 was capable of both growth inhibition and causing cell shape changes as shown by the use of a chimeric integrin construct consisting of the beta8-cytoplasmic domain coupled to the beta6-extracellular domain. Finally, when tested in vivo, beta8 potently inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. Together, these results implicate alphavbeta8 as a novel growth-regulatory molecule of epithelial cells.",,
12051776,"A role of EphB4 receptor and its ligand, ephrin-B2, in erythropoiesis.","Erythropoiesis is regulated not only by erythropoietin but also by microenvironments which are composed of transmembrane molecules. We have previously shown that a receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4 is predominantly expressed on human erythroid progenitors in bone marrow. EphB4 is expressed in approximately 45% of hematopoietic progenitor cells, which are CD34-positive and c-Kit-positive in human umbilical cord blood (hUCB). The transmembrane ligand for EphB4 or ephrin-B2 is expressed on bone marrow stromal cells and arterial endothelial cells. When such EphB4-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells were co-cultured with stromal cells which express ephrin-B2, they were immediately detached from stromal cells and differentiated to mature erythroid cells. At that time, expression of EphB4 immediately down-regulated. In contrast, on ephrin-B2 non-expressing stromal cells, they remained EphB4-positive cells and the generated number of mature erythroid cells was less than that on ephrin-B2 expressing stromal cells. Additionally, ephrin-B2 expression on endothelial cells up-regulated under hypoxic condition. Taken together, we propose that one of the molecular cues that regulate erythropoiesis is ephrin-B2 on stromal cells.",,
9892621,"A seven-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor, FPRL1, mediates the chemotactic activity of serum amyloid A for human phagocytic cells.","We have previously reported (Badolato, R., J.M.

Oppenheim, and J.M. Wang. 1995. J. Immunol. 155:1184.) that the acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) is a potent chemoattractant for human leukocytes in vitro and mouse phagocytes in vivo. To identify the signaling mechanisms, we evaluated patterns of cross-desensitization between SAA and other leukocyte chemoattractants. We found that the chemotactic bacterial peptide, N-formyl- methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), was able to specifically attenuate Ca2+ mobilization in human phagocytes induced by SAA, but only at very high concentrations, suggesting that SAA uses a low affinity fMLP receptor. Here we demonstrate that SAA selectively induced Ca2+ mobilization and migration of HEK cells expressing FPRL1, a human seven-transmembrane domain phagocyte receptor with low affinity for fMLP, and high affinity for lipoxin A4. Furthermore, radiolabeled SAA specifically bound to human phagocytes and FPRL1-transfected 293 cells. In contrast, SAA was not a ligand or agonist for FPR, the high affinity fMLP receptor. Thus, SAA is the first chemotactic ligand identified for FPRL1. Our results suggest that FPRL1 mediates phagocyte migration in response to SAA.",,
10930533,A single amino acid of the human and rat neurotensin receptors (subtype 1) determining the pharmacological profile of a species-selective neurotensin agonist.,"The neurotensin (NT) receptor, subtype 1 (NTR1), is a 7-transmembrane-spanning receptor, forming 3 extracellular and 3 intracellular loops. Previously, we showed that the third outer loop (E3) is the binding site for NT and its analogs, several of which bind with higher affinity to rat NTR1 (rNTR1) than to human NTR1 (hNTR1). In particular, NT34 [3,1'-naphthyl-l-Ala(11)]NT(8-13) has greater than 60-fold higher affinity for rNTR1 (46 and 60 pM for transiently- and stably-transfected cells, respectively) than for hNTR1 (2.8 and 5.8 nM for transiently- and stably-transfected cells, respectively) isolated from transfected cell membranes. Previously, our molecular modeling studies of rNTR1 and hNTR1 showed that the binding pocket in the human receptor for NT34 is smaller in volume from the bulky residue Tyr(339) in the pocket center, as compared with the corresponding residue Phe(344) in the rat binding pocket. Therefore, with site-directed mutagenesis, we derived mutant forms of rNTR1(F344Y) and hNTR1(Y339F). Examination of the mutant receptors from membranal preparations of transfected cells in radioligand binding assays and with intact cells in functional assays (phosphatidyl-4,5-bisphosphate turnover) showed that the human-like rat receptor and the rat-like human receptor bound NT34 with a predicted reverse of binding compared with its binding to the wild-type receptors. These results strongly affirm our molecular modeling studies and demonstrate the importance of the study of even minor structural variations in proteins to determine the basis of significantly different drug responses, an area of focus for pharmacological research in the 21st century.",Biochemical pharmacology,2000
7862673,A single arginine residue determines species specificity of the human growth hormone receptor.,"Although growth hormone (GH) receptors (GHRs) in many species bind human (h) GH as well as their own GH, the hGHR only binds primate GH. Arg43 in hGHR interacts with Asp171 of hGH. Nonprimates have a His in the position equivalent to residue 171 of primate GH and a Leu in position 43 of primate GHR. To determine whether Arg43 accounts for the species specificity of the hGHR, point mutations that changed Leu43 to Arg were introduced into the cDNAs encoding the bovine (b) GHR or the rat GH binding protein (GHBP) and these mutants or their wild-type (WT) counterparts were expressed in mouse L cells. Binding of hGH or bGH to transfected cells or to GHBP secreted into the incubation medium was assessed by displacement of 125I-labeled hGH. WT and mutant bGHR bound hGH with similar affinity, but the affinity of the mutant receptors for bGH was reduced 200-fold. Likewise, WT and mutant GHBP bound hGH with equal affinity, but only WT GHBP bound bGH. Cross-linking of 125I-labeled hGH to WT or mutant GHR produced a 141-kDa labeled complex whose appearance was blocked by unlabeled hGH, but bGH blocked cross-linking only to WT receptors. Both hGH and bGH stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 95-kDa protein in cells transfected with WT GHR, but bGH was less effective in cells expressing mutant GHR. We conclude that incompatibility of Arg43 in the hGHR with His171 in nonprimate GH is the major determinant of species specificity.",,
2964083,A single receptor binds both insulin-like growth factor II and mannose-6-phosphate.,"Amino acid sequences deduced from rat complementary DNA clones encoding the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) receptor closely resemble those of the bovine cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (Man-6-P receptorCI), suggesting they are identical structures. It is also shown that IGF-II receptors are adsorbed by immobilized pentamannosyl-6-phosphate and are specifically eluted with Man-6-P. Furthermore, Man-6-P specifically increases by about two times the apparent affinity of the purified rat placental receptor for 125I-labeled IGF-II. These results indicate that the type II IGF receptor contains cooperative, high-affinity binding sites for both IGF-II and Man-6-P-containing proteins.",,
10854442,A small molecule antagonist of chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR3. Potent inhibition of eosinophil function and CCR3-mediated HIV-1 entry.,"We describe a small molecule chemokine receptor antagonist, UCB35625 (the trans-isomer J113863 published by Banyu Pharmaceutical Co., patent WO98/04554), which is a potent, selective inhibitor of CCR1 and CCR3. Nanomolar concentrations of UCB35625 were sufficient to inhibit eosinophil shape change responses to MIP-1alpha, MCP-4, and eotaxin, while greater concentrations could inhibit the chemokine-induced internalization of both CCR1 and CCR3. UCB35625 also inhibited the CCR3-mediated entry of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 primary isolate 89.6 into the glial cell line, NP-2 (IC(50) = 57 nm). Chemotaxis of transfected cells expressing either CCR1 or CCR3 was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of the compound (IC(50) values of CCR1-MIP-1alpha = 9.6 nm, CCR3-eotaxin = 93.7 nm). However, competitive ligand binding assays on the same transfectants revealed that considerably larger concentrations of UCB35625 were needed for effective ligand displacement than were needed for the inhibition of receptor function. Thus, it appears that the compound may interact with a region present in both receptors that inhibits the conformational change necessary to initiate intracellular signaling. By virtue of its potency at the two major eosinophil chemokine receptors, UCB35625 is a prototypic therapy for the treatment of eosinophil-mediated inflammatory disorders, such as asthma and as an inhibitor of CCR3-mediated human immunodeficiency virus-1 entry.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
10318947,"A small-molecule, nonpeptide CCR5 antagonist with highly potent and selective anti-HIV-1 activity.","The beta-chemokine receptor CCR5 is considered to be an attractive target for inhibition of macrophage-tropic (CCR5-using or R5) HIV-1 replication because individuals having a nonfunctional receptor (a homozygous 32-bp deletion in the CCR5 coding region) are apparently normal but resistant to infection with R5 HIV-1. In this study, we found that TAK-779, a nonpeptide compound with a small molecular weight (Mr 531.13), antagonized the binding of RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) to CCR5-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells and blocked CCR5-mediated Ca2+ signaling at nanomolar concentrations. The inhibition of beta-chemokine receptors by TAK-779 appeared to be specific to CCR5 because the compound antagonized CCR2b to a lesser extent but did not affect CCR1, CCR3, or CCR4. Consequently, TAK-779 displayed highly potent and selective inhibition of R5 HIV-1 replication without showing any cytotoxicity to the host cells. The compound inhibited the replication of R5 HIV-1 clinical isolates as well as a laboratory strain at a concentration of 1.6-3.7 nM in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, though it was totally inactive against T-cell line-tropic (CXCR4-using or X4) HIV-1.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1999
24819296,A soluble form of CD80 enhances antitumor immunity by neutralizing programmed death ligand-1 and simultaneously providing costimulation.,"Tumor cells use various methods of immunosuppression to overcome antitumor immunity. One such method is that of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1 or B7-H1), which upon binding its receptor PD-1 on T cells triggers apoptotic death of the activated T cells. Overexpression of the costimulatory molecule CD80 on PD-L1(+) tumor cells, or inclusion of a soluble form of CD80 (CD80-Fc), maintains the activation of PD-1(+)-activated T cells. Using T cells from CD28-deficient mice and antibodies to block CD28 on human T cells, we now report that a soluble form of CD80 mediates this effect by simultaneously neutralizing PD-1-PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression and by providing CD80-CD28 costimulation, and is more effective than antibodies to PD-L1 or PD-1 in maintaining IFNγ production by PD-1(+) activated T cells. Therefore, soluble CD80 may be a more effective therapeutic than these checkpoint antibodies for facilitating the development and maintenance of antitumor immunity because it has the dual functions of preventing PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression and simultaneously delivering the second signal for T-cell activation.",,
24133212,A soluble fragment of the tumor antigen BCL2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG-6) is essential and sufficient for inhibition of NKp30 receptor-dependent cytotoxicity of natural killer cells.,"Immunosurveillance of tumor cells depends on NKp30, a major activating receptor of human natural killer (NK) cells. The human BCL2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG-6, also known as BAT3; 1126 amino acids) is a cellular ligand of NKp30. To date, little is known about the molecular details of this receptor ligand system. Within the current study, we have located the binding site of NKp30 to a sequence stretch of 250 amino acids in the C-terminal region of BAG-6 (BAG-6(686-936)). BAG-6(686-936) forms a noncovalent dimer of 57-59 kDa, which is sufficient for high affinity interaction with NKp30 (KD < 100 nM). As our most important finding, BAG-6(686-936) inhibits NKp30-dependent signaling, interferon-γ release, and degranulation of NK cells in the presence of malignantly transformed target cells. Based on these data, we show for the first time that BAG-6(686-936) comprises a subdomain of BAG-6, which is sufficient for receptor docking and inhibition of NKp30-dependent NK cell cytotoxicity as part of a tumor immune escape mechanism. These molecular insights provide an access point to restore tumor immunosurveillance by NK cells and to increase the efficacy of cellular therapies.",,
10607706,A splice variant of human ephrin-A4 encodes a soluble molecule that is secreted by activated human B lymphocytes.,"Ephrin-A4 is a ligand for the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptor family of tyrosine kinases. We have identified a secreted form of ephrin-A4, denoted ephrin-A4 (s), which is encoded by an alternatively spliced mRNA and is produced by in vivo activated B cells in tonsils. Blood B cells secrete ephrin-A4 (s) upon stimulation via the B-cell antigen receptor. A subpopulation of tonsil cells in the crypts with a dendritic cell phenotype was shown to express EphA2, an Eph receptor tyrosine kinase that was found to be capable of binding an ephrin-A4 immunoglobulin chimeric protein. We conclude that ephrin-A4 (s) may play a role in the interaction between activated B lymphocytes and dendritic cells in human tonsils. (Blood. 2000;95:221-230)",Blood,2000
16930633,A systematic comparison of intracellular cyclic AMP and calcium signalling highlights complexities in human VPAC/PAC receptor pharmacology.,"VPAC/PAC receptor activation classically results in cyclic-AMP production, with limited reports evaluating calcium signalling. These studies systematically characterise intracellular cyclic-AMP ([cAMP](i)) and calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) responses in CHO-cells expressing recombinant human (h) VPAC/PAC receptors (hVPAC(1)R, hVPAC(2)R, hPAC(1)R), using two simple, non-radioactive, HT-amenable assays. The rank order of potency (ROP) of the agonists VIP, PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 was similar in both assays for each individual receptor subtype, although potencies (EC(50)) in the [Ca(2+)](i) assay were approximately 100-fold lower. Importantly, this shift was also evident in SHSY-5Y cells endogenously expressing hPAC(1)R. Furthermore, [Ala(11,22,28)]VIP and maxadilan were selective hVPAC(1)R and hPAC(1)R agonists, respectively, and although R3P65 had no demonstrable hVPAC(2)R selectivity, these compounds exhibited comparable reductions in [Ca(2+)](i) EC(50) values. In contrast, PG97-269 and PG99-465, putatively selective hVPAC(1)R and hVPAC(2)R antagonists, respectively, were marginally less potent in [cAMP](i) studies, whereas M65 was equipotent at hPAC(1)R. Moreover, PG99-465 alone increased [cAMP](i) at all three hVPAC/PAC receptor subtypes, with full hVPAC(1)R and hPAC(1)R agonism. With equivalent agonist ROPs generated in both assays, [Ca(2+)](i) signalling provides an alternative approach to examine hVPAC/PAC receptor pharmacology. However, these studies underscore the paucity of receptor selective compounds, complexities in comparing drug potencies across assays, and the pleiotropic nature of VPAC/PAC-receptor signalling.",,
21725307,A transition zone complex regulates mammalian ciliogenesis and ciliary membrane composition.,"Mutations affecting ciliary components cause ciliopathies. As described here, we investigated Tectonic1 (Tctn1), a regulator of mouse Hedgehog signaling, and found that it is essential for ciliogenesis in some, but not all, tissues. Cell types that do not require Tctn1 for ciliogenesis require it to localize select membrane-associated proteins to the cilium, including Arl13b, AC3, Smoothened and Pkd2. Tctn1 forms a complex with multiple ciliopathy proteins associated with Meckel and Joubert syndromes, including Mks1, Tmem216, Tmem67, Cep290, B9d1, Tctn2 and Cc2d2a. Components of this complex co-localize at the transition zone, a region between the basal body and ciliary axoneme. Like Tctn1, loss of Tctn2, Tmem67 or Cc2d2a causes tissue-specific defects in ciliogenesis and ciliary membrane composition. Consistent with a shared function for complex components, we identified a mutation in TCTN1 that causes Joubert syndrome. Thus, a transition zone complex of Meckel and Joubert syndrome proteins regulates ciliary assembly and trafficking, suggesting that transition zone dysfunction is the cause of these ciliopathies.",Nature genetics,2011
11017100,A transmembrane CXC chemokine is a ligand for HIV-coreceptor Bonzo.,"We describe a protein with the hallmarks of a chemokine, designated CXCL16, that is made by dendritic cells (DCs) in lymphoid organ T cell zones and by cells in the splenic red pulp. CXCL16 contains a transmembrane domain and both membrane-bound and soluble forms are produced. Naïve CD8 T cells, natural killer T cells and a subset of memory CD4 T cells bind CXCL16, and activated T cells migrated chemotactically to the soluble chemokine. By expression cloning, Bonzo (also known as STRL33 and TYMSTR) was identified as a CXCL16 receptor. CXCL16 may function in promoting interactions between DCs and CD8 T cells and in guiding T cell movements in the splenic red pulp. CXCL16 was also found in the thymic medulla and in some nonlymphoid tissues, indicating roles in thymocyte development and effector T cell trafficking.",Nature immunology,2000
11278724,A two-receptor pathway for catabolism of Clara cell secretory protein in the kidney.,"Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) is a transport protein for lipophilic substances in bronchio-alveolar fluid, plasma, and uterine secretion. It acts as a carrier for steroid hormones and polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites. Previously, the existence of receptors for uptake of CCSP.ligand complexes into the renal proximal tubules had been suggested. Using surface plasmon resonance analysis, we demonstrate that CCSP binds to cubilin, a peripheral membrane protein on the surface of proximal tubular cells. Binding to cubilin results in uptake and lysosomal degradation of CCSP in cultured cells. Surprisingly, internalization of CCSP is blocked not only by cubilin antagonists but also by antibodies directed against megalin, an endocytic receptor that does not bind CCSP but associates with cubilin. Consistent with a role of both receptors in renal uptake of CCSP in vivo, patients deficient for cubilin or mice lacking megalin exhibit a defect in tubular uptake of the protein and excrete CCSP into the urine. These findings identify a cellular pathway consisting of a CCSP-binding protein (cubilin) and an endocytic coreceptor (megalin) responsible for tissue-specific uptake of CCSP and associated ligands.",,
11373281,A unique sequence of the laminin alpha 3 G domain binds to heparin and promotes cell adhesion through syndecan-2 and -4.,"Laminin-5, consisting of the alpha 3, beta 3, and gamma 2 chains, is localized in the skin basement membrane and supports the structural stability of the epidermo-dermal linkage and regulates various cellular functions. The alpha chains of laminins have been shown to have various biological activities. In this study, we identified a sequence of the alpha 3 chain C-terminal globular domain (LG1-LG5 modules) required for both heparin binding and cell adhesion using recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides. We found that the LG3 and LG4 modules have activity for heparin binding and that LG4 has activity for cell adhesion. Studies with synthetic peptides delineated the A3G75aR sequence (NSFMALYLSKGR, residues 1412--1423) within LG4 as a major site for both heparin and cell binding. Substitution mutations in LG4 and A3G75aR identified the Lys and Arg of the A3G75aR sequence as critical for these activities. Cell adhesion to LG4 and A3G75aR was inhibited by heparitinase I treatment of cells, suggesting that cell binding to the A3G75aR site was mediated by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. We showed by affinity chromatography that syndecan-2 from fibroblasts bound to LG4. Solid-phase assays confirmed that syndecan-2 interacted with the A3G75aR peptide sequence. Stably transfected 293T cells with expression vectors for syndecan-2 and -4, but not glypican-1, specifically adhered to LG4 and A3G75aR. These results indicate that the A3G75aR sequence within the laminin alpha 3 LG4 module is responsible for cell adhesion and suggest that syndecan-2 and -4 mediate this activity.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
12727981,"Absence of exon 10 of the human luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor impairs LH, but not human chorionic gonadotropin action.","The LH receptor (LHR) mediates the actions of LH and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). In vivo data showed that deletion of exon 10 does not affect hCG action, whereas LH action is impaired. To investigate the role of exon 10 in LH/hCG action in vitro we created stable COS-7 cells expressing the LHR with (wt) or without (-ex10) exon 10. Binding experiments showed that the affinities of LH and hCG to the LHR wt and -ex10 were similar. Stimulation of wt with hCG or LH resulted in increased cAMP. cAMP production was significantly impaired in -ex10 stimulated with LH. This response was not altered by pertussis toxin, excluding that G(i) becomes activated in LHR -ex10. In desensitization experiments, intracellular cAMP of LHR wt and -ex10 declined to approximately 30%. No difference in intracellular cAMP was detected between LHR wt or -ex10 after recovery and restimulation with hCG or LH. These experiments show that impaired cAMP production of LHR -ex10 stimulated with LH is not due to anomalous receptor coupling or desensitization. We conclude that although exon 10 of the LHR plays no role in ligand binding, it is important for receptor activation by LH by a mechanism probably involving extracellular conformational changes.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2003
12851328,Accessory proteins for melanocortin signaling: attractin and mahogunin.,"Switching from eumelanin to pheomelanin synthesis during hair growth is accomplished by transient synthesis of Agouti protein, an inverse agonist for the melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r). The coat color mutations mahogany and mahoganoid prevent hair follicle melanocytes from responding to Agouti protein. The gene mutated in mahogany, which is also known as Attractin (Atrn), encodes a type I transmembrane protein that functions as an accessory receptor for Agouti protein. We have recently determined that the gene mutated in mahoganoid, which is also known as Mahogunin (Mgrn1), encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Like Attractin, Mahogunin is conserved in invertebrate genomes, and its absence causes a pleiotropic phenotype that includes spongiform neurodegeneration.",,
28005151,Activated protein C binds directly to Tie2: possible beneficial effects on endothelial barrier function.,"Activated protein C (APC) is a natural anticoagulant with strong anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and barrier stabilizing properties. These cytoprotective properties of APC are thought to be exerted through its pathway involving the binding of APC to endothelial protein C receptor and cleavage of protease-activated receptors. In this study, we found that APC enhanced endothelial barrier integrity via a novel pathway, by binding directly to and activating Tie2, a transmembrane endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor. Binding assays demonstrated that APC competed with the only known ligands of Tie2, the angiopoietins (Angs). APC bound directly to Tie2 (Kd ~3 nM), with markedly stronger binding affinity than Ang2. After binding, APC rapidly activated Tie2 to enhance endothelial barrier function as shown by Evan's blue dye transfer across confluent cell monolayers and in vivo studies. Blocking Tie2 restricted endothelial barrier integrity. This study highlights a novel mechanism by which APC binds directly to Tie2 to enhance endothelial barrier integrity, which helps to explain APC's protective effects in vascular leakage-related pathologies.",,
11294867,Activation and functional characterization of the mosaic receptor SorLA/LR11.,"We previously isolated and sequenced the approximately 250-kDa type 1 receptor sorLA/LR11, a mosaic protein with elements characterizing the Vps10p domain receptor family as well as the low density lipoprotein receptor family. The N terminus of the Vps10p domain comprises a consensus sequence for cleavage by furin ((50)RRKR(53)) that precedes a truncation found in sorLA isolated from human brain. Here we show that sorLA, like sortilin-1/neurotensin receptor-3, whose lumenal domain consists of a Vps10p domain only, is synthesized as a proreceptor that is cleaved by furin in late Golgi compartments. We show that the truncation conditions the Vps10p domain for propeptide inhibitable binding of neuropeptides and the receptor-associated protein. We further demonstrate that avid binding of the receptor-associated protein, apolipoprotein E, and lipoprotein lipase not inhibited by propeptide occurs to sites located in other lumenal domains. In transfected cells, about 10% of full-length sorLA were expressed on the cell surface capable of mediating endocytosis. However, the major pool of receptors was found in late Golgi compartments, suggesting possible interaction with newly synthesized ligands. The results show that sorLA, following activation by truncation, binds multiple ligands and may mediate both endocytosis and sorting.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
14718570,Activation of EGF receptor kinase by L1-mediated homophilic cell interactions.,"Neural cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are important players during neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth as well as axonal fasciculation and pathfinding. Some of these developmental processes entail the activation of cellular signaling cascades. Pharmacological and genetic evidence indicates that the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of L1-type CAMs is at least in part mediated by the stimulation of neuronal receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), especially FGF and EGF receptors. It has long been suspected that neural CAMs might physically interact with RTKs, but their activation by specific cell adhesion events has not been directly demonstrated. Here we report that gain-of-function conditions of the Drosophila L1-type CAM Neuroglian result in profound sensory axon pathfinding defects in the developing Drosophila wing. This phenotype can be suppressed by decreasing the normal gene dosage of the Drosophila EGF receptor gene. Furthermore, in Drosophila S2 cells, cell adhesion mediated by human L1-CAM results in the specific activation of human EGF tyrosine kinase at cell contact sites and EGF receptors engage in a physical interaction with L1-CAM molecules. Thus L1-type CAMs are able to promote the adhesion-dependent activation of EGF receptor signaling in vitro and in vivo.",,
8386828,Activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors by recombinant human FGF-5.,"We have purified biologically active recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF-5) from Escherichia coli. In the presence of heparin, recombinant FGF-5 is as active as native growth factor, demonstrating that glycosylation does not significantly potentiate FGF-5 activity. FGF-5 can bind and induce autophosphorylation of human FGF receptors (FGFR) 1 and 2. Competition binding studies show that the KD for FGF-5-FGFR-1 and FGF-5-FGFR-2 interactions are both between 0.5 and 1.5 x 10(-9) M.",Oncogene,1993
10962009,"Activation of hepatocyte growth factor and urokinase/plasminogen activator by matriptase, an epithelial membrane serine protease.","Matriptase is an epithelial-derived, integral membrane serine protease. The enzyme was initially isolated from human breast cancer cells and has been implicated in breast cancer invasion and metastasis. In the current study, using active matriptase isolated from human milk, we demonstrate that matriptase is able to cleave various synthetic substrates with arginine or lysine as their P1 sites and prefers small side chain amino acids, such as Ala and Gly, at P2 sites. For the most reactive substrates, N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (N-t-Boc)-gamma-benzyl-Glu-Ala-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) and N-t-Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC, the K(m) values were determined to be 3. 81 and 4.89 microm, respectively. We further demonstrated that matriptase can convert hepatocyte growth factor/scattering factor to its active form, which can induce scatter of Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells and can activate c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation in A549 human lung carcinoma cells. In addition, we noted that matriptase can activate urokinase plasminogen activator but has no affect on plasminogen. These results suggest that matriptase could act as an epithelial, upstream membrane activator to recruit and activate stromal-derived downstream effectors important for extracellular matrix degradation and epithelial migration, two major events of tissue remodeling, cancer invasion, and metastasis.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
9135143,Activation of HER4 by heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor stimulates chemotaxis but not proliferation.,"Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a potent mitogen and chemotactic factor for fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and keratinocytes. It is demonstrated that HB-EGF is not only a ligand for HER1, as previously reported, but for HER4 as well. HB-EGF binds to NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing either HER1 or HER4 alone, but not HER2 or HER3 alone. Binding to HER4 is independent of HER1. The ability of HB-EGF to bind to two different receptors is in contrast to EGF which binds to HER1, but not to HER4, and heregulin-beta1 which binds to HER4, but not to HER1. Besides binding, HB-EGF activates HER4. For example (i) it induces tyrosine phosphorylation of HER4 in cells overexpressing this receptor and of endogenous HER4 in MDA-MB-453 cells and astrocytes; (ii) it induces association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) activity with HER4; and (iii) it is a potent chemotactic factor for cells overexpressing HER4. Chemotaxis is inhibited by wortmannin, a PI3-K inhibitor, suggesting a possible role for PI3-K in mediating HB-EGF-stimulated chemotaxis. On the other hand, HB-EGF is not a mitogen for cells expressing HER4, in contrast to its ability to stimulate both chemotaxis and proliferation in cells expressing HER1. It was concluded that HER4 is a newly described receptor for HB-EGF and that HB-EGF can activate two EGF receptor subtypes, HER1 and HER4, but with different biological responses.",The EMBO journal,1997
9973222,Activation of neurotrophin-3 receptor TrkC induces apoptosis in medulloblastomas.,"Elevated expression of the neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor TrkC by childhood medulloblastomas is associated with favorable clinical outcome. Here, we provide evidence that TrkC is more than simply a passive marker of prognosis. We demonstrate that: (a) medulloblastomas undergo apoptosis in vitro when grown in the presence of NT-3; (b) overexpression of TrkC inhibits the growth of intracerebral xenografts of a medulloblastoma cell line in nude mice; and (c) trkC expression by individual tumor cells is highly correlated with apoptosis within primary medulloblastoma biopsy specimens. TrkC-mediated NT-3 signaling promotes apoptosis by activating multiple parallel signaling pathways and by inducing immediate-early gene expression of both c-jun and c-fos. Considered collectively, these results support the conclusion that the biological actions of TrkC activation affect medulloblastoma outcome by inhibiting tumor growth through the promotion of apoptosis.",Cancer research,1999

A receptor for MICA was detected on most gammadelta T cells, CD8+ alphabeta T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells and was identified as NKG2D. Effector cells from all these subsets could be stimulated by ligation of NKG2D. Engagement of NKG2D activated cytolytic responses of gammadelta T cells and NK cells against transfectants and epithelial tumor cells expressing MICA. These results define an activating immunoreceptor-MHC ligand interaction that may promote antitumor NK and T cell responses.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1999
11809971,Activation of orphan receptors by the hormone relaxin.,"Relaxin is a hormone important for the growth and remodeling of reproductive and other tissues during pregnancy. Although binding sites for relaxin are widely distributed, the nature of its receptor has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that two orphan heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors, LGR7 and LGR8, are capable of mediating the action of relaxin through an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent pathway distinct from that of the structurally related insulin and insulin-like growth factor family ligand. Treatment of antepartum mice with the soluble ligand-binding region of LGR7 caused parturition delay. The wide and divergent distribution of the two relaxin receptors implicates their roles in reproductive, brain, renal, cardiovascular, and other functions.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2002
10487979,"Activation of rat alveolar macrophage-derived latent transforming growth factor beta-1 by plasmin requires interaction with thrombospondin-1 and its cell surface receptor, CD36.","Transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-beta1) is secreted by cells in a latent form (L-TGF-beta1) noncovalently bound to a latency-associated peptide. Activated alveolar macrophages obtained from rat lungs after bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury released increased amounts of active TGF-beta1 as well as plasmin, a protease, and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a trimeric glycoprotein. Previously we had demonstrated that plasmin was critical to the activation of L-TGF- beta1. In the present study we demonstrated that TSP-1 is also important for the activation of L-TGF- beta1 because the activation can be inhibited by anti-TSP-1 monoclonal antibody. Proteins obtained from alveolar macrophage cell lysates immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for TSP-1 were identified on immunoblots as LAP and TGF-beta1, indicating that TSP-1/L-TGF-beta1 complexes are present on alveolar macrophages. However, in the presence of plasmin both latency-associated peptide and TGF-beta1 were decreased in the same cell lysates, indicating that L-TGF-beta1 associated with TSP-1 is released by plasmin. Using immunofluorescence and antibodies to TGF-beta1 and CD36, a receptor for TSP-1, there was colocalization of TGF-beta1 with CD36. Because TSP-1 but not TGF-beta1 is a natural ligand for CD36, these findings suggest that the L-TGF-beta1 in a complex with TSP-1 localizes to the macrophage cell surface when TSP-1 interacts with its receptor, CD36. Furthermore, the association of TSP-1/L-TGF-beta1 complex with CD36 is necessary to the activation of L-TGF-beta1 because antibodies to CD36 prevent the colocalization of TGF-beta1 with CD36 as observed by immunofluorescence and inhibit activation of the L-TGF-beta1 by explanted alveolar macrophages. These findings suggest that activation of L-TGF-beta1 by plasmin occurs at the cell surface of activated alveolar macrophages and requires a TSP-1/CD36 interaction.",,
9262330,Activation of the cloned human kappa opioid receptor by agonists enhances [35S]GTPgammaS binding to membranes: determination of potencies and efficacies of ligands.,"Activation of kappa receptors inhibits adenylate cyclase, enhances K+ conductance and reduces Ca++ conductance via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. We recently cloned a human kappa opioid receptor and stably expressed it in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In this study, the effects of activation of the human kappa receptor by agonists on [35S]GTPgammaS binding to CHO cell membranes were examined. The presence of GDP and Mg++ was essential for the kappa agonist (-)-U50,488H-induced increase in [35S]GTPgammaS binding to be observed and the optimal concentration was 3 microM and 5 mM, respectively. The presence of 100 mM Na+ was necessary to produce the maximal signal-to-background ratio. (-)U50,488H-induced increase in [35S]GTPgammaS binding was time- and tissue concentration-dependent. (-)U50,488H increased [35S]GTPgammaS binding in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 3.1 nM. (+)-U50,488H had no effect, which indicates that this effect is stereospecific. Naloxone (1 microM) or norbinaltorphimine (10 nM) shifted the dose-response curve of (-)-U50,488H to the right by 100-fold. These results indicate that enhancement of [35S]GTPgammaS binding by (-)-U50,488H is a kappa receptor-mediated event. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, but not cholera toxin, abolished the (-)-U50,488H-induced increase in [35S]GTPgammaS binding, which indicates the involvement of Gi and/or Go proteins. [35S]GTPgammaS binding induced by (-)-U50,488H had a Kd value of 0.34 +/- 0.08 nM and a Bmax value of 431 +/- 29 fmol/mg protein. The rank order of potencies of opioid ligands tested in stimulating [35S]GTPgammaS binding was dynorphin A 1-17 > (+/-)-ethylketocyclazocine > beta-funaltrexamine, (-)-U50,488H, tifluadom > nalorphine > pentazocine, nalbuphine > buprenorphine. Dynorphin A 1-17, (+/-)-ethylketocyclazocine, (-)-U50,488H, tifluadom and beta-funaltrexamine were full agonists, but nalorphine and pentazocine were partial agonists producing maximal responses of 68% and 23% of those of full agonists, respectively. Nalbuphine and buprenorphine had low levels of agonist activities. Norbinaltorphimine and naloxone were antagonists devoid of activities. Enhancement of [35S]GTPgammaS binding by kappa agonists provides a simple functional measure for receptor activation and can be used for determination of potencies and efficacies of opioid ligands at the kappa receptor.",,
15620700,Activation of tyrosine kinase of EGFR induces Gbetagamma-dependent GRK-EGFR complex formation.,"This study demonstrated that activation of tyrosine kinase of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) induces its association with G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that EGF stimulation increased GRK2 binding to EGFR complex in HEK293 cells coexpressing EGFR and GRK2. The EGF-induced GRK2-EGFR complex formation was greatly reduced by perturbation of EGFR and Src tyrosine kinase activity. Furthermore, studies with GRK2 mutants showed that neither catalytic activity nor the N-terminal domain of GRK2 was required for EGF-induced GRK2-EGFR complex formation. However, overexpression of Gbetagamma scavengers blocked EGF-induced formation of GRK2-EGFR complex.",,
15196700,Activin isoforms signal through type I receptor serine/threonine kinase ALK7.,"Activins play a fundamental role in cell differentiation and development. Activin A signaling is mediated through a combination of activin type II receptors (ActRIIs) and the activin type IB receptor, ALK4. Signaling receptors of other activin isoforms remain to be elucidated. Here, we found that activin AB and activin B are ligands for ALK7. ALK7 is an orphan receptor serine/threonine kinase expressed in neuroendocrine tissues including pancreatic islets. The combination of ActRIIA and ALK7, preferred by activin AB and activin B but not by activin A, is responsible for activin-mediated secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cell line, MIN6. In contrast, all activins activate a combination of ActRIIA and ALK4 with various levels of potency. Thus, variation in activin signaling through type I receptors is dependent upon homo- and heterodimeric assembly of activin isoforms. Thus, the differential combination of receptor heterodimers mediates variation in activin isoform signaling.",Molecular and cellular endocrinology,2004
10716993,Activin receptor-like kinase 1 modulates transforming growth factor-beta 1 signaling in the regulation of angiogenesis.,"The activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is a type I receptor for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family proteins. Expression of ALK1 in blood vessels and mutations of the ALK1 gene in human type II hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients suggest that ALK1 may have an important role during vascular development. To define the function of ALK1 during development, we inactivated the ALK1 gene in mice by gene targeting. The ALK1 homozygous embryos die at midgestation, exhibiting severe vascular abnormalities characterized by excessive fusion of capillary plexes into cavernous vessels and hyperdilation of large vessels. These vascular defects are associated with enhanced expression of angiogenic factors and proteases and are characterized by deficient differentiation and recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells. The blood vessel defects in ALK1-deficient mice are reminiscent of mice lacking TGF-beta1, TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaR-II), or endoglin, suggesting that ALK1 may mediate TGF-beta1 signal in endothelial cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that ALK1 in endothelial cells binds to TGF-beta1 and TbetaR-II. Furthermore, the ALK1 signaling pathway can inhibit TGF-beta1-dependent transcriptional activation mediated by the known TGF-beta1 type I receptor, ALK5. Taken together, our results suggest that the balance between the ALK1 and ALK5 signaling pathways in endothelial cells plays a crucial role in determining vascular endothelial properties during angiogenesis.",,
8397373,Activin receptor-like kinases: a novel subclass of cell-surface receptors with predicted serine/threonine kinase activity.,"Human cDNA clones encoding four novel putative transmembrane protein serine/threonine kinases, denoted activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) -1, -2, -3 and -4, were obtained using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategy. The PCR primers were designed based upon the sequence similarity between the activin receptor type II and Daf-1. The cDNA clones for ALK-1, -2 and -3 encode complete proteins of 503, 509 and 532 amino acids respectively. The ALK-4 cDNA is incomplete and the predicted protein of 383 amino acids has a truncated extracellular domain. The ALKs share similar domain structures, comprising predicted signal sequences at the N-terminals, followed by hydrophilic cysteine-rich ligand-binding domains, single hydrophobic transmembrane regions and C-terminal intracellular portions that consist almost entirely of putative serine/threonine kinase domains. The ALKs have approximately 40% sequence identity to activin receptors type II and IIB, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) type II receptor and Daf-1 in the kinase domains. However, the sequence identities are higher (60-79%) between ALK-1, -2, -3 and -4, suggesting that they form a subfamily among the putative receptor serine/threonine kinases. The extracellular domains of ALKs show only little sequence identity to other putative receptor serine/threonine kinases, but the cysteine residues are conserved. Their structural properties suggest that ALK-1 to -4 are receptors that may bind ligands that are members of the TGF-beta superfamily. The expression of mRNA in human tissues varied for the different ALKs; ALK-2 and ALK-4 showed ubiquitous tissue expression patterns, whereas the distribution of ALK-1 and ALK-3 varied strongly between different tissues with more restricted expression patterns. These results suggest that each ALK may have different in vivo functions.",Oncogene,1993
12414726,Activin type IIA and IIB receptors mediate Gdf11 signaling in axial vertebral patterning.,"Vertebral bodies are segmented along the anteroposterior (AP) body axis, and the segmental identity of the vertebrae is determined by the unique expression pattern of multiple Hox genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family protein, Gdf11 (growth and differentiation factor 11), and the activin type II receptor, ActRIIB, are involved in controlling the spatiotemporal expression of multiple Hox genes along the AP axis, and that the disruption of each of these genes causes anterior transformation of the vertebrae. Skeletal defects are more severe in Gdf11-null mice than in ActRIIB-null mice, however, leaving it uncertain whether Gdf11 signals via ActRIIB. Here we demonstrate using genetic and biochemical studies that ActRIIB and its subfamily receptor, ActRIIA, cooperatively mediate the Gdf11 signal in patterning the axial vertebrae, and that Gdf11 binds to both ActRIIA and ActRIIB, and induces phosphorylation of Smad2. In addition, we also show that these two receptors can functionally compensate for one another to mediate signaling of another TGF-beta ligand, nodal, during left-right patterning and the development of anterior head structure.",,
10749942,"ADAM 23/MDC3, a human disintegrin that promotes cell adhesion via interaction with the alphavbeta3 integrin through an RGD-independent mechanism.","ADAM 23 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain)/MDC3 (metalloprotease, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich domain) is a member of the disintegrin family of proteins expressed in fetal and adult brain. In this work we show that the disintegrin-like domain of ADAM 23 produced in Escherichia coli and immobilized on culture dishes promotes attachment of different human cells of neural origin, such as neuroblastoma cells (NB100 and SH-S(y)5(y)) or astrocytoma cells (U373 and U87 MG). Analysis of ADAM 23 binding to integrins revealed a specific interaction with alphavbeta3, mediated by a short amino acid sequence present in its putative disintegrin loop. This sequence lacks any RGD motif, which is a common structural determinant supporting alphavbeta3-mediated interactions of diverse proteins, including other disintegrins. alphavbeta3 also supported adhesion of HeLa cells transfected with a full-length cDNA for ADAM 23, extending the results obtained with the recombinant protein containing the disintegrin domain of ADAM 23. On the basis of these results, we propose that ADAM 23, through its disintegrin-like domain, may function as an adhesion molecule involved in alphavbeta3-mediated cell interactions occurring in normal and pathological processes, including progression of malignant tumors from neural origin.",,
15504110,ADAM disintegrin-like domain recognition by the lymphocyte integrins alpha4beta1 and alpha4beta7.,"The ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family of proteins possess both proteolytic and adhesive domains. We have established previously that the disintegrin domain of ADAM28, an ADAM expressed by human lymphocytes, is recognized by the integrin alpha4beta1. The present study characterizes the integrin binding properties of the disintegrin-like domains of human ADAM7, ADAM28 and ADAM33 with the integrins alpha4beta1, alpha4beta7 and alpha9beta1. Cell-adhesion assays demonstrated that, similar to ADAM28, the ADAM7 disintegrin domain supported alpha4beta1-dependent Jurkat cell adhesion, whereas the ADAM33 disintegrin domain did not. The lymphocyte integrin alpha4beta7 was also found to recognize both disintegrin domains of ADAM7 and ADAM28, but not of ADAM33. This is the first demonstration that mammalian disintegrins are capable of interacting with alpha4beta7. All three disintegrin domains supported alpha9beta1-dependent cell adhesion. Recognition by both alpha4beta1 and alpha4beta7 of ADAM7 and ADAM28 was activation-dependent, requiring either the presence of Mn2+ or an activating monoclonal antibody for cell attachment. Charge-to-alanine mutagenesis experiments revealed that the same residues within an individual ADAM disintegrin domain function in recognizing multiple integrins. However, the residues within a specific region of each ADAM disintegrin-like domain required for integrin binding were distinct. These results establish that ADAM7 and ADAM28 are recognized by the leucocyte integrins alpha4beta1, alpha4beta7 and alpha9beta1. ADAM33 exclusively supported only alpha9beta1-dependent adhesion.",,
16239146,Adam meets Eph: an ADAM substrate recognition module acts as a molecular switch for ephrin cleavage in trans.,"The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands are mediators of cell-cell communication. Cleavage of ephrin-A2 by the ADAM10 membrane metalloprotease enables contact repulsion between Eph- and ephrin-expressing cells. How ADAM10 interacts with ephrins in a regulated manner to cleave only Eph bound ephrin molecules remains unclear. The structure of ADAM10 disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains and the functional studies presented here define an essential substrate-recognition module for functional interaction of ADAM10 with the ephrin-A5/EphA3 complex. While ADAM10 constitutively associates with EphA3, the formation of a functional EphA3/ephrin-A5 complex creates a new molecular recognition motif for the ADAM10 cysteine-rich domain that positions the proteinase domain for effective ephrin-A5 cleavage. Surprisingly, the cleavage occurs in trans, with ADAM10 and its substrate being on the membranes of opposing cells. Our data suggest a simple mechanism for regulating ADAM10-mediated ephrin proteolysis, which ensures that only Eph bound ephrins are recognized and cleaved.",,
12509413,ADAM12/syndecan-4 signaling promotes beta 1 integrin-dependent cell spreading through protein kinase Calpha and RhoA.,"The ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) comprise a large family of multidomain proteins with cell-binding and metalloprotease activities. The ADAM12 cysteine-rich domain (rADAM12-cys) supports cell attachment using syndecan-4 as a primary cell surface receptor that subsequently triggers beta(1) integrin-dependent cell spreading, stress fiber assembly, and focal adhesion formation. This process contrasts with cell adhesion on fibronectin, which is integrin-initiated but syndecan-4-dependent. In the present study, we investigated ADAM12/syndecan-4 signaling leading to cell spreading and stress fiber formation. We demonstrate that syndecan-4, when present in significant amounts, promotes beta(1) integrin-dependent cell spreading and stress fiber formation in response to rADAM12-cys. A mutant form of syndecan-4 deficient in protein kinase C (PKC)alpha activation or a different member of the syndecan family, syndecan-2, was unable to promote cell spreading. GF109203X and Gö6976, inhibitors of PKC, completely inhibited ADAM12/syndecan-4-induced cell spreading. Expression of syndecan-4, but not syn4DeltaI, resulted in the accumulation of activated beta(1) integrins at the cell periphery in Chinese hamster ovary beta1 cells as revealed by 12G10 staining. Further, expression of myristoylated, constitutively active PKCalpha resulted in beta(1) integrin-dependent cell spreading, but additional activation of RhoA was required to induce stress fiber formation. In summary, these data provide novel insights into syndecan-4 signaling. Syndecan-4 can promote cell spreading in a beta(1) integrin-dependent fashion through PKCalpha and RhoA, and PKCalpha and RhoA likely function in separate pathways.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
21170088,ADAM17 (TACE) regulates TGFβ signaling through the cleavage of vasorin.,"The activity of a variety of extracellular signaling factors is tightly regulated by proteins containing A Disintegrin And a Metalloprotease domain (ADAM) metalloproteases through limited proteolysis. Thus, the identification of ADAM substrates may unveil novel components and mechanisms of cell signaling pathways. We report the identification of the transmembrane protein vasorin (VASN), a transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) trap, as a substrate of ADAM17. The metalloprotease efficiently generates a soluble fragment encompassing the extracellular domain of VASN. Despite the importance of TGFβ in normal development and tumor progression, the regulation of VASN is completely unknown. Here, we show that only the soluble form of VASN inhibits TGFβ and that the secretion of VASN is tightly controlled by ADAM17. Hence, inhibition of ADAM17 leads to the upregulation of TGFβ signaling. Adding a new level of complexity to the function of ADAM17, we finally show that, through the cleavage of VASN, the metalloprotease controls TGFβ-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.",Oncogene,2011
21060781,ADAM2 interactions with mouse eggs and cell lines expressing α4/α9 (ITGA4/ITGA9) integrins: implications for integrin-based adhesion and fertilization.,"Integrins are heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules, with 18 α (ITGA) and eight β (ITGB) subunits forming 24 heterodimers classified into five families. Certain integrins, especially the α(4)/α(9) (ITGA4/ITGA9) family, interact with members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family. ADAM2 is among the better characterized and also of interest because of its role in sperm function. Having shown that ITGA9 on mouse eggs participates in mouse sperm-egg interactions, we sought to characterize ITGA4/ITGA9-ADAM2 interactions.",,
20220021,Adam22 is a major neuronal receptor for Lgi4-mediated Schwann cell signaling.,"The segregation and myelination of axons in the developing PNS, results from a complex series of cellular and molecular interactions between Schwann cells and axons. Previously we identified the Lgi4 gene (leucine-rich glioma-inactivated4) as an important regulator of myelination in the PNS, and its dysfunction results in arthrogryposis as observed in claw paw mice. Lgi4 is a secreted protein and a member of a small family of proteins that are predominantly expressed in the nervous system. Their mechanism of action is unknown but may involve binding to members of the Adam (A disintegrin and metalloprotease) family of transmembrane proteins, in particular Adam22. We found that Lgi4 and Adam22 are both expressed in Schwann cells as well as in sensory neurons and that Lgi4 binds directly to Adam22 without a requirement for additional membrane associated factors. To determine whether Lgi4-Adam22 function involves a paracrine and/or an autocrine mechanism of action we performed heterotypic Schwann cell sensory neuron cultures and cell type-specific ablation of Lgi4 and Adam22 in mice. We show that Schwann cells are the principal cellular source of Lgi4 in the developing nerve and that Adam22 is required on axons. Our results thus reveal a novel paracrine signaling axis in peripheral nerve myelination in which Schwann cell secreted Lgi4 functions through binding of axonal Adam22 to drive the differentiation of Schwann cells.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2010
7969453,Adhesion between epithelial cells and T lymphocytes mediated by E-cadherin and the alpha E beta 7 integrin.,"In contrast to sessile cell types, lymphocytes migrate through the vasculature to become diffusely distributed in tissues or organized in lymphoid structures. A complex array of adhesion molecules including selectins, integrins and their counter-receptors mediate lymphocyte homing and migration into tissues and may be constitutively expressed or induced. However, the molecules that mediate the tissue-specific retention of lymphocytes within the parenchyma have not been identified. Along the epithelium at the basolateral surface of enterocytes, intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes are found. These T cells of the mucosal immune system serve as a model for the tissue-specific compartmentalization of lymphocytes. We investigated whether the localization of these intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes could be mediated by specific interactions between adhesion molecules expressed selectively on this subpopulation of T cells and tissue-restricted adhesion molecules on epithelial cells. Here we show that heterotypic adhesive interactions between epithelial cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes in vitro are mediated by E-cadherin and the alpha E beta 7 integrin.",,
9686320,Adhesion of cultured human kidney mesangial cells to native entactin: role of integrin receptors.,"Entactin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein which binds to laminin and is found in most renal basement membranes and in the glomerular mesangial matrix. In the present study, we have characterized specific integrin receptors on cultured human mesangial cells (CHMC) responsible for adhesion to native entactin. The integrin receptors alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 3 beta 1, alpha 5 beta 1, alpha v beta 3, alpha v beta 5, and alpha 6 complexed with either beta 1 or beta 4 could be immune precipitated from detergent extracts of metabolically labeled CHMC. Adhesion assays with inhibitory anti integrin monoclonal antibodies (mab) demonstrated that CHMC use both alpha v beta 3 and a beta 1-containing integrin to bind surfaces coated with native entactin. Optimal binding of CHMC to native entactin required the participation of cations. Using wild type and mutant recombinant entactin fragments, the binding site for the alpha v beta 3 receptor was localized to the RGD sequence on the rod or E domain of entactin. CHMC adhesion to mutant full length recombinant entactin ligands lacking the E domain RGD sequence confirmed the presence of ligand binding site(s) for beta 1 integrin receptor(s). Differences in CHMC binding characteristics to recombinant and full length entactin compared to native bovine basement membrane entactin were observed. This suggests that tertiary molecular structure may contribute to entactin ligand binding properties. Primary amino acid residue sequences and tertiary structure of entactin may play roles in forming functional cell attachment sites in native basement membrane entactin.",,
15383453,Adhesion of human T cells to antigen-presenting cells through SIRPbeta2-CD47 interaction costimulates T-cell proliferation.,"Signal-regulatory proteins (SIRPs) are transmembrane glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that are expressed in the immune and central nervous systems. SIRPalpha binds CD47 and inhibits the function of macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes, whereas SIRPbeta1 is an orphan receptor that activates the same cell types. A recently identified third member of the SIRP family, SIRPbeta2, is as yet uncharacterized in terms of expression, specificity, and function. Here, we show that SIRPbeta2 is expressed on T cells and activated natural killer (NK) cells and, like SIRPalpha, binds CD47, mediating cell-cell adhesion. Consequently, engagement of SIRPbeta2 on T cells by CD47 on antigen-presenting cells results in enhanced antigen-specific T-cell proliferation.",,
9446626,Adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to the immediate-early gene product Cyr61 is mediated through integrin alphavbeta3.,"Cyr61 is a member of a family of growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene products thought to act cooperatively with the activities of growth factors. Upon synthesis, Cyr61 is secreted and is predominantly incorporated into the extracellular matrix. Recently, we demonstrated that Cyr61 promotes cell adhesion and migration and augments growth factor-induced DNA synthesis (Kireeva, M. L., Mo, F.-E., Yang, G. P., and Lau, L. F. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 16, 1326-1334). In the present study, we investigated possible candidate receptor(s) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) mediating adhesion to Cyr61. Under both serum-containing and serum-free conditions, adhesion of HUVECs to Cyr61 was dose-dependent, saturable, and abolished by affinity-purified anti-Cyr61 antibodies. Cell adhesion to Cyr61 was divalent cation-dependent and specifically inhibited by the peptide RGDS and LM609, a monoclonal antibody against integrin alphavbeta3. Furthermore, purified alphavbeta3 bound directly to an affinity matrix of Cyr61-coupled Sepharose 4B, and this interaction was specifically blocked by anti-Cyr61 antibodies. Additionally, in a solid phase binding assay, soluble Cyr61 bound to immobilized alphavbeta3 in a dose-dependent manner, and half-saturation binding occurred at approximately 5 nM Cyr61. As expected, the interaction of Cyr61 with immobilized alphavbeta3 was blocked by RGDS and LM609. In sum, these results identified Cyr61 as a novel ligand for alphavbeta3 and indicate that the adhesion of HUVECs to Cyr61 is mediated through interaction with this integrin. The possibility that integrin alphavbeta3 functions as a signaling receptor for Cyr61 accounts for most if not all activities that can be ascribed to Cyr61 to date and suggests a mechanism of action discussed herein.",,
34403808,Adiponectin's globular domain inhibits T cell activation by interacting with LAIR-1.,"Adiponectin (APN) is the most abundant adipokine in human plasma, and has insulin-sensitizing effect. Recent studies have reported that APN plays both anti- and pro-inflammatory roles under different circumstances. However, there is a lack of convincing evidence that decipher APN's anti-inflammatory role through the known receptors and their downstream signaling pathways. In this study, we evaluated a new molecular mechanism underlying APN's anti-inflammatory roles. Our results revealed that the globular domain of adiponectin (gAdp) interacted with the inhibitory leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1). In vitro experiments showed that gAdp inhibited activation of the T cells via the LAIR-1, through a process that also involved downstream SHP-2. These findings indicate that LAIR-1 is a novel APN receptor, affirming APN's anti-inflammatory effect. In summary, we have identified a novel mechanism of peripheral immunoregulatory processes that provides baseline information for further studies on gAdp's role and its contribution to inflammation.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2021
12799371,ADP-ribosylation factor-dependent phospholipase D activation by the M3 muscarinic receptor.,"G protein-coupled receptors can potentially activate phospholipase D (PLD) by a number of routes. We show here that the native M3 muscarinic receptor in 1321N1 cells and an epitope-tagged M3 receptor expressed in COS7 cells substantially utilize an ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-dependent route of PLD activation. This pathway is activated at the plasma membrane but appears to be largely independent of G, phospholipase C, Ca2+ q/11, protein kinase C, tyrosine kinases, and phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase. We report instead that it involves physical association of ARF with the M3 receptor as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and by in vitro interaction with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the receptor's third intracellular loop domain. Experiments with mutant constructs of ARF1/6 and PLD1/2 indicate that the M3 receptor displays a major ARF1-dependent route of PLD1 activation with an additional ARF6-dependent pathway to PLD1 or PLD2. Examples of other G protein-coupled receptors assessed in comparison display alternative pathways of protein kinase C- or ARF6-dependent activation of PLD2.",,
12519790,ADP-ribosylation factor-dependent phospholipase D2 activation is required for agonist-induced mu-opioid receptor endocytosis.,"Agonist exposure of many G protein-coupled receptors induces a rapid receptor phosphorylation and uncoupling from G proteins. Resensitization of these desensitized receptors requires endocytosis and subsequent dephosphorylation. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, the rat mu-opioid receptor (MOR1, also termed MOP) was found to be associated with phospholipase D2 (PLD2), a phospholipid-specific phosphodiesterase located in the plasma membrane, which has been implicated in the formation of endocytotic vesicles. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells coexpressing MOR1 and PLD2 confirmed that MOR1 constitutively interacts with PLD2. Treatment with the mu receptor agonist DAMGO ([d-Ala(2), Me Phe(4), Glyol(5)]enkephalin) led to an increase in PLD2 activity, whereas morphine, which does not induce MOR1 receptor internalization, failed to induce PLD2 activation. The DAMGO-mediated PLD2 activation was inhibited by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) but not by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C indicating that opioid receptor-mediated activation of PLD2 is ARF- but not PKC-dependent. Furthermore, heterologous stimulation of PLD2 by phorbol ester led to an accelerated internalization of the mu-opioid receptor after both DAMGO and morphine exposure. Conversely the inhibition of PLD2-mediated phosphatidic acid formation by 1-butanol or overexpression of a negative mutant of PLD2 prevented agonist-mediated endocytosis of MOR1. Together, these data suggest that PLD2 play a key role in the regulation of agonist-induced endocytosis of the mu-opioid receptor.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
9414473,Advances in understanding gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor structure and ligand interactions.,"Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the central regulator of the reproductive system and its analogues are used widely in the treatment of diverse diseases. The GnRH receptor is a member of the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which have seven transmembrane domains. Knowledge of these receptors has assisted the development of molecular models of the GnRH receptor that allow prediction of its three-dimensional configuration and the way GnRH binds and activates its receptor. Comparison with other GPCRs led to the discovery that Lys121, in the third transmembrane domain, has a role in agonist binding. The history of GnRH structure-activity studies has allowed the identification of an acidic residue in the third extracellular loop of the receptor that is required for binding of mammalian GnRH, while synthetic GnRH analogues have showed that Asn102, in the second extracellular loop, may interact with the carboxy-terminus of GnRH. These residues can now be incorporated into the receptor models that are being used to design orally active non-peptide GnRH analogues for contraception and treatment of a variety of reproductive disorders.",Reviews of reproduction,1997
11404363,"Affinity, kinetics, and thermodynamics of E-selectin binding to E-selectin ligand-1.","E-selectin is an endothelial adhesion molecule, which mediates the tethering and rolling of leukocytes on vascular endothelium. It recognizes the glycoprotein E-selectin ligand-1 (ESL-1) as a major binding partner on mouse myeloid cells. Using surface plasmon resonance, we measured the kinetics and affinity of binding of monomeric E-selectin to ESL-1 isolated from mouse bone marrow cells. E-selectin bound to ESL-1 with a fast dissociation rate constant of 4.6 s(-1) and a calculated association rate constant of 7.4 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1). We determined a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 62 microm, which resembles the affinity of L-selectin binding to glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1. The affinity of the E-selectin-ESL-1 interaction did not change significantly when the temperature was varied from 5 degrees C to 37 degrees C, indicating that the enthalpic contribution to the binding is small at physiological temperatures, and that, in contrast to typical protein-carbohydrate interactions, binding is driven primarily by favorable entropic changes. Interestingly, surface plasmon resonance experiments with recombinant ESL-1 from alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferase IV-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells showed a very similar K(d) of 66 microm, suggesting that this fucosyltransferase is sufficient to produce fully functional recombinant ESL-1. Following the recent description of the affinity and kinetics of the selectin-ligand pairs L-selectin-glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 and P-selectin-P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, this is the first determination of the parameters of E-selectin binding to one of its naturally occurring ligands.",,
11723247,"Agonism, inverse agonism, and neutral antagonism at the constitutively active human neurotensin receptor 2.","Two G protein-coupled neurotensin (NT) receptors, termed NTR1 and NTR2, have been identified so far. In contrast to the NTR1, which has been extensively studied, little is known about the pharmacological and biological properties of the NTR2. In the course of characterizing NT analogs that exhibited binding selectivity for the NTR2, we discovered that this receptor constitutively activated inositol phosphate (IP) production. Here, we report on the constitutive activity of the human NTR2 (hNTR2) transfected in COS cells and on compounds that exhibit agonism, inverse agonism, and neutral antagonism at this receptor. IP levels increased linearly with time, whereas they remained constant in mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, IP production was proportional to the amount of hNTR2 present at the cell membrane. SR 48692, a nonpeptide antagonist of the NTR1, stimulated IP production, whereas levocabastine, a nonpeptide histamine H1 antagonist that binds the NTR2 but not the NTR1, behaved as a weak partial inverse agonist. NT analogs modified at position 11 of the NT molecule, in particular by the introduction of bulky aromatic D amino acids, exhibited binding selectivity at the hNTR2 and also behaved as partial inverse agonists, reversing constitutive IP production up to 50%. Finally, NT barely affected constitutive IP production but antagonized the effects of both agonist and inverse agonist compounds, thus behaving as a neutral antagonist. The unique pharmacological profile of the hNTR2 is discussed in the light of its sequence similarity with the NTR1 and the known binding site topology of NT and SR 48692 in the NTR1.",Molecular pharmacology,2001
11325787,Agonist and antagonist activities on human NPFF(2) receptors of the NPY ligands GR231118 and BIBP3226.,"Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) is a part of a neurotransmitter system acting as a modulator of endogenous opioid functions. At this time, no non-peptide or peptide NPFF-antagonists have been discovered. Here, we demonstrate that Neuropeptide Y (NPY) ligands, in fact possess significant ability to interact with the human NPFF(2) receptors. NPY Y(1) antagonist BIBP3226 and mixed Y(1) antagonist/Y(4) agonist GR231118 are able to displace with low affinity, 50 -- 100 nM, the specific binding on NPFF receptors expressed in CHO cells as well as in rat dorsal spinal cord, an affinity however superior to those determined against Y(2), Y(4) or Y(5) receptors. Furthermore, BIBP3226 which is unable to inhibit the forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production mediated by NPFF(2) receptors, antagonizes the effect of NPFF, revealing the first antagonist of NPFF receptors. These properties of NPY ligands on Neuropeptide FF receptors must be considered when evaluating pharmacological activities of these drugs.",British journal of pharmacology,2001
21362456,Agonist ligand discrimination by the two orexin receptors depends on the expression system.,"Despite the recent successes in producing orexin receptor subtype-selective antagonists, these are not commonly available, and therefore, agonist ligands are regularly used to ascribe cell and tissue responses to OX(1) or OX(2) receptors. In the current study, we have compared the native ""subtype-selective"" agonist, orexin-B, and its reputedly enhanced synthetic variant, Ala(11), d-Leu(15)-orexin-B, in two different recombinant cell lines. Ca2+ elevation was used as readout, and the two ""selective"" ligands were compared to the subtype-non-selective orexin-A, as is customary with these ligands. In transiently transfected HEK-293 cells, orexin-B showed 9-fold selectivity for the OX(2) receptor and Ala(11), d-Leu(15)-orexin-B 23-fold selectivity, when the potency ratios of ligands were compared between OX(1) and OX(2). In stable CHO-K1 cells, the corresponding values were only 2.6- and 14-fold, respectively. In addition to being low, the selectivity of the ligands was also variable, as indicated by the comparison of the two cell lines. For instance, the relative potency of Ala(11), d-Leu(15)-orexin-B at OX(2) in CHO cells was only 2.3-fold higher than its relative potency at OX(1) in HEK-293 cells; this indicates that Ala(11), d-Leu(15)-orexin-B does not show high enough selectivity for OX(2) to be useful for determination of receptor subtype expression. Comparison of the potencies of orexin-A and -B with respect to a number of published responses in OX(1)-expressing CHO cells, demonstrates that these show great variation: i.e., orexin-A is 1.6-18-fold more potent than orexin-B, depending on the response assessed. These data together suggest that orexin receptor ligands show signal trafficking, which makes agonist-based pharmacology unreliable.",Neuroscience letters,2011
12068084,Agonists activate Gi1 alpha or Gi2 alpha fused to the human mu opioid receptor differently.,"As preferential coupling of opioid receptor to various inhibitory Galpha subunits is still under debate, we have investigated the selectivity of the human mu opioid receptor fused to a pertussis toxin insensitive C351I Gi1 alpha or C352I Gi2 alpha in stably transfected HEK 293 cells. Overall agonist binding affinities were increased for both fusion constructs when compared to the wild type receptor. [35 S]GTPgammaS binding was performed on pertussis toxin treated cells to monitor coupling efficiency of the fusion constructs. Upon agonist addition hMOR-C351I Gi1 a exhibited an activation profile similar to the non-fused receptor while hMOR-C352I Gi2 alpha was poorly activated. Interestingly no correlation could be drawn between agonist binding affinity and efficacy. Upon agonist addition, forskolin-stimulated cAMP production, as measured using a reporter gene assay, was inhibited by signals transduced via the fused Gi1 alpha and Gi2 alpha mainly. In contrast both fusion constructs were able to initiate ERK-MAPK phosphorylation via coupling to endogenous G proteins only. In conclusion our data indicate that hMOR couples more efficiently to Gi1 alpha than Gi2 alpha and that the coupling efficacy is clearly agonist-dependent.",Journal of neurochemistry,2002

Agrin is a nerve-derived factor that can induced molecular reorganizations at the motor endplate, but the mechanism of action of agrin remains poorly understood. MuSK is a receptor tyrosine kinase localized to the motor endplate, seemingly well positioned to receive a key nerve-derived signal. Mice lacking either agrin or MuSK have recently been generated and exhibit similarly profound defects in their neuromuscular junctions. Here we demonstrate that agrin acts via a receptor complex that includes MuSK as well as a myotube-specific accessory component.",Cell,1996

28977600,ALK2/ALK3-BMPR2/ACVR2A Mediate BMP2-Induced Downregulation of Pentraxin 3 Expression in Human Granulosa-Lutein Cells.,"Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) belongs to the transforming growth factor-β superfamily and plays a critical role in regulating ovarian follicle function. Currently, the role of BMP2 during cumulus expansion remains to be determined. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of BMP2 on the regulation of pentraxin 3 (PTX3) expression (the major component of cumulus expansion) and the underlying mechanisms in human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells. Both primary and immortalized hGL cells were used as research models. Our results showed that treatment with BMP2 significantly suppressed the basal and luteinizing hormone-induced upregulation of PTX3. In addition, BMP2 stimulated the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8, and this effect was abolished by the addition of BMP type I receptor inhibitors, dorsomorphin homolog 1, and dorsomorphin but not SB431542. Moreover, the knockdown of activin receptorlike kinase 2/3 or BMP receptor type II/activin receptor type IIB receptors completely reversed the BMP2-induced phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 and restored PTX3 expression. Similarly, the knockdown of SMAD4 completely reversed the suppressive effect of BMP2 on the expression of PTX3. These results improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of BMP2 signaling. Our findings suggest that BMP2 may be involved in the regulation of cumulus expansion during the periovulatory stage.",Endocrinology,2017
20519495,"All mammalian Hedgehog proteins interact with cell adhesion molecule, down-regulated by oncogenes (CDO) and brother of CDO (BOC) in a conserved manner.","Hedgehog (Hh) signaling proteins stimulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue patterning at multiple points in animal development. A single Hh homolog is present in Drosophila, but three Hh homologs, Sonic Hh, Indian Hh, and Desert Hh, are present in mammals. Distribution, movement, and reception of Hh signals are tightly regulated, and abnormal Hh signaling is associated with developmental defects and cancer. In addition to the integral membrane proteins Patched and Smoothened, members of the Drosophila Ihog family of adhesion-like molecules have recently been shown to bind Hh proteins with micromolar affinity and positively regulate Hh signaling. Cell adhesion molecule-related, down-regulated by oncogenes (CDO) and Brother of CDO (BOC) are the closest mammalian relatives of Drosophila Ihog, and CDO binds Sonic Hh with micromolar affinity and positively regulates Hh signaling. Despite these similarities, structural and biochemical studies have shown that Ihog and CDO utilize nonorthologous domains and completely different binding modes to interact with cognate Hh proteins. We report here biochemical and x-ray structural studies of Sonic, Indian, and Desert Hh proteins both alone and complexed with active domains of CDO and BOC. These results show that all mammalian Hh proteins bind CDO and BOC in the same manner. We also show that interactions between Hh proteins and CDO are weakened at low pH. Formation of Hh-mediated Hh oligomers is thought to be an important feature of normal Hh signaling, but no conserved self-interaction between Hh proteins is apparent from inspection of 14 independent Hh-containing crystal lattices.",,
14596620,All three LDL receptor homology regions of the LDL receptor-related protein bind multiple ligands.,"The three complete human LDL receptor homology regions of the LDL receptor-related protein (sLRP2, sLRP3, and sLRP4) have been expressed in Pichia pastoris SMD1168 with constitutive coexpression of the receptor-associated protein (RAP). Each sLRP was purified to homogeneity after deglycosylation using a combination of anion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography. Mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing confirmed the identity of each fragment at purified yields of several milligrams per liter. Despite the large number of disulfide linkages and glycosylation sites in each LDL receptor homology region (sLRP), all were shown to be competent for binding to several LRP1 ligands. Each sLRP also bound human RAP, which is thought to be a generalized receptor antagonist, in solution-binding experiments. As expected, sLRP2 bound the receptor-binding domain of alpha(2)-macroglobulin (residues 1304-1451). All three sLRPs bound human apolipoprotein-enriched beta very low density lipoprotein, the canonical ligand for this receptor. All three sLRPs also bound lactoferrin and thrombin-protease nexin 1 complexes. Only sLRP4 bound thrombin-antithrombin III complexes. The results show that binding-competent LDL receptor homology regions (sLRPs) can be produced in high yield in P. pastoris and readily purified. Each sLRP has binding sites for multiple ligands, but not all ligand binding could be competed by RAP.",Biochemistry,2003
11533490,Allosteric activation of a spring-loaded natriuretic peptide receptor dimer by hormone.,"Natriuretic peptides (NPs) are vasoactive cyclic-peptide hormones important in blood pressure regulation through interaction with natriuretic cell-surface receptors. We report the hormone-binding thermodynamics and crystal structures at 2.9 and 2.0 angstroms, respectively, of the extracellular domain of the unliganded human NP receptor (NPR-C) and its complex with CNP, a 22-amino acid NP. A single CNP molecule is bound in the interface of an NPR-C dimer, resulting in asymmetric interactions between the hormone and the symmetrically related receptors. Hormone binding induces a 20 angstrom closure between the membrane-proximal domains of the dimer. In each monomer, the opening of an interdomain cleft, which is tethered together by a linker peptide acting as a molecular spring, is likely a conserved allosteric trigger for intracellular signaling by the natriuretic receptor family.",,
14610079,Alpha(v)beta3 and alpha(v)beta5 integrins bind both the proximal RGD site and non-RGD motifs within noncollagenous (NC1) domain of the alpha3 chain of type IV collagen: implication for the mechanism of endothelia cell adhesion.,"The NC1 domains of human type IV collagen, in particular alpha3NC1, are inhibitors of angiogenesis and tumor growth (Petitclerc, E., Boutaud, A., Prestayko, A., Xu, J., Sado, Y., Ninomiya, Y., Sarras, M. P., Jr., Hudson, B. G., and Brooks, P. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 8051-8061). The recombinant alpha3NC1 domain contained a RGD site as part of a short collagenous sequence at the N terminus, designated herein as RGD-alpha3NC1. Others, using synthetic peptides, have concluded that this RGD site is nonfunctional in cell adhesion, and therefore, the anti-angiogenic activity is attributed exclusively to alpha(v)beta(3) integrin interactions with non-RGD motifs of the RGD-alpha3NC1 domain (Maeshima, Y., Colorado, P. C., and Kalluri, R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 23745-23750). This nonfunctionality is surprising given that RGD is a binding site for alpha(v)beta(3) integrin in several proteins. In the present study, we used the alpha3NC1 domain with or without the RGD site, expressed in HEK 293 cells for native conformation, as an alternative approach to synthetic peptides to assess the functionality of the RGD site and non-RGD motifs. Our results demonstrate a predominant role of the RGD site for endothelial adhesion and for binding of alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(v)beta(5) integrins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the two non-RGD peptides, previously identified as the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-binding sites of the alpha3NC1 domain, are 10-fold less potent in competing for integrin binding than the native protein, indicating the importance of additional structural and/or conformational features of the alpha3NC1 domain for integrin binding. Therefore, the RGD site, in addition to non-RGD motifs, may contribute to the mechanisms of endothelial cell adhesion in the human vasculature and the anti-angiogenic activity of the RGD-alpha3NC1 domain.",,
16630822,Alpha3Na+/K+-ATPase is a neuronal receptor for agrin.,"Agrin, through its interaction with the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK, mediates accumulation of acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at the developing neuromuscular junction. Agrin has also been implicated in several functions in brain. However, the mechanism by which agrin exerts its effects in neural tissue is unknown. Here we present biochemical evidence that agrin binds to the alpha3 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) in CNS neurons. Colocalization with agrin binding sites at synapses supports the hypothesis that the alpha3NKA is a neuronal agrin receptor. Agrin inhibition of alpha3NKA activity results in membrane depolarization and increased action potential frequency in cortical neurons in culture and acute slice. An agrin fragment that acts as a competitive antagonist depresses action potential frequency, showing that endogenous agrin regulates native alpha3NKA function. These data demonstrate that, through its interaction with the alpha3NKA, agrin regulates activity-dependent processes in neurons, providing a molecular framework for agrin action in the CNS.",Cell,2006
14699013,Alpha4beta1 integrin mediates selective endothelial cell responses to thrombospondins 1 and 2 in vitro and modulates angiogenesis in vivo.,"We examined the function of alpha4beta1 integrin in angiogenesis and in mediating endothelial cell responses to the angiogenesis modulators, thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2. Alpha4beta1 supports adhesion of venous endothelial cells but not of microvascular endothelial cells on immobilized thrombospondin-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, or recombinant N-terminal regions of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2. Chemotactic activities of this region of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 are also mediated by alpha4beta1, whereas antagonism of fibroblast growth factor-2-stimulated chemotaxis is not mediated by this region. Immobilized N-terminal regions of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 promote endothelial cell survival and proliferation in an alpha4beta1-dependent manner. Soluble alpha4beta1 antagonists inhibit angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane and neovascularization of mouse muscle explants. The latter inhibition is thrombospondin-1-dependent and not observed in explants from thrombospondin-1-/- mice. Antagonizing alpha4beta1 may in part block proangiogenic activities of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2, because N-terminal regions of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 containing the alpha4beta1 binding sequence stimulate angiogenesis in vivo. Therefore, alpha4beta1 is an important endothelial cell receptor for mediating motility and proliferative responses to thrombospondins and for modulation of angiogenesis.",,
15466886,"alpha4beta1- and alpha6beta1-integrins are functional receptors for midkine, a heparin-binding growth factor.","Midkine is a heparin-binding growth factor that promotes the growth, survival, migration and differentiation of various target cells. So far, receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta, low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related protein and anaplastic lymphoma kinase have been identified as receptors for midkine. We found beta1 integrin in midkine-binding proteins from 13-day-old mouse embryos. beta1-Integrin bound to a midkine-agarose column and was eluted mostly with EDTA. Further study revealed that the alpha-subunits capable of binding to midkine were alpha4 and alpha6. Purified alpha4beta1- and alpha6beta1-integrins bound midkine. Anti-alpha4 antibody inhibited the midkine-dependent migration of osteoblastic cells, and anti-alpha6 antibody inhibited the midkine-dependent neurite outgrowth of embryonic neurons. After midkine treatment, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, an integrin-associated molecule, was transiently increased in osteoblastic cells. Therefore, we concluded that alpha4beta1- and alpha6beta1-integrins are functional receptors for midkine. We observed that the low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related-protein-6 ectodomain was immunoprecipitated with alpha6beta1-integrin and alpha4beta1-integrin. The low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related-protein-6 ectodomain was also immunoprecipitated with receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta. alpha4beta1- and alpha6beta1-Integrins are expected to co-operate with other midkine receptors, possibly in a multimolecular complex that contains other midkine receptors.",Journal of cell science,2004
15031111,"Alpha5beta1, alphaVbeta3 and the platelet-associated integrin alphaIIbbeta3 coordinately regulate adhesion and migration of differentiating mouse trophoblast cells.","During blastocyst implantation, interaction between integrins on the apical surface of the trophoblast and extracellular matrix (ECM) in the endometrium anchors the embryo to the uterine wall. Strong adhesion of the blastocyst to fibronectin (FN) requires integrin signaling initiated by exogenous fibronectin. However, it is not known how integrin signaling enhances blastocyst adhesion. We present new evidence that the integrin, alphaIIbbeta3, plays a key role in trophoblast adhesion to fibronectin during mouse peri-implantation development. Trafficking of alphaIIb to the apical surface of the trophoblast increased dramatically after blastocysts were exposed to fibronectin, whereas other fibronectin-binding integrins, alpha5beta1 and alphaVbeta3, were resident at the apical surface before ligand exposure. Functional comparisons among the three integrins revealed that ligation of alpha5beta1 most efficiently strengthened blastocyst fibronectin-binding activity, while subsequent trophoblast cell migration was dependent primarily on the beta3-class integrins. In vivo, alphaIIb was highly expressed by invasive trophoblast cells in the ectoplacental cone and trophoblast giant cells of the parietal yolk sac. These data demonstrate that trafficking of alphaIIb regulates adhesion between trophoblast cells and fibronectin as invasion of the endometrium commences.",Developmental biology,2004
11487023,AlphaIIbbeta3 and its antagonism at the new millennium.,"Because of its major role in regulating platelet functions and its prominence on the cell surface, integrin alphaIIbbeta3 has been the subject of intensive investigations. Such studies have provided substantial insights into its structure-function relationships and have led to the development of anti-thrombotic drugs that target the receptor. Nevertheless, recent findings have indicated that our understanding of the structure and function of alphaIIbbeta3 remains inadequate. This article addresses two aspects of still evolving alphaIIbbeta3 function: 1) the interface between alphaIIbbeta3 and the blood coagulation system, resulting from interaction of prothrombin with the receptor; and 2) the molecular basis for recognition of the RGD and the fibrinogen gamma-chain peptide ligands by alphaIIbbeta3. As illustrated by these two examples, there is still much to be learned about alphaIIbbeta3 if we are to fully appreciate its functions and its potential as a therapeutic target.",,
11073102,"AlphaMbeta2 (CD11b/CD18, Mac-1) integrin activation by a unique monoclonal antibody to alphaM I domain that is divalent cation-sensitive.","The beta2 (CD18) leukocyte integrins play a key role in normal and inflammatory immune responses. In resting leukocytes, these receptors do not bind ligands. However, when leukocytes are exposed to an appropriate agonist, high-affinity ligand binding is achieved, presumably as a result of conformational changes in the integrin. In this study, we describe a novel monoclonal antibody, mAb 6C1, directed against the alphaM subunit, which directly induces adhesion of alphaMbeta2-transfected CHO cells to fibrinogen, ICAM-1, and iC3b. Induction of binding could also be accomplished by monovalent Fab fragments of mAb 6C1 at concentrations similar to that observed with intact IgG, demonstrating stimulation of adhesion was not because of receptor cross-linking at the cell surface. The binding of mAb 6C1 induces conformational changes in the receptor, as evidenced by the expression of an ""activation reporter"" epitope recognized by mAb 24. The binding of mAb 6C1 is modulated by divalent cations. Mn2+ promoted high levels of 6C1 binding, and Mg2+ supported low levels of binding, however Ca2+ failed to support binding. A unique distinction of mAb 6C1 is localization of its epitope to the alphaM I domain. The alphaM I domain is essential for ligand binding, can directly bind divalent cations, and participates in the regulation of alphaMbeta2 ligand-binding affinity. Thus, these studies have identified a novel alphaM I domain activation epitope of alphaMbeta2 and support the idea that the I domain modulates the activational state of the beta2 integrins.",,
32358586,Alternative splicing controls teneurin-latrophilin interaction and synapse specificity by a shape-shifting mechanism.,"The trans-synaptic interaction of the cell-adhesion molecules teneurins (TENs) with latrophilins (LPHNs/ADGRLs) promotes excitatory synapse formation when LPHNs simultaneously interact with FLRTs. Insertion of a short alternatively-spliced region within TENs abolishes the TEN-LPHN interaction and switches TEN function to specify inhibitory synapses. How alternative-splicing regulates TEN-LPHN interaction remains unclear. Here, we report the 2.9 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the TEN2-LPHN3 complex, and describe the trimeric TEN2-LPHN3-FLRT3 complex. The structure reveals that the N-terminal lectin domain of LPHN3 binds to the TEN2 barrel at a site far away from the alternatively spliced region. Alternative-splicing regulates the TEN2-LPHN3 interaction by hindering access to the LPHN-binding surface rather than altering it. Strikingly, mutagenesis of the LPHN-binding surface of TEN2 abolishes the LPHN3 interaction and impairs excitatory but not inhibitory synapse formation. These results suggest that a multi-level coincident binding mechanism mediated by a cryptic adhesion complex between TENs and LPHNs regulates synapse specificity.",Nature communications,2020
8703026,Alternative splicing in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor modulates receptor selectivity and relative potencies of PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 in phospholipase C activation.,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-27 and PACAP-38 are neuropeptides of the vasoactive intestinal peptide/secretin/glucagon family. We previously described alternative splicing of the region encoding the third intracellular loop of the PACAP receptor generating six isoforms with differential signal transduction properties (Spengler, D., Waeber, C., Pantaloni, C., Holsboer, F., Bockaert, J., Seeburg, P. H., and Journot, L. (1993) Nature 365, 170-175). In addition, we demonstrated that the potencies of the two forms of PACAP are similar for adenylate cyclase stimulation, whereas PACAP-38 is more potent than PACAP-27 in phospholipase C activation. In the present work, we document the existence of a new splice variant of the PACAP receptor that was characterized by a 21-amino-acid deletion in the N-terminal extracellular domain. We demonstrate that this domain modulates receptor selectivity with respect to PACAP-27 and -38 binding and controls the relative potencies of the two agonists in phospholipase C stimulation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
21149578,Ameloblastin regulates osteogenic differentiation by inhibiting Src kinase via cross talk between integrin beta1 and CD63.,"Ameloblastin, the most abundant nonamelogenin enamel matrix protein, plays a role in ameloblast differentiation. Here, we found that ameloblastin was expressed in osteosarcoma cells; to explore the potential functions of ameloblastin in osteoblasts, we investigated whether this protein is involved in osteogenic differentiation and bone formation on the premise that CD63, a member of the transmembrane-4 glycoprotein superfamily, interacts with integrins in the presence of ameloblastin. Ameloblastin bound to CD63 and promoted CD63 binding to integrin β1. The interaction between CD63 and integrin β1 induced Src kinase inactivation via the binding of CD63 to Src. The reduction of Src activity and osteogenic differentiation mediated by ameloblastin were abrogated by treatment with anti-CD63 antibody and overexpression of constitutively active Src, respectively. Therefore, our results suggest that ameloblastin is expressed in osteoblasts and functions as a promoting factor for osteogenic differentiation via a novel pathway through the interaction between CD63 and integrin β1.",Molecular and cellular biology,2011

Although Abeta has been reported to be directly neurotoxic, it also causes indirect neuronal damage by activating mononuclear phagocytes (microglia) that accumulate in and around senile plaques. In this study, we show that the 42 amino acid form of beta amyloid peptide, Abeta(42), is a chemotactic agonist for a seven-transmembrane, G-protein-coupled receptor named FPR-Like-1 (FPRL1), which is expressed on human mononuclear phagocytes. Moreover, FPRL1 is expressed at high levels by inflammatory cells infiltrating senile plaques in brain tissues from AD patients. Thus, FPRL1 may mediate inflammation seen in AD and is a potential target for developing therapeutic agents.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2001
19184004,Amyloid precursor-like protein 2 association with HLA class I molecules.,"Amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) is a ubiquitously expressed protein. The previously demonstrated functions for APLP2 include binding to the mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule H-2K(d) and down regulating its cell surface expression. In this study, we have investigated the interaction of APLP2 with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecule in human tumor cell lines. APLP2 was readily detected in pancreatic, breast, and prostate tumor lines, although it was found only in very low amounts in lymphoma cell lines. In a pancreatic tumor cell line, HLA class I was extensively co-localized with APLP2 in vesicular compartments following endocytosis of HLA class I molecules. In pancreatic, breast, and prostate tumor lines, APLP2 was bound to the HLA class I molecule. APLP2 was found to bind to HLA-A24, and more strongly to HLA-A2. Increased expression of APLP2 resulted in reduced surface expression of HLA-A2 and HLA-A24. Overall, these studies demonstrate that APLP2 binds to the HLA class I molecule, co-localizes with it in intracellular vesicles, and reduces the level of HLA class I molecule cell surface expression.",,
11316806,"Amyloid-beta induces chemotaxis and oxidant stress by acting at formylpeptide receptor 2, a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in phagocytes and brain.","Amyloid-beta, the pathologic protein in Alzheimer's disease, induces chemotaxis and production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytic cells, but mechanisms have not been fully defined. Here we provide three lines of evidence that the phagocyte G protein-coupled receptor (N-formylpeptide receptor 2 (FPR2)) mediates these amyloid-beta-dependent functions in phagocytic cells. First, transfection of FPR2, but not related receptors, including the other known N-formylpeptide receptor FPR, reconstituted amyloid-beta-dependent chemotaxis and calcium flux in HEK 293 cells. Second, amyloid-beta induced both calcium flux and chemotaxis in mouse neutrophils (which express endogenous FPR2) with similar potency as in FPR2-transfected HEK 293 cells. This activity could be specifically desensitized in both cell types by preincubation with a specific FPR2 agonist, which desensitizes the receptor, or with pertussis toxin, which uncouples it from G(i)-dependent signaling. Third, specific and reciprocal desensitization of superoxide production was observed when N-formylpeptides and amyloid-beta were used to sequentially stimulate neutrophils from FPR -/- mice, which express FPR2 normally. Potential biological relevance of these results to the neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease was suggested by two additional findings: first, FPR2 mRNA could be detected by PCR in mouse brain; second, induction of FPR2 expression correlated with induction of calcium flux and chemotaxis by amyloid-beta in the mouse microglial cell line N9. Further, in sequential stimulation experiments with N9 cells, N-formylpeptides and amyloid-beta were able to reciprocally cross-desensitize each other. Amyloid-beta was also a specific agonist at the human counterpart of FPR2, the FPR-like 1 receptor. These results suggest a unified signaling mechanism for linking amyloid-beta to phagocyte chemotaxis and oxidant stress in the brain.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
12782716,"An alternatively spliced variant of CXCR3 mediates the inhibition of endothelial cell growth induced by IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC, and acts as functional receptor for platelet factor 4.","The chemokines CXCL9/Mig, CXCL10/IP-10, and CXCL11/I-TAC regulate lymphocyte chemotaxis, mediate vascular pericyte proliferation, and act as angiostatic agents, thus inhibiting tumor growth. These multiple activities are apparently mediated by a unique G protein-coupled receptor, termed CXCR3. The chemokine CXCL4/PF4 shares several activities with CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, including a powerful angiostatic effect, but its specific receptor is still unknown. Here, we describe a distinct, previously unrecognized receptor named CXCR3-B, derived from an alternative splicing of the CXCR3 gene that mediates the angiostatic activity of CXCR3 ligands and also acts as functional receptor for CXCL4. Human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1), transfected with either the known CXCR3 (renamed CXCR3-A) or CXCR3-B, bound CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, whereas CXCL4 showed high affinity only for CXCR3-B. Overexpression of CXCR3-A induced an increase of survival, whereas overexpression of CXCR3-B dramatically reduced DNA synthesis and up-regulated apoptotic HMEC-1 death through activation of distinct signal transduction pathways. Remarkably, primary cultures of human microvascular endothelial cells, whose growth is inhibited by CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL4, expressed CXCR3-B, but not CXCR3-A. Finally, monoclonal antibodies raised to selectively recognize CXCR3-B reacted with endothelial cells from neoplastic tissues, providing evidence that CXCR3-B is also expressed in vivo and may account for the angiostatic effects of CXC chemokines.",,
10342886,An amylin receptor is revealed following co-transfection of a calcitonin receptor with receptor activity modifying proteins-1 or -3.,"Human receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMP) regulate the ligand specificity of the calcitonin-receptor-like-receptor (McLatchie et al., Nature 393:333-339 (1998)). Here we have investigated binding of [125I]-labeled human (h) calcitonin ([125I]hCT) and rat amylin ([125I]amylin) to rabbit aortic endothelial cells (RAEC) co-transfected with the hCT receptor isotype 2 (hCTR2) and RAMP1, -2 or -3. Specific binding of 125 pM [125I]hCT to cells transfected with hCTR2 alone was 6.7 +/- 0.7 fmol/50,000 cells (n=5), and was reduced by 45 +/- 2% and 86 +/- 3% (P < 0.001) in the presence of RAMP1 and -3, but remained unchanged with RAMP2. In the absence and presence of individual RAMPs [125I]hCT binding inhibition occured with similar IC50 of between 6 nM and 11 nM hCT, and human amylin was 24- to 54-fold less potent. Specific binding of 125 pM [125I]amylin to cells transfected with hCTR2 alone was 0.9 +/- 0.2 fmol/50,000 cells (n=6), and was increased by 262 +/- 48% (P < 0.005), 73 +/- 26% (P < 0.05) and 338 +/- 57% (P < 0.005) with RAMP1, -2 or -3, respectively. [125I]amylin binding was inhibited with IC50 of 3.1 +/- 0.5 nM and 4.0 +/- 0.8 nM human amylin in cells co-transfected with RAMP1 or -3, respectively, and hCT was 45 +/- 2- and 126 +/- 3-fold less potent. In conclusion, RAMP1 and -3 decrease calcitonin receptor expression in RAEC transfected with hCTR2 encoding cDNA and simultanously reveal an amylin receptor.",Endocrinology,1999
15187149,An annexin 1 N-terminal peptide activates leukocytes by triggering different members of the formyl peptide receptor family.,"The human N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) is a key modulator of chemotaxis directing granulocytes toward sites of bacterial infections. FPR is the founding member of a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors thought to function in inflammatory processes. The other two members, FPR-like (FPRL)1 and FPRL2, have a greatly reduced affinity for bacterial peptides or do not bind them at all, with FPRL2 being considered an orphan receptor so far. In this study we show that a peptide derived from the N-terminal domain of the anti-inflammatory protein annexin 1 (lipocortin 1) can activate all three FPR family members at similar concentrations. The annexin 1 peptide initiates chemotactic responses in human monocytes that express all three FPR family members and also desensitizes the cells toward subsequent stimulation with bacterial peptide agonists. Experiments using HEK 293 cells stably expressing a single FPR family member reveal that all three receptors can be activated and desensitized by the N-terminal annexin 1 peptide. These observations identify the annexin 1 peptide as the first endogenous ligand of FPRL2 and indicate that annexin 1 participates in regulating leukocyte emigration into inflamed tissue by activating and desensitizing different receptors of the FPR family.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2004
9242610,An antagonist decoy receptor and a death domain-containing receptor for TRAIL.,"TRAIL, also called Apo2L, is a cytotoxic protein that induces apoptosis of many transformed cell lines but not of normal tissues, even though its death domain-containing receptor, DR4, is expressed on both cell types. An antagonist decoy receptor (designated as TRID for TRAIL receptor without an intracellular domain) that may explain the resistant phenotype of normal tissues was identified. TRID is a distinct gene product with an extracellular TRAIL-binding domain and a transmembrane domain but no intracellular signaling domain. TRID transcripts were detected in many normal human tissues but not in most cancer cell lines examined. Ectopic expression of TRID protected mammalian cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which is consistent with a protective role. Another death domain-containing receptor for TRAIL (designated as death receptor-5), which preferentially engaged a FLICE (caspase-8)-related death protease, was also identified.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1997
9808045,An antagonist peptide-EPO receptor complex suggests that receptor dimerization is not sufficient for activation.,"Dimerization of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR), in the presence of either natural (EPO) or synthetic (EPO-mimetic peptides, EMPs) ligands is the principal extracellular event that leads to receptor activation. The crystal structure of the extracellular domain of EPOR bound to an inactive (antagonist) peptide at 2.7 A resolution has unexpectedly revealed that dimerization still occurs, but the orientation between receptor molecules is altered relative to active (agonist) peptide complexes. Comparison of the biological properties of agonist and antagonist EMPs with EPO suggests that the extracellular domain orientation is tightly coupled to the cytoplasmic signaling events and, hence, provides valuable new insights into the design of synthetic ligands for EPOR and other cytokine receptors.",,
10942781,An anti-oncogenic role for decorin. Down-regulation of ErbB2 leads to growth suppression and cytodifferentiation of mammary carcinoma cells.,"The leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor and triggers a signaling pathway that leads to growth suppression. We find that decorin causes a functional inactivation of the oncogenic ErbB2 protein in breast carcinoma cells. Upon de novo expression of decorin, the ErbB2 protein is reduced by approximately 40%, whereas its degree of tyrosyl phosphorylation is almost completely abrogated. Both co-culture experiments or experiments with recombinant decorin demonstrate an initial induction of ErbB2 tyrosine kinase, followed by a profound and long-lasting down-regulation of its activity. This leads to growth inhibition and cytodifferentiation of mammary tumor cells and a concurrent suppression of their tumorigenic potential in vivo. These decorin-mediated effects appear to involve the activation of ErbB4, which in turn would block the phosphorylation of heterodimers containing either ErbB2 or ErbB3. These results provide an explanation for the heightened decorin levels around invasive carcinomas and suggest that decorin may function as a natural antagonist of neoplastic cells enriched in ErbB2.",,
1939101,An antibody that inhibits the binding of diphtheria toxin to cells revealed the association of a 27-kDa membrane protein with the diphtheria toxin receptor.,"A monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of diphtheria toxin to Vero cells was isolated by immunizing mice with Vero cell membrane. The antibody inhibits the binding of diphtheria toxin and also CRM197, a mutant form of diphtheria toxin, to Vero cells, and consequently inhibits the cytotoxicity of diphtheria toxin. This antibody does not directly react with the receptor molecule of diphtheria toxin (DTR14.5). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies revealed that this antibody binds to a novel membrane protein of 27 kDa (DRAP27). When diphtheria toxin receptor was passed through an affinity column made with this antibody, the receptor was trapped only in the presence of DRAP27. These results indicate that DRAP27 and DTR14.5 closely associate in Vero cell membrane and that the inhibition of the binding of diphtheria toxin to the receptor is due to the binding of the antibody to the DRAP27 molecule. Binding studies using 125I-labeled antibody showed that there are many more molecules of DRAP27 on the cell surface than diphtheria toxin-binding sites. However, there is a correlation between the sensitivity of a cell line to diphtheria toxin and the number of DRAP27 molecules on the cell surface, suggesting that DRAP27 is involved in the entry of diphtheria toxin into the target cell.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1991
15728350,An atomic resolution view of ICAM recognition in a complex between the binding domains of ICAM-3 and integrin alphaLbeta2.,"Within the Ig superfamily (IgSF), intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) form a subfamily that binds the leukocyte integrin alphaLbeta2. We report a 1.65-A-resolution crystal structure of the ICAM-3 N-terminal domain (D1) in complex with the inserted domain, the ligand-binding domain of alphaLbeta2. This high-resolution structure and comparisons among ICAM subfamily members establish that the binding of ICAM-3 D1 onto the inserted domain represents a common docking mode for ICAM subfamily members. The markedly different off-rates of ICAM-1, -2, and -3 appear to be determined by the hydrophobicity of residues that surround a metal coordination bond in the alphaLbeta2-binding interfaces. Variation in composition of glycans on the periphery of the interfaces influences on-rate.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2005
2478219,An integrin receptor on normal and thrombasthenic platelets that binds thrombospondin.,"The members of the integrin family of membrane glycoprotein heterodimer complexes function as cell surface receptors for adhesive proteins. We report here on the identification of two integrins on the surface of human platelets that bind to thrombospondin. When platelet membrane proteins are radiolabeled with 125I-lactoperoxidase, solubilized in n-octylglucoside, (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), and applied to a column of thrombospondin-Sepharose, both complexes are bound to the column and specifically eluted with the peptide GRGDSP. One of these integrins, glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa, appears to bind relatively weakly. The second integrin shares the same beta subunit (beta 3 or GPIIIa), but has a distinct alpha subunit that comigrates with the alpha subunit (alpha v) of the vitronectin receptor (VnR) on endothelial cells and reacts with a monoclonal antibody, LM142, which was raised against an integrin from M21 melanoma cells. The alpha v beta 3 integrin is present on a variety of cell types and appears to act as a receptor for thrombospondin on endothelial and smooth muscle cells. On endothelial and M21 melanoma cells this receptor is also involved in adhesion to fibrinogen, vitronectin, and von Willebrand factor (vWF). The alpha v beta 3 integrin is present at approximately equal levels on normal and thrombasthenic platelets, whereas levels of GPIIb-IIIa are greatly reduced on thrombasthenic platelets. The alpha v beta 3 integrin on thrombasthenic platelets also binds to thrombospondin-Sepharose and can be eluted with the peptide GRGDSP. These data indicate that the alpha v beta 3 integrin on platelets, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells functions as an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-dependent receptor for thrombospondin.",,
9659900,An orphan receptor tyrosine kinase family whose members serve as nonintegrin collagen receptors.,"Mammalian cells constantly monitor and respond to a myriad of extracellular signals, often by using cell surface receptors. Two important classes of cell surface receptors include the receptor tyrosine kinases, which recognize peptide growth factors such as insulin, and the integrins, which most often mediate binding to components of the extracellular matrix. We report that the collagens serve as ligands for the previously orphan family of discoidin domain-containing receptor-like tyrosine kinases. The unexpected realization that an extracellular matrix molecule can directly serve as a ligand for receptor tyrosine kinases provides an example of ligands shared by integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases, and this finding seems likely to change prevailing views about the mechanisms by which cells perceive and respond to the extracellular matrix.",,
9928018,"Analogues of VIP, helodermin, and PACAP discriminate between rat and human VIP1 and VIP2 receptors.","Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) acts through interaction with two subclasses of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors named VIP1 and VIP2 receptors. These receptors have been cloned in different species, such as rat and human. Considering the different distribution of both receptor subclasses, there is considerable interest in the development of selective agonists and antagonists. The present study compares the binding properties of VIP, PACAP, GRF, secretin, and helodermin analogues on recombinant rat and human VIP1 and VIP2 receptors. On both rat and human receptors, secretin and GRF had a higher affinity for the VIP1 receptor subtypes. The amino-shortened VIP, and the carboxy terminal-shortened VIP and PACAP analogues also presented a higher affinity for the VIP1 receptor. PHI, PHV, helodermin, and helospectin were selective for the human VIP2 receptor subtypes. These results suggest that the helical structure of the carboxy terminal end is necessary for VIP2 recognition. The differences between species were the following: PHI, PHV, helodermin, and helospectin had a higher affinity for the rat VIP1 receptor than for the human VIP1 receptor. On both rat and human receptors, D-Ala4 VIP and D-Phe4 VIP had a high affinity for the VIP1 receptor and a low affinity for the VIP2 receptor. Thus, three domains of the ligand involved in VIP1/VIP2 receptor discrimination were identified: the amino acid residue in position 4 ([D-Ala4], [D-Phe4]VIP), in positions 8 and 9 (the effects of helodermin and helospectin), and the carboxy terminal end (the effects of the shortened VIP and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide analogues).",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,1998
9045669,"Analysis of 4-1BBL and laminin binding to murine 4-1BB, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, and comparison with human 4-1BB.","The T cell activation antigen 4-1BB (CDw137) is a distantly related member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family of cell surface receptors. We previously reported that murine 4-1BB (m4-1BB) bound to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Recently, a tumor necrosis factor-like ligand of m4-1BB, m4-1BBL, as well as the human counterparts of 4-1BB (ILA) and 4-1BBL (h4-1BB and h4-1BBL, respectively) have been cloned. No information is currently available on how binding of m4-1BB to ECM proteins affects its binding to m4-1BBL and vice versa and if the ability of m4-1BB to bind ECM proteins is conserved across species. We report that binding of m4-1BBL to m4-1BB blocked its ability to bind laminin (LN), while binding of m4-1BB to LN did not block its ability to bind m4-1BBL. Furthermore, binding of m4-1BBL to the m4-1BB.LN complex did not displace LN. These findings suggest the two ligands bind to proximal but distinct sites on m4-1BB. This is supported by the observation that six of eight anti-m4-1BB monoclonal antibodies blocked the interaction between 4-1BB and 4-1BBL, while seven blocked LN binding. Ligand and monoclonal antibody binding studies with a truncated protein lacking the amino-terminal LN-homologous domain of m4-1BB demonstrated that regions downstream of the LN-homologous domain participate in LN binding and that the intact protein is required for m4-1BBL binding. Studies with h4-1BB showed that h4-1BB only bound h4-1BBL, indicating that the ECM binding activity of 4-1BB is not conserved across species. This finding allowed the construction of murine/human 4-1BB chimeras, which permitted further dissection of the regions of 4-1BB involved in LN and 4-1BBL binding and suggests that sequence differences in the LN-homologous domain of h4-1BB in part account for the inability of h4-1BB to bind ECM proteins.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
7543281,Analysis of gp39/CD40 interactions using molecular models and site-directed mutagenesis.,"The interaction between gp39 (CD40L, TRAP, T-BAM) on activated T cells and mast cells and CD40 on antigen-presenting cells modulates immune responses. Gp39 and CD40 are homologous to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and its receptor (TNFR), respectively. The TNF-beta/TNFR interaction has been analyzed on the basis of mutagenesis experiments and crystal structures. Using the interaction of TNF-beta/TNFR as a guide, we previously reported a site-directed mutagenesis study in which we identified residues in gp39 (K143, Y145) and CD40 (Y82, D84, N86) involved in gp39/CD40 interactions. Here we describe the use of the TNF-beta/TNFR complex crystal structure as a template to prepare molecular models of gp39, CD40, and their approximate interaction. The application of these models has allowed us to extend our mutagenesis analysis of gp39/CD40 interactions. These experiments have led to the identification of additional gp39 (Y146, R203, Q220) and CD40 (E74, E117) residues that contribute to the gp39/CD40 interaction. We also further explored the importance of gp39 residue Y145 and CD40 residue Y82 for the gp39/CD40 interaction by conservatively replacing these residues with Phe. The results of these studies have enabled us to approximately outline the binding sites in gp39 and CD40. It appears that the gp39/CD40 interaction is centered on at least two clusters of residues and involves residues of two adjacent gp39 monomers. The molecular regions involved in the gp39/CD40 interaction essentially correspond to those in the homologous TNF-beta/TNFR system.",Biochemistry,1995
12139915,Analysis of interactions of the adhesion molecule TAG-1 and its domains with other immunoglobulin superfamily members.,"Cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily promote cell aggregation and neurite outgrowth via homophilic and heterophilic interactions. The transient axonal glycoprotein TAG-1 induces cell aggregation through homophilic interaction of its fibronectin repeats. We investigated the domains responsible for the neurite outgrowth promoting activity of TAG-1 as well as its interactions with other cell adhesion molecules. Binding experiments with Fc-chimeric proteins revealed that TAG-1 interacts with L1, NrCAM, and F3/contactin. The membrane-associated as opposed to the soluble form of TAG-1 behaves differently in these assays. We demonstrate that both the immunoglobulin as well as the fibronectin domains promote neurite outgrowth when used as substrates. Furthermore we investigated the putative role of L1 and NrCAM as the neuronal TAG-1 receptors mediating neurite extension. DRG neurons from L1-deficient mice were found to extend neurites on TAG-1 substrates and blocking NrCAM function did not diminish the TAG-1-dependent neurite outgrowth. These results indicate that neither L1 nor NrCAM are required for TAG-1-elicited neurite outgrowth.",Molecular and cellular neurosciences,2002
7822326,Analysis of the binding site on intercellular adhesion molecule 3 for the leukocyte integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1.,"Intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3, CD50) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is a constitutively expressed ligand for the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18). ICAM-3 is expressed at high levels by all resting leukocyte populations and antigen presenting cells and is a major ligand for LFA-1 in the resting immune system. ICAM-3 is a signal transducer and may play a key role in initiating immune responses. Mutant ICAM-3 Fc-chimeric proteins were quantitatively analyzed for their ability to bind COS cells expressing human LFA-1. The LFA-1-binding site on ICAM-3 is located in the N-terminal 2 Ig domains. Domains 3-5 do not significantly contribute to adhesion. The binding site has been further resolved by rational targeting of 14 point mutations throughout domains 1 and 2, coupled with modeling studies. Within domain 1 a cluster of residues (Glu37, Leu66, Ser68, and Gln75), that are predicted to lie on the CC'FG face of the Ig fold, play a dominant role in LFA-1 binding.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1995
16081635,Analysis of the biochemical mechanisms for the endocrine actions of fibroblast growth factor-23.,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23 has emerged as an endocrine regulator of phosphate and of vitamin D metabolism. It is produced in bone and, unlike other FGFs, circulates in the bloodstream to ultimately regulate phosphate handling and vitamin D production in the kidney. Presently, it is unknown which of the seven principal FGF receptors (FGFRs) transmits FGF23 biological activity. Furthermore, the molecular basis for the endocrine mode of FGF23 action is unclear. Herein, we performed surface plasmon resonance and mitogenesis experiments to comprehensively characterize receptor binding specificity. Our data demonstrate that FGF23 binds and activates the c splice isoforms of FGFR1-3, as well as FGFR4, but not the b splice isoforms of FGFR1-3. Interestingly, highly sulfated and longer glycosaminoglycan (GAG) species were capable of promoting FGF23 mitogenic activity. We also show that FGF23 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibits sodium-phosphate cotransporter Npt2a mRNA expression using opossum kidney cells, a model kidney proximal tubule cell line. Removal of cell surface GAGs abolishes the effects of FGF23, and exogenous highly sulfated GAG is capable of restoring FGF23 activity, suggesting that proximal tubule cells naturally express GAGs that are permissive for FGF23 action. We propose that FGF23 signals through multiple FGFRs and that the unique endocrine actions of FGF23 involve escape from FGF23-producing cells and circulation to the kidney, where highly sulfated GAGs most likely act as cofactors for FGF23 activity. Our biochemical findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms by which dysregulated FGF23 signaling leads to disorders of hyper- and hypophosphatemia.",,

In clone 3 the receptor was expressed at some 2.2 pmol/mg of membrane protein, and G(o)1 alpha at approx. 100 pmol/mg of membrane protein. The interaction of these two polypeptides and that between the receptor and Gi2 alpha (endogenously expressed at some 50 pmol/mg of membrane protein) were studied. Agonist activation of G(o)1 alpha was observed in membranes of the alpha 2C10-adrenoceptor(+)-G(o)1 alpha+ cells (clone 3), but not in alpha 2C10-adrenoceptor(+)-G(o)alpha-cells (clone 1C), whereas similar agonist-dependent activation of Gi2 alpha was observed in both cell types. alpha 2C10-adrenoceptor activation of G(o)1 alpha and Gi2 alpha in clone-3 membranes was produced with similar agonist-dose-effect curves. These observations indicate that the receptor interacts with equivalent affinity with each of these G-proteins. Agonist-dependent cholera-toxin-catalysed [32P]ADP-ribosylation of G(o)1 alpha was terminated when the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine was added subsequent to agonist-induced initiation of the reaction and release of GDP, demonstrating the conformational requirement for this reaction to be the ternary complex of agonist-occupied receptor and guanine-nucleotide-denuded G-protein.",The Biochemical journal,1995

12427764,Angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 share the same binding domains in the Tie-2 receptor involving the first Ig-like loop and the epidermal growth factor-like repeats.,"Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) have been identified as ligands with different effector functions of the vascular assembly and maturation-mediating receptor tyrosine kinase Tie-2. To understand the molecular interactions of the angiopoietins with their receptor, we have studied the binding of Ang-1 and Ang-2 to the Tie-2 receptor. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based competition assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments analyzing the binding of Ang-1 and Ang-2 to truncation mutants of the extracellular domain of Tie-2 showed that the first Ig-like loop of Tie-2 in combination with the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (amino acids 1-360) is required for angiopoietin binding. The first Ig-like domain or the EGF-like repeats alone are not capable of binding Ang-1 and Ang-2. Concomitantly, we made the surprising finding that Tie-2 exon-2 knockout mice do express a mutated Tie-2 protein that lacks 104 amino acids of the first Ig-like domain. This mutant Tie-2 receptor is functionally inactive as shown by the lack of ligand binding and receptor phosphorylation. Collectively, the data show that the first 104 amino acids of the Tie-2 receptor are essential but not sufficient for angiopoietin binding. Conversely, the first 360 amino acids (Ig-like domain plus EGF-like repeats) of the Tie-2 receptor are necessary and sufficient to bind both Ang-1 and Ang-2, which suggests that differential receptor binding is not likely to be responsible for the different functions of Ang-1 and Ang-2.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
19379779,"Angiopoietin-1 induces neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells in a Tie2-independent, beta1-integrin-dependent manner.","Overexpression of angiopoietin (Ang) 1 in the brain results in increased vascularization and altered neuronal dendrite configuration. We hypothesized that Ang1 acts directly on neurons inducing neurite outgrowth. We stimulated PC12 cells with Ang1 and observed outgrowth levels comparable to nerve growth factor (NGF). Western blotting and RT-PCR demonstrated the absence of the Ang1 receptor, Tie2 and the presence of beta1-integrin. Downstream of beta1-integrin, Ang1 stimulation led to a approximately 2.6 fold increase in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and no change in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) nor c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Conversely, NGF stimulation had no effect on FAK phosphorylation but led to a approximately 3.1 and approximately 2 fold increase in phosphorylation of MAPK and JNK. Ang1, but not NGF-mediated outgrowth was attenuated following functional inhibition of beta1-integrin and FAK, and Wortmannin inhibited neurite outgrowth mediated by both. Our results suggest that Ang1 induces neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a Tie2-independent, beta1-integrin-FAK-PI3K-Akt-dependent manner and that NGF and Ang1 mediate neurite outgrowth via two independent signaling mechanisms.",,
9204896,"Angiopoietin-2, a natural antagonist for Tie2 that disrupts in vivo angiogenesis.","Angiogenesis is thought to depend on a precise balance of positive and negative regulation. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) is an angiogenic factor that signals through the endothelial cell-specific Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase. Like vascular endothelial growth factor, Ang1 is essential for normal vascular development in the mouse. An Ang1 relative, termed angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), was identified by homology screening and shown to be a naturally occurring antagonist for Ang1 and Tie2. Transgenic overexpression of Ang2 disrupts blood vessel formation in the mouse embryo. In adult mice and humans, Ang2 is expressed only at sites of vascular remodeling. Natural antagonists for vertebrate receptor tyrosine kinases are atypical; thus, the discovery of a negative regulator acting on Tie2 emphasizes the need for exquisite regulation of this angiogenic receptor system.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1997

Many cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins reportedly contribute to chondrocyte differentiation, indicating that mechanisms underlying chondrocyte differentiation are likely more complex than previously appreciated. Angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2) is a secreted factor normally abundantly produced in mesenchymal lineage cells such as adipocytes and fibroblasts, but its loss contributes to the pathogenesis of lifestyle- or aging-related diseases. However, the function of ANGPTL2 in chondrocytes, which are also differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells, remains unclear. Here, we investigate whether ANGPTL2 is expressed in or functions in chondrocytes.",Osteoarthritis and cartilage,2018
12958167,Angiopoietin-regulated recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells by endothelial-derived heparin binding EGF-like growth factor.,"Recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) by endothelial cells (EC) is essential for angiogenesis. Endothelial-derived heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) was shown to mediate this process by signaling via ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptors in SMCs. 1) Analysis of ErbB-ligands demonstrated that primary ECs expressed only HB-EGF and neuregulin-1. 2) Primary SMCs expressed ErbB1 and ErbB2, but not ErbB3 or ErbB4. 3) Consistent with their known receptor specificities, recombinant HB-EGF, but not neuregulin-1, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB1 and ErbB2 and migration in SMCs. 4) Neutralization of HB-EGF or inhibition of ErbB1 or ErbB2 blocked 70-90% of the potential of ECs to stimulate SMC migration. Moreover, 5) angiopoietin-1, an EC effector with a role in recruitment of SMC-like cells to vascular structures in vivo, enhanced EC-stimulated SMC migration by a mechanism involving up-regulation of endothelial HB-EGF. Finally, 6) immunohistochemical analysis of developing human tissues demonstrated that HB-EGF was expressed in vivo in ECs associated with SMCs or pericytes but not in ECs of the hyaloid vessels not associated with SMCs. These results suggest an important role for HB-EGF and ErbB receptors in the recruitment of SMCs by ECs and elaborate on the mechanism by which angiopoietins exert their vascular effects.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2003
10051567,Angiopoietins 3 and 4: diverging gene counterparts in mice and humans.,"The angiopoietins have recently joined the members of the vascular endothelial growth factor family as the only known growth factors largely specific for vascular endothelium. The angiopoietins include a naturally occurring agonist, angiopoietin-1, as well as a naturally occurring antagonist, angiopoietin-2, both of which act by means of the Tie2 receptor. We now report our attempts to use homology-based cloning approaches to identify new members of the angiopoietin family. These efforts have led to the identification of two new angiopoietins, angiopoietin-3 in mouse and angiopoietin-4 in human; we have also identified several more distantly related sequences that do not seem to be true angiopoietins, in that they do not bind to the Tie receptors. Although angiopoietin-3 and angiopoietin-4 are strikingly more structurally diverged from each other than are the mouse and human versions of angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2, they appear to represent the mouse and human counterparts of the same gene locus, as revealed in our chromosomal localization studies of all of the angiopoietins in mouse and human. The structural divergence of angiopoietin-3 and angiopoietin-4 appears to underlie diverging functions of these counterparts. Angiopoietin-3 and angiopoietin-4 have very different distributions in their respective species, and angiopoietin-3 appears to act as an antagonist, whereas angiopoietin-4 appears to function as an agonist.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1999
12006574,Angiotensin IV is a potent agonist for constitutive active human AT1 receptors. Distinct roles of the N-and C-terminal residues of angiotensin II during AT1 receptor activation.,"The octapeptide hormone, angiotensin II (Ang II), exerts its major physiological effects by activating AT(1) receptors. In vivo Ang II is degraded to bioactive peptides, including Ang III (angiotensin-(2-8)) and Ang IV (angiotensin-(3-8)). These peptides stimulate inositol phosphate generation in human AT(1) receptor expressing CHO-K1 cells, but the potency of Ang IV is very low. Substitution of Asn(111) with glycine, which is known to cause constitutive receptor activation by disrupting its interaction with the seventh transmembrane helix (TM VII), selectively increased the potency of Ang IV (900-fold) and angiotensin-(4-8), and leads to partial agonism of angiotensin-(5-8). Consistent with the need for the interaction between Arg(2) of Ang II and Ang III with Asp(281), substitution of this residue with alanine (D281A) decreased the peptide's potency without affecting that of Ang IV. All effects of the D281A mutation were superseded by the N111G mutation. The increased affinity of Ang IV to the N111G mutant was also demonstrated by binding studies. A model is proposed in which the Arg(2)-Asp(281) interaction causes a conformational change in TM VII of the receptor, which, similar to the N111G mutation, eliminates the constraining intramolecular interaction between Asn(111) and TM VII. The receptor adopts a more relaxed conformation, allowing the binding of the C-terminal five residues of Ang II that switches this ""preactivated"" receptor into the fully active conformation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
12829792,Angiotensin-(1-7) is an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor Mas.,"The renin-angiotensin system plays a critical role in blood pressure control and body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Besides angiotensin (Ang) II, other Ang peptides, such as Ang III [Ang-(2-8)], Ang IV [Ang-(3-8)], and Ang-(1-7) may also have important biological activities. Ang-(1-7) has become an angiotensin of interest in the past few years, because its cardiovascular and baroreflex actions counteract those of Ang II. Unique angiotensin-binding sites specific for this heptapeptide and studies with a selective Ang-(1-7) antagonist indicated the existence of a distinct Ang-(1-7) receptor. We demonstrate that genetic deletion of the G protein-coupled receptor encoded by the Mas protooncogene abolishes the binding of Ang-(1-7) to mouse kidneys. Accordingly, Mas-deficient mice completely lack the antidiuretic action of Ang-(1-7) after an acute water load. Ang-(1-7) binds to Mas-transfected cells and elicits arachidonic acid release. Furthermore, Mas-deficient aortas lose their Ang-(1-7)-induced relaxation response. Collectively, these findings identify Mas as a functional receptor for Ang-(1-7) and provide a clear molecular basis for the physiological actions of this biologically active peptide.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2003
26056041,ANGPTL2/LILRB2 signaling promotes the propagation of lung cancer cells.,"Immune inhibitory receptors expressed on various types of immune cells deliver inhibitory signals that maintain the homeostasis of the immune system. Recently we demonstrated that leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 2 (LILRB2) and its murine homolog, paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PIRB), are expressed on hematopoietic stem cells and acute myeloid leukemia stem cells and function in maintenance of stemness. Herein, we determined that both LILRB2 and its soluble ligand ANGPTL2 are highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples, and levels are adversely related to patient prognosis. Inhibition of LILRB2 expression in NSCLC cell lines, such as A549 cells, resulted in a dramatic decrease in proliferation, colony formation, and migration. Mechanistic analyses indicated that ANGPTL2 binds LILRB2 to support the growth of lung cancer cells and that the SHP2/CaMK1/CREB axis controls the proliferation of lung cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that signaling involving ANGPTL2 and LILRB2 is important for lung cancer development and represents a novel target for treatment of this type of cancer.",Oncotarget,2015
11877390,ANGPTL3 stimulates endothelial cell adhesion and migration via integrin alpha vbeta 3 and induces blood vessel formation in vivo.,"The angiopoietin family of secreted factors is functionally defined by the C-terminal fibrinogen (FBN)-like domain, which mediates binding to the Tie2 receptor and thereby facilitates a cascade of events ultimately regulating blood vessel formation. By screening expressed sequence tag data bases for homologies to a consensus FBN-like motive, we have identified ANGPTL3, a liver-specific, secreted factor consisting of an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and the C-terminal FBN-like domain. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments, however, failed to detect binding of ANGPTL3 to the Tie2 receptor. A molecular model of the FBN-like domain of ANGPTL3 was generated and predicted potential binding to integrins. This hypothesis was experimentally confirmed by the finding that recombinant ANGPTL3 bound to alpha(v)beta(3) and induced integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-dependent haptotactic endothelial cell adhesion and migration and stimulated signal transduction pathways characteristic for integrin activation, including phosphorylation of Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and focal adhesion kinase. When tested in the rat corneal assay, ANGPTL3 strongly induced angiogenesis with comparable magnitude as observed for vascular endothelial growth factor-A. Moreover, the C-terminal FBN-like domain alone was sufficient to induce endothelial cell adhesion and in vivo angiogenesis. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ANGPTL3 is the first member of the angiopoietin-like family of secreted factors binding to integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and suggest a possible role in the regulation of angiogenesis.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
16278303,Annexin 1 and its bioactive peptide inhibit neutrophil-endothelium interactions under flow: indication of distinct receptor involvement.,"We have tested the effects of annexin 1 (ANXA1) and its N-terminal peptide Ac2-26 on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) recruitment under flow. Differential effects of the full-length protein and its peptide were observed; ANXA1 inhibited firm adhesion of human PMNs, while Ac2-26 significantly attenuated capture and rolling without effect on firm adhesion. Analysis of the effects of ANXA1 and Ac2-26 on PMN adhesion molecule expression supported the flow chamber results, with Ac2-26 but not ANXA1 causing l-selectin and PSGL-1 shedding. ANXA1 and its peptide act via the FPR family of receptors. This was corroborated using HEK-293 cells transfected with FPR or FPRL-1/ALX (the 2 members of this family expressed by human PMNs). While Ac2-26 bound both FPR and FPRL-1/ALX, ANXA1 bound FPRL-1/ALX only. ANXA1 and Ac2-26 acted as genuine agonists; Ac2-26 binding led to ERK activation in both FPR- and FPRL-1/ALX-transfected cells, while ANXA1 caused ERK activation only in cells transfected with FPRL-1/ALX. Finally, blockade of FPRL-1/ALX with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody was found to abrogate the effects of ANXA1 in the flow chamber but was without effect on Ac2-26-mediated inhibition of rolling. These findings demonstrate for the first time distinct mechanisms of action for ANXA1 and its N-terminal peptide Ac2-26.",,
29786451,Annexin A2 is a Robo4 ligand that modulates ARF6 activation-associated cerebral trans-endothelial permeability.,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in neurological disorders remains an intractable problem with limited therapeutic options. Here, we investigate whether the endothelial cell membrane protein annexin A2 (ANXA2) may play a role in reducing trans-endothelial permeability and maintaining cerebrovascular integrity after injury. Compared with wild-type mice, the expression of cerebral endothelial junctional proteins was reduced in E15.5 and adult ANXA2 knockout mice, along with increased leakage of small molecule tracers. In human brain endothelial cells that were damaged by hypoxia plus IL-1β, treatment with recombinant ANXA2 (rA2) rescued the expression of junctional proteins and decreased trans-endothelial permeability. These protective effects were mediated in part by interactions with F-actin and VE-cadherin, and the ability of rA2 to modulate signaling via the roundabout guidance receptor 4 (Robo4)-paxillin-ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) pathway. Taken together, these observations suggest that ANXA2 may be associated with the maintenance of endothelial tightness after cerebrovascular injury. ANXA2-mediated pathways should be further explored as potential therapeutic targets for protecting the BBB in neurological disorders.",,
19965653,Annexin A2 tetramer activates human and murine macrophages through TLR4.,"Annexins are a large family of intracellular phospholipid-binding proteins, yet several extracellular roles have been identified. Specifically, annexin A2, found in a heterotetrameric complex with S100A10, not only serves as a key extracellular binding partner for pathogens and host proteins alike, but also can be shed or secreted. We reported previously that soluble annexin A2 tetramer (A2t) activates human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), resulting in secretion of inflammatory mediators and enhanced phagocytosis. Although a receptor for A2t has been cloned from bone marrow stromal cells, data contained in this study demonstrate that it is dispensable for A2t-dependent activation of MDM. Furthermore, A2t activates wild-type murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, whereas macrophages from myeloid differentiation factor 88-deficient mice display a blunted response, suggesting a role for Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Small interfering RNA knockdown of TLR4 in human MDM reduced the response to A2t, blocking antibodies against TLR4 (but not TLR2) blocked activation altogether, and bone marrow-derived macrophages from TLR4(-/-) mice were refractory to A2t. These data demonstrate that the modulation of macrophage function by A2t is mediated through TLR4, suggesting a previously unknown, but important role for this stress-sensitive protein in the detection of danger to the host, whether from injury or invasion.",Blood,2010

Ubiquitous expression of human AGRP complementary DNA in transgenic mice caused obesity without altering pigmentation. Thus, Agouti-related protein is a neuropeptide implicated in the normal control of body weight downstream of leptin signaling.",,
2176308,Antagonists for the neurokinin NK-3 receptor evaluated in selective receptor systems.,"Four isolated vessels that are monoreceptor systems for neurokinins, the dog carotid artery and rabbit jugular vein (NK-1), the rabbit pulmonary artery (NK-2) and the rat portal vein (NK-3), were used to compare the activities of selective neurokinin agonists and evaluate the affinities of new NK-3 antagonists. Chemical modifications in the partial sequences NKA (4-10) and NKB (4-10), particularly the replacement of Val7 with an aromatic residue (Tyr, MePhe or Trp) and the extension of the peptide backbone in position 8, obtained with beta-Ala, led to compounds that maintain weak agonistic activities on the NK-1 and NK-2, and some of them also on NK-3 receptors but exert potent antagonism against NKB on the NK-3 receptor of the rat portal vein. Antagonistic affinity is the highest when Trp is used in position 7 of [beta-Ala8]-NKA (4-10) and MePhe in position 7 of [beta-Ala8]-NKB (4-10). Antagonism is selective for NKB or [MePhe7]-NKB, and appears to be specific, since the most active compound [Trp7, beta-Ala8]-NKA (4-10) is inactive against bradykinin on the rabbit jugular vein (B2 receptor), against SP on the rabbit jugular vein (NK-1 receptor), against desArg9-bradykinin on the rabbit aorta (B1 receptor), and against angiotensin II and histamine (AT and H receptors, respectively) in the rabbit aorta. The new NK-3 receptor antagonists described in the present study provide useful tools for neurokinin receptor characterization and for determining the roles of neurokinins in physiopathology.",,
28893174,Antiproliferative factor (APF) binds specifically to sites within the cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4) extracellular domain.,"Antiproliferative factor (APF) is a sialoglycopeptide elevated in the urine of patients with interstitial cystitis-a chronic, painful bladder disease. APF inhibits the proliferation of normal bladder epithelial cells and cancer cells in vitro, presumably by binding to its cellular receptor, cytoskeleton associated-protein 4 (CKAP4); however, the biophysical interaction of APF with CKAP4 has not been characterized previously. In this study, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to explore the binding kinetics of the interaction of APF and as-APF (a desialylated APF analogue with full activity) to CKAP4.",,
18287027,Antisera induced by infusions of autologous Ad-CD154-leukemia B cells identify ROR1 as an oncofetal antigen and receptor for Wnt5a.,"We examined the sera of six patients before and after i.v. infusions of autologous chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells transduced ex vivo with an adenovirus encoding CD154 (Ad-CD154). Five patients made high-titer antibodies against adenovirus and three made IgG reactive with a leukemia-associated surface antigen, which we identified as ROR1. Anti-ROR1 antibodies were not detected in the sera of untreated patients. We generated anti-ROR1 mAbs and found they reacted specifically with the CLL cells of all patients, but not with nonleukemic leukocytes, a wide variety of normal adult tissues, or blood mononuclear cells, including CD5(+) B cells of healthy adults. ROR1 could bind Wnt5a, which induced activation of NF-kappaB when coexpressed with ROR1 in HEK293 cells and enhanced the survival of CLL cells in vitro, an effect that could be neutralized by posttreatment anti-ROR1 antisera. We conclude that patients with CLL can break immune tolerance to ROR1, which is an oncofetal surface antigen and survival-signaling receptor in this neoplastic disease.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2008
20393562,APCDD1 is a novel Wnt inhibitor mutated in hereditary hypotrichosis simplex.,"Hereditary hypotrichosis simplex is a rare autosomal dominant form of hair loss characterized by hair follicle miniaturization. Using genetic linkage analysis, we mapped a new locus for the disease to chromosome 18p11.22, and identified a mutation (Leu9Arg) in the adenomatosis polyposis down-regulated 1 (APCDD1) gene in three families. We show that APCDD1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that is abundantly expressed in human hair follicles, and can interact in vitro with WNT3A and LRP5-two essential components of Wnt signalling. Functional studies show that APCDD1 inhibits Wnt signalling in a cell-autonomous manner and functions upstream of beta-catenin. Moreover, APCDD1 represses activation of Wnt reporters and target genes, and inhibits the biological effects of Wnt signalling during both the generation of neurons from progenitors in the developing chick nervous system, and axis specification in Xenopus laevis embryos. The mutation Leu9Arg is located in the signal peptide of APCDD1, and perturbs its translational processing from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. APCDD1(L9R) probably functions in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit the stability and membrane localization of the wild-type protein. These findings describe a novel inhibitor of the Wnt signalling pathway with an essential role in human hair growth. As APCDD1 is expressed in a broad repertoire of cell types, our findings indicate that APCDD1 may regulate a diversity of biological processes controlled by Wnt signalling.",Nature,2010
9613612,APO2 ligand: a novel lethal weapon against malignant glioma?,"APO2L (TRAIL) is a novel CD95L (Fas/APO-1-L) homologous cytotoxic cytokine that interacts with various receptors which transmit (DR4, DR5) or inhibit (DcR1, DcR2) an apoptotic signal. Here, we report that human glioma cell lines preferentially express mRNAs for agonistic death receptors DR4 (8/12) and DR5 (11/12) rather than the death-inhibitory decoy receptors DcR1 (4/12) and DcR2 (2/12). Ten of 12 cell lines are susceptible to APO2L-induced apoptosis. The resistant cell lines, U138MG and U373MG, are cross-resistant to CD95L-induced apoptosis. Similar to CD95L-induced apoptosis, APO2L-induced apoptosis is inhibited by ectopic expression of the caspase inhibitor, crm-A, or of bcl-2, or by coexposure to the corticosteroid, dexamethasone, or the lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaretic acid. There is no correlation between p53 genetic status of the cell lines and their susceptibility to APO2L-induced apoptosis, but the latter is moderately enhanced by ectopic expression of wild-type p53. APO2L targeting may be a promising approach for selectively targeting apoptosis to human malignant glioma cells.",,

22622580,Apolipoprotein E controls cerebrovascular integrity via cyclophilin A.,"Human apolipoprotein E has three isoforms: APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4. APOE4 is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and is associated with Down's syndrome dementia and poor neurological outcome after traumatic brain injury and haemorrhage. Neurovascular dysfunction is present in normal APOE4 carriers and individuals with APOE4-associated disorders. In mice, lack of Apoe leads to blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, whereas APOE4 increases BBB susceptibility to injury. How APOE genotype affects brain microcirculation remains elusive. Using different APOE transgenic mice, including mice with ablation and/or inhibition of cyclophilin A (CypA), here we show that expression of APOE4 and lack of murine Apoe, but not APOE2 and APOE3, leads to BBB breakdown by activating a proinflammatory CypA-nuclear factor-κB-matrix-metalloproteinase-9 pathway in pericytes. This, in turn, leads to neuronal uptake of multiple blood-derived neurotoxic proteins, and microvascular and cerebral blood flow reductions. We show that the vascular defects in Apoe-deficient and APOE4-expressing mice precede neuronal dysfunction and can initiate neurodegenerative changes. Astrocyte-secreted APOE3, but not APOE4, suppressed the CypA-nuclear factor-κB-matrix-metalloproteinase-9 pathway in pericytes through a lipoprotein receptor. Our data suggest that CypA is a key target for treating APOE4-mediated neurovascular injury and the resulting neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.",Nature,2012
19225519,APP binds DR6 to trigger axon pruning and neuron death via distinct caspases.,"Naturally occurring axonal pruning and neuronal cell death help to sculpt neuronal connections during development, but their mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Here we report that beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21) activate a widespread caspase-dependent self-destruction program. DR6 is broadly expressed by developing neurons, and is required for normal cell body death and axonal pruning both in vivo and after trophic-factor deprivation in vitro. Unlike neuronal cell body apoptosis, which requires caspase 3, we show that axonal degeneration requires caspase 6, which is activated in a punctate pattern that parallels the pattern of axonal fragmentation. DR6 is activated locally by an inactive surface ligand(s) that is released in an active form after trophic-factor deprivation, and we identify APP as a DR6 ligand. Trophic-factor deprivation triggers the shedding of surface APP in a beta-secretase (BACE)-dependent manner. Loss- and gain-of-function studies support a model in which a cleaved amino-terminal fragment of APP (N-APP) binds DR6 and triggers degeneration. Genetic support is provided by a common neuromuscular junction phenotype in mutant mice. Our results indicate that APP and DR6 are components of a neuronal self-destruction pathway, and suggest that an extracellular fragment of APP, acting via DR6 and caspase 6, contributes to Alzheimer's disease.",,
10973284,APRIL and TALL-I and receptors BCMA and TACI: system for regulating humoral immunity.,"We report that the tumor neurosis factor homolog APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand) stimulates in vitro proliferation of primary B and T cells and increases spleen weight due to accumulation of B cells in vivo. APRIL functions via binding to BCMA (B cell maturation antigen) and TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML-interactor) and competes with TALL-I (also called BLyS or BAFF) for receptor binding. Soluble BCMA and TACI specifically prevent binding of APRIL and block APRIL-stimulated proliferation of primary B cells. BCMA-Fc also inhibits production of antibodies against keyhole limpet hemocyanin and Pneumovax in mice, indicating that APRIL and/or TALL-I signaling via BCMA and/or TACI are required for generation of humoral immunity. Thus, APRIL-TALL-I and BCMA-TACI form a two ligands-two receptors pathway involved in stimulation of B and T cell function.",Nature immunology,2000
10706119,"APRIL/TRDL-1, a tumor necrosis factor-like ligand, stimulates cell death.","We have examined the activity of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family identified through Expressed Sequence Tag database searching using TNFalpha protein as the search query. We have termed this protein TNF-related death ligand-la (TRDL-1alpha). Traditional cDNA library screening identified two additional splice variants designated TRDL-1beta and TRDL-1gamma that differed from TRDL-1alpha by the deletion of two small regions within the protein coding region. TRDL-1alpha is identical in sequence to the recently described molecule, APRIL, that may induce cell proliferation. We found, however, that purified, FLAG-tagged TRDL-1alpha caused Jurkat cell death with kinetics that paralleled FasL. In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that TRDL-1alpha coprecipitated Fas and HVEM and suggested TRDL-1alpha as an alternate ligand for these receptors. TRDL-1 localized to chromosome 17p13.3 and its expression was widespread in normal tissues. Examination of 48 tumor samples revealed high levels of TRDL-1 expression in several tumors, including those from the gastrointestinal tract. Expression of TRDL-1 in COS-1 cells confirmed membrane association of TRDL-1, typical of TNF family members.",,
10595537,Arginine 197 of the cholecystokinin-A receptor binding site interacts with the sulfate of the peptide agonist cholecystokinin.,"The knowledge of the binding sites of G protein-coupled cholecystokinin receptors represents important insights that may serve to understand their activation processes and to design or optimize ligands. Our aim was to identify the amino acid of the cholecystokinin-A receptor (CCK-AR) binding site in an interaction with the sulfate of CCK, which is crucial for CCK binding and activity. A three-dimensional model of the [CCK-AR-CCK] complex was built. In this model, Arg197 was the best candidate residue for a ionic interaction with the sulfate of CCK. Arg197 was exchanged for a methionine by site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type and mutated CCK-AR were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells for pharmacological and functional analysis. The mutated receptor on Arg197 did not bind the agonist radioligand 125I-BH-[Thr, Nle]-CCK-9; however, it bound the nonpeptide antagonist [3H]-SR27,897 as the wild-type receptor. The mutant was approximately 1,470- and 3,200-fold less potent than the wild-type CCK-AR to activate G proteins and to induce inositol phosphate production, respectively. This is consistent with the 500-fold lower potency and 800-fold lower affinity of nonsulfated CCK relative to sulfated CCK on the wild-type receptor. These data, together with those showing that the mutated receptor failed to discriminate nonsulfated and sulfated CCK while it retained other pharmacological features of the CCK-AR, strongly support an interaction between Arg197 of the CCK-AR binding site and the sulfate of CCK. In addition, the mutated CCK-AR resembled the low affinity state of the wild-type CCK-AR, suggesting that Arg197-sulfate interaction regulates conformational changes of the CCK-AR that are required for its physiological activation.",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,1999
10400673,Arginine 336 and asparagine 333 of the human cholecystokinin-A receptor binding site interact with the penultimate aspartic acid and the C-terminal amide of cholecystokinin.,"The cholecystokinin-A receptor (CCK-AR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates important central and peripheral cholecystokinin actions. Residues of the CCK-AR binding site that interact with the C-terminal part of CCK that is endowed with biological activity are still unknown. Here we report on the identification of Arg-336 and Asn-333 of CCK-AR, which interact with the Asp-8 carboxylate and the C-terminal amide of CCK-9, respectively. Identification of the two amino acids was achieved by dynamics-based docking of CCK in a refined three-dimensional model of CCK-AR using, as constraints, previous results that demonstrated that Trp-39/Gln-40 and Met-195/Arg-197 interact with the N terminus and the sulfated tyrosine of CCK, respectively. Arg-336-Asp-8 and Asn-333-amide interactions were pharmacologically assessed by mutational exchange of Arg-336 and Asn-333 in the receptor or reciprocal elimination of the partner chemical functions in CCK. This study also allowed us to demonstrate that (i) the identified interactions are crucial for stabilizing the high affinity phospholipase C-coupled state of the CCK-AR.CCK complex, (ii) Arg-336 and Asn-333 are directly involved in interactions with nonpeptide antagonists SR-27,897 and L-364,718, and (iii) Arg-336 but not Asn-333 is directly involved in the binding of the peptide antagonist JMV 179 and the peptide partial agonist JMV 180.

9299416,ART (protein product of agouti-related transcript) as an antagonist of MC-3 and MC-4 receptors.,"The mRNA encoding an agouti related protein (ART) of unknown biochemical function was previously reported to be up-regulated in the hypothalamus of two genetically obese mouse strains. We have expressed human ART as a secreted protein in COS-7 cells, and show that recombinant ART is functionally active in inhibiting the binding of a radiolabeled alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) analog to the human melanocortin-3 (MC-3) and melanocortin-4 (MC-4) receptors, while it is not a potent inhibitor of the human melanocortin-5 (MC-5) receptor. ART is an antagonist of the human MC-3 and MC-4 receptors as determined in functional assay. ART appears to be approximately 100-fold more potent than agouti with reference to the MC-3R and MC-4R binding affinity. These data suggest that ART may be a physiological regulator of feeding behavior.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1997
9883723,"Artemin, a novel member of the GDNF ligand family, supports peripheral and central neurons and signals through the GFRalpha3-RET receptor complex.","The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands (GDNF, Neurturin [NTN], and Persephin [PSP]) signal through a multicomponent receptor system composed of a high-affinity binding component (GFRalpha1-GFRalpha4) and a common signaling component (RET). Here, we report the identification of Artemin, a novel member of the GDNF family, and demonstrate that it is the ligand for the former orphan receptor GFRalpha3-RET. Artemin is a survival factor for sensory and sympathetic neurons in culture, and its expression pattern suggests that it also influences these neurons in vivo. Artemin can also activate the GFRalpha1-RET complex and supports the survival of dopaminergic midbrain neurons in culture, indicating that like GDNF (GFRalpha1-RET) and NTN (GFRalpha2-RET), Artemin has a preferred receptor (GFRalpha3-RET) but that alternative receptor interactions also occur.",,

1427896,Assignment of the genes encoding human interleukin-8 receptor types 1 and 2 and an interleukin-8 receptor pseudogene to chromosome 2q35.,"Two human cDNA clones that encode different interleukin-8 (IL8) receptors have recently been isolated. The interleukin-8 receptor type 1 (IL8R1) binds IL8 only, whereas the interleukin-8 receptor type 2 (IL8R2) (previously designated IL8RA) also binds growth regulated gene (GRO), and neutrophil activating protein-2 (NAP-2) with high affinity. In the process of screening a genomic library with these cDNAs to obtain large clones for use in chromosomal localization studies, we isolated an interleukin-8 receptor pseudogene (IL8RP) that bears greatest similarity to IL8R2. Using Southern hybridization analysis of human x rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs with cDNA probes for IL8R1 and IL8R2 and probes from the IL8RP locus, we assigned the three loci to chromosome 2; fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to metaphase chromosome preparations using genomic clones from each locus refined this localization to chromosome 2, band q35, for all three. By virtue of their chromosomal location, IL8R1 and IL8R2 may be considered candidate genes for several human disorders in which the involved locus has been mapped to distal 2q or that are associated with structural abnormalities of this segment, including van der Woude syndrome and the neoplastic diseases rhabdomyosarcoma and uterine leiomyomata. In addition, because this region of chromosome 2q is homologous to proximal mouse chromosome 1 in the segment containing the Lsh-Ity-Bcg locus involved in mediating host resistance to infection with intracellular pathogens, examination for abnormalities of the murine homologues of the IL8R genes should be considered in mice affected by mutations of this locus.",,
10187774,Assignment of transforming growth factor beta1 and beta3 and a third new ligand to the type I receptor ALK-1.,"Germ line mutations in one of two distinct genes, endoglin or ALK-1, cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant disorder of localized angiodysplasia. Both genes encode endothelial cell receptors for the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) ligand superfamily. Endoglin has homology to the type III receptor, betaglycan, although its exact role in TGF-beta signaling is unclear. Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1) has homology to the type I receptor family, but its ligand and corresponding type II receptor are unknown. In order to identify the ligand and type II receptor for ALK-1 and to investigate the role of endoglin in ALK-1 signaling, we devised a chimeric receptor signaling assay by exchanging the kinase domain of ALK-1 with either the TGF-beta type I receptor or the activin type IB receptor, both of which can activate an inducible PAI-1 promoter. We show that TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, as well as a third unknown ligand present in serum, can activate chimeric ALK-1. HHT-associated missense mutations in the ALK-1 extracellular domain abrogate signaling. The ALK-1/ligand interaction is mediated by the type II TGF-beta receptor for TGF-beta and most likely through the activin type II or type IIB receptors for the serum ligand. Endoglin is a bifunctional receptor partner since it can bind to ALK-1 as well as to type I TGF-beta receptor. These data suggest that HHT pathogenesis involves disruption of a complex network of positive and negative angiogenic factors, involving TGF-beta, a new unknown ligand, and their corresponding receptors.",,

1976256,Association of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 with the multichain high-affinity interleukin 2 receptor.,"Previously, using flow cytometric resonance energy transfer and lateral diffusion measurements, we demonstrated that a 95-kDa protein identified by two monoclonal antibodies (OKT27 and OKT27b) interacts physically with the 55-kDa alpha protein of the high-affinity interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor. In the present study, this 95-kDa protein (p95) was purified and amino acid sequence data were obtained that showed strong homology to the human intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). The identity of the p95 protein with ICAM-1 was confirmed by sequential immunoprecipitations using OKT27 and an antibody, WEHI-CAM-1, that is directed toward ICAM-1. We confirmed the physical proximity of p95/ICAM-1 to the IL-2 receptor alpha subunit by demonstrating that radiolabeled IL-2 could be cross-linked to this protein expressed on activated T cells. In functional studies, the antibodies OKT27 and OKT27b inhibited T-cell proliferative responses to OKT3, to soluble antigen, and to heterologous cells (mixed lymphocyte reaction). However, these antibodies did not inhibit IL-2-induced proliferation of an IL-2-dependent T-cell line. Taken together with our previous observations, the present studies suggest that ICAM-1 is in proximity and interacts physically with the high-affinity IL-2 receptor. The association of ICAM-1 with the IL-2 receptor may facilitate the paracrine IL-2-mediated stimulation of T cells expressing IL-2 receptors by augmenting homotypic T-T-cell interaction, by receptor-directed focusing of IL-2 release by helper T cells, and by focusing IL-2 receptors of the physically linked cells to the site of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1-ICAM-1-IL-2 receptor interaction.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1990
12975355,Association of TAG-1 with Caspr2 is essential for the molecular organization of juxtaparanodal regions of myelinated fibers.,"Myelination results in a highly segregated distribution of axonal membrane proteins at nodes of Ranvier. Here, we show the role in this process of TAG-1, a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol-anchored cell adhesion molecule. In the absence of TAG-1, axonal Caspr2 did not accumulate at juxtaparanodes, and the normal enrichment of shaker-type K+ channels in these regions was severely disrupted, in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In contrast, the localization of protein 4.1B, an axoplasmic partner of Caspr2, was only moderately altered. TAG-1, which is expressed in both neurons and glia, was able to associate in cis with Caspr2 and in trans with itself. Thus, a tripartite intercellular protein complex, comprised of these two proteins, appears critical for axo-glial contacts at juxtaparanodes. This complex is analogous to that described previously at paranodes, suggesting that similar molecules are crucial for different types of axo-glial interactions.",The Journal of cell biology,2003

11279101,Association of the membrane proximal regions of the alpha and beta subunit cytoplasmic domains constrains an integrin in the inactive state.,"The adhesiveness of integrins is regulated through a process termed ""inside-out"" signaling. To understand the molecular mechanism of integrin inside-out signaling, we generated K562 stable cell lines that expressed LFA-1 (alpha(L)beta(2)) or Mac-1 (alpha(M)beta(2)) with mutations in the cytoplasmic domain. Complete truncation of the beta(2) cytoplasmic domain, but not a truncation that retained the membrane proximal eight residues, resulted in constitutive activation of alpha(L)beta(2) and alpha(M)beta(2), demonstrating the importance of this membrane proximal region in the regulation of integrin adhesive function. Furthermore, replacement of the alpha(L) and beta(2) cytoplasmic domains with acidic and basic peptides that form an alpha-helical coiled coil caused inactivation of alpha(L)beta(2). Association of these artificial cytoplasmic domains was directly demonstrated. By contrast, replacement of the alpha(L) and beta(2) cytoplasmic domains with two basic peptides that do not form an alpha-helical coiled coil activated alpha(L)beta(2). Induction of ligand binding by the activating cytoplasmic domain mutations correlated with the induction of activation epitopes in the extracellular domain. Our data demonstrate that cytoplasmic, membrane proximal association between integrin alpha and beta subunits, constrains an integrin in the inactive conformation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
12383251,"Association of the thyrotropin receptor with calnexin, calreticulin and BiP. Efects on the maturation of the receptor.","The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. It has by now been clearly established that the maturation of the glycoproteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum involves interactions with molecular chaperones, which promote the folding and assembly of the glycoproteins. In this study, we investigated whether calnexin (CNX), calreticulin (CRT) and BiP, three of the main molecular chaperones present in the endoplasmic reticulum, interact with the TSHR and what effects these interactions might have on the folding of the receptor. In the first set of experiments, we observed that in a K562 cell line expressing TSHR, about 50% of the receptor synthesized was degraded by the proteasome after ubiquitination. In order to determine whether TSHR interact with CNX, CRT and BiP, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. TSHR was found to be associated with all three molecular chaperones. To study the role of the interactions between CNX and CRT and the TSHR, we used castanospermine, a glucosidase I and II inhibitor that blocks the interactions between these chaperones and glycoproteins. In K562 cells expressing the TSHR, these drugs led to a faster degradation of the receptor, which indicates that these interactions contribute to stabilizing the receptor after its synthesis. The overexpression of calnexin and calreticulin in these cells stabilizes the receptor during the first hour after its synthesis, whereas the degradation of TSHR increased in a cell line overexpressing BiP and the quantity of TSHR able to acquire complex type oligosaccharides decreased. These results show that calnexin, calreticulin and BiP all interact with TSHR and that the choice made between these two chaperone systems is crucial because each of them has distinct effects on the folding and stability of this receptor at the endoplasmic reticulum level.",,
10993080,AT1-receptor heterodimers show enhanced G-protein activation and altered receptor sequestration.,"The vasopressor angiotensin II regulates vascular contractility and blood pressure through binding to type 1 angiotensin II receptors (AT1; refs 1, 2). Bradykinin, a vasodepressor, is a functional antagonist of angiotensin II (ref. 3). The two hormone systems are interconnected by the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which releases angiotensin II from its precursor and inactivates the vasodepressor bradykinin. Here we show that the AT1 receptor and the bradykinin (B2) receptor also communicate directly with each other. They form stable heterodimers, causing increased activation of G alpha(q) and G alpha(i) proteins, the two major signalling proteins triggered by AT1. Furthermore, the endocytotic pathway of both receptors changed with heterodimerization. This is the first example of signal enhancement triggered by heterodimerization of two different vasoactive hormone receptors.",Nature,2000
9153189,"ATAR, a novel tumor necrosis factor receptor family member, signals through TRAF2 and TRAF5.","Members of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family signal largely through interactions with death domain proteins and TRAF proteins. Here we report the identification of a novel TNFR family member ATAR. Human and mouse ATAR contain 283 and 276 amino acids, respectively, making them the shortest known members of the TNFR superfamily. The receptor is expressed mainly in spleen, thymus, bone marrow, lung, and small intestine. The intracellular domains of human and mouse ATAR share only 25% identity, yet both interact with TRAF5 and TRAF2. This TRAF interaction domain resides at the C-terminal 20 amino acids. Like most other TRAF-interacting receptors, overexpression of ATAR activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Co-expression of ATAR with TRAF5, but not TRAF2, results in synergistic activation of NF-kappaB, suggesting potentially different roles for TRAF2 and TRAF5 in post-receptor signaling.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
25297873,"Atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2 mediates chemokine scavenging by primary human trophoblasts and can regulate fetal growth, placental structure, and neonatal mortality in mice.","Inflammatory chemokines produced in the placenta can direct the migration of placental leukocytes using chemokine receptors that decorate the surface of these cells. Fetal trophoblasts can also express receptors for inflammatory chemokines, and they are one of the few cell types that express atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2), previously known as D6. ACKR2 binds many inflammatory CC chemokines but cannot stimulate cell migration or activate signaling pathways used by conventional chemokine receptors. Existing evidence suggests that ACKR2 is a specialized chemokine scavenger, but its function in primary human trophoblasts has not been explored. In mice, ACKR2 is thought to be dispensable for the reproductive success of unchallenged females that have conceived naturally, but it can suppress inflammation-induced abortion and aid the survival of implanted allogeneic embryos. In this article, we demonstrate that cultured primary human trophoblasts express ACKR2 far more strongly than genes encoding conventional receptors for inflammatory CC chemokines. Moreover, these cells are capable of the rapid internalization and efficient scavenging of extracellular chemokine, and this is mediated by ACKR2. We also report that in unchallenged DBA/1j mice, Ackr2 deficiency increases the incidence of stillbirth and neonatal death, leads to structural defects in the placenta, and can decrease fetal weight.

Thus, primary human trophoblasts use ACKR2 to scavenge chemokines, and ACKR2 deficiency can cause abnormal placental structure and reduced neonatal survival.",,
26630010,Augmentor α and β (FAM150) are ligands of the receptor tyrosine kinases ALK and LTK: Hierarchy and specificity of ligand-receptor interactions.,"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a class of cell surface receptors that, upon ligand binding, stimulate a variety of critical cellular functions. The orphan receptor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is one of very few RTKs that remain without a firmly established protein ligand. Here we present a novel cytokine, FAM150B, which we propose naming augmentor-α (AUG-α), as a ligand for ALK. AUG-α binds ALK with high affinity and activates ALK in cells with subnanomolar potency. Detailed binding experiments using cells expressing ALK or the related receptor leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) demonstrate that AUG-α binds and robustly activates both ALK and LTK. We show that the previously established LTK ligand FAM150A (AUG-β) is specific for LTK and only weakly binds to ALK. Furthermore, expression of AUG-α stimulates transformation of NIH/3T3 cells expressing ALK, induces IL-3 independent growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing ALK, and is expressed in neuroblastoma, a cancer partly driven by ALK. These experiments reveal the hierarchy and specificity of two cytokines as ligands for ALK and LTK and set the stage for elucidating their roles in development and disease states.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2015

In an effort to understand these processes, we characterized transforming growth factor beta/BMP receptor and Smad expression in immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells and a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines. These studies prompted us to evaluate the potential role of BMP9 signaling in ovarian cancer. Using small interfering RNA, ligand trap, inhibitor, and ligand stimulation approaches, we show that BMP9 acts as a proliferative factor for immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells and ovarian cancer cell lines, signaling predominantly through an ALK2/Smad1/Smad4 pathway rather than through ALK1, the major BMP9 receptor in endothelial cells. Importantly, we find that some ovarian cancer cell lines have gained autocrine BMP9 signaling that is required for proliferation. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry analysis of an ovarian cancer tissue microarray reveals that approximately 25% of epithelial ovarian cancers express BMP9, whereas normal human ovarian surface epithelial specimens do not. Our data indicate that BMP9 signaling through ALK2 may be a novel therapeutic target in ovarian cancer.",Cancer research,2009

3001670,Autoradiographic distribution of 125I calcitonin gene-related peptide binding sites in the rat central nervous system.,"Using autoradiographic method and 125I-Tyro rat CGRP as a ligand, receptor binding sites were demonstrated in the rat central nervous system. Saturation studies and Scatchard analysis of CGRP-binding to slide mounted tissue sections containing primarily cerebellum showed a single class of receptors with a dissociation constant of 0.96 nM and a Bmax of 76.4 fmol/mg protein. 125I-Tyro rat CGRP binding sites were demonstrated throughout the rat central nervous system. Dense binding was observed in the telencephalon (medial prefrontal, insular and outer layers of the temporal cortex, nucleus accumbens, fundus striatum, central and inferior lateral amygdaloid nuclei, most caudal caudate putamen, organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, subfornical organ), the diencephalon (anterior hypothalamic, suprachiasmatic, arcuate, paraventricular, dorsomedial, periventricular, reuniens, rhomboid, lateral thalamic pretectalis and habenula nuclei, zona incerta), in the mesencephalon (superficial layers of the superior colliculus, central nucleus of the geniculate body, inferior colliculus, nucleus of the fifth nerve, locus coeruleus, nucleus of the mesencephalic tract, the dorsal tegmental nucleus, superior olive), in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, in the medulla oblongata (inferior olive, nucleus tractus solitarii, nucleus commissuralis, nuclei of the tenth and twelfth nerves, the prepositus hypoglossal and the gracilis nuclei, dorsomedial part of the spinal trigeminal tract), in the dorsal gray matter of the spinal cord (laminae I-VI) and the confines of the central canal. Moderate receptor densities were found in the septal area, the ""head"" of the anterior caudate nucleus, medial amygdaloid and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the pyramidal layers of the hippocampus and dentate gyri, medial preoptic area, ventromedial nucleus, lateral hypothalamic and ventrolateral thalamic area, central gray, reticular part of the substantia nigra, parvocellular reticular nucleus. Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract and gracile fasciculus of the spinal cord.

7854420,Axl receptor tyrosine kinase stimulated by the vitamin K-dependent protein encoded by growth-arrest-specific gene 6.,"The Axl receptor tyrosine kinase was identified as a protein encoded by a transforming gene from primary human myeloid leukaemia cells by DNA-mediated transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Axl is the founding member of a family of related receptors that includes Eyk, encoded by a chicken proto-oncogene originally described as a retroviral transforming gene, and c-Mer, encoded by a human proto-oncogene expressed in neoplastic B- and T-cell lines. The transforming activity of Axl demonstrates that the receptor can drive cellular proliferation. The function of Axl in non-transformed cells and tissues is unknown, but may involve the stimulation of cell proliferation in response to an appropriate signal, namely a ligand that activates the receptor. We report here the purification of an Axl stimulatory factor, and its identification as the product of growth-arrest-specific gene 6 (ref. 6). This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a ligand for the Axl family of receptors.",,

19155498,B and T lymphocyte attenuator regulates B cell receptor signaling by targeting Syk and BLNK.,"B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) functions as a negative regulator of T cell activation and proliferation. Although the role of BTLA in regulating T cell responses has been characterized, a thorough investigation into the precise molecular mechanisms involved in BTLA-mediated lymphocyte attenuation and, more specifically, its role in regulating B cell activation has not been presented. In this study, we have begun to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms by which BTLA functions to inhibit B cell activation. We describe the cell surface expression of BTLA on various human B cell subsets and confirm its ability to attenuate B cell proliferation upon associating with its known ligand, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM). BTLA associates with the BCR and, upon binding to HVEM, recruits the tyrosine phosphatase Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 and reduces activation of signaling molecules downstream of the BCR. This is exemplified by a quantifiable decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein tyrosine kinase Syk, as measured by absolute quantification mass spectrometry. Furthermore, effector molecules downstream of BCR signaling, including the B cell linker protein, phospholipase Cgamma2, and NF-kappaB, display decreased activation and nuclear translocation, respectively, after BTLA activation by HVEM. These results begin to provide insight into the mechanism by which BTLA negatively regulates B cell activation and indicates that BTLA is an inhibitory coreceptor of the BCR signaling pathway and attenuates B cell activation by targeting the downstream signaling molecules Syk and B cell linker protein.",,
15568026,B and T lymphocyte attenuator regulates T cell activation through interaction with herpesvirus entry mediator.,"B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) provides an inhibitory signal to B and T cells. Previously, indirect observations suggested that B7x was a ligand for BTLA. Here we show that BTLA does not bind B7x; instead, we identify herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) as the unique BTLA ligand. BTLA bound the most membrane-distal cysteine-rich domain of HVEM, distinct from regions where the ligands LIGHT and lymphotoxin-alpha bound HVEM. HVEM induced BTLA tyrosine phosphorylation and association of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and repressed antigen-driven T cell proliferation, providing an example of reverse signaling to a non-tumor necrosis factor family ligand. The conservation of the BTLA-HVEM interaction between mouse and human suggests that this system is an important pathway regulating lymphocyte activation and/or homeostasis in the immune response.",,
10908663,B cell maturation protein is a receptor for the tumor necrosis factor family member TALL-1.,"TALL-1 is a recently identified member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family that costimulates B lymphocyte proliferation. Here we show that B cell maturation protein (BCMA), a member of the TNF receptor family that is expressed only by B lymphocytes, specifically binds to TALL-1. A soluble receptor containing the extracellular domain of BCMA blocks the binding of TALL-1 to its receptor on the plasma membrane and inhibits TALL-1-triggered B lymphocyte costimulation. Overexpression of BCMA activates NF-kappaB, and this activation is potentiated by TALL-1. Moreover, BCMA-mediated NF-kappaB activation is inhibited by dominant negative mutants of TNF receptor-associated factor 5 (TRAF5), TRAF6, NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), and IkappaB kinase (IKK). These data indicate that BCMA is a receptor for TALL-1 and BCMA activates NF-kappaB through a TRAF5-, TRAF6-, NIK-, and IKK-dependent pathway. The identification of BCMA as a NF-kappaB-activating receptor for TALL-1 suggests molecular targets for drug development against certain immunodeficient or autoimmune diseases.",,
9463416,"B cell-attracting chemokine 1, a human CXC chemokine expressed in lymphoid tissues, selectively attracts B lymphocytes via BLR1/CXCR5.","Although most leukocytes, T lymphocytes in particular, respond to several different chemokines, there is virtually no information on chemokine activities and chemokine receptors in B lymphocytes. A putative chemokine receptor, BLR1, that is expressed in Burkitt's lymphoma cells and B lymphocytes was cloned a few years ago. Deletion of the gene for BLR1 yielded mice with abnormal primary follicles and germinal centers of the spleen and Peyer's patches, reflecting the inability of B lymphocytes to migrate into B cell areas. By screening expressed sequence tag DNA sequences, we have identified a CXC chemokine, termed B cell-attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1), that is chemotactic for human B lymphocytes. BCA-1 cDNA encodes a protein of 109 amino acids with a leader sequence of 22 residues. The mature protein shares 23-34% identical amino acids with known CXC chemokines and is constitutively expressed in secondary lymphoid organs. BCA-1 was chemically synthesized and tested for activity on murine pre-B cells 300-19 transfected with BLR1 and on human blood B lymphocytes. In transfected cells, BCA-1 induced chemotaxis and Ca2+ mobilization demonstrating that it acts via BLR1. Under the same conditions, no activity was obtained with 10 CXC and 19 CC chemokines, lymphotactin, neurotactin/fractalkine and several other peptide ligands. BCA-1 was also a highly effective attractant for human blood B lymphocytes (which express BLR1), but was inactive on freshly isolated or IL-2-stimulated T lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. In agreement with the nomenclature rules for chemokine receptors, we propose the term CXCR5 for BLR1. Together with the observed disturbance of B cell colonization in BLR1/ CXCR5-deficient mice, the present results indicate that chemotactic recruitment by locally produced BCA-1 is important for the development of B cell areas of secondary lymphoid tissues.",,
23954143,B7 family checkpoint regulators in immune regulation and disease.,"Fine-tuning the immune response and maintaining tolerance to self-antigens involves a complex network of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules. The recent FDA approval of ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody blocking cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4, demonstrates the impact of checkpoint regulators in disease. This is reinforced by ongoing clinical trials targeting not only CTLA-4, but also the programmed death (PD)-1 and B7-H4 pathways in various disease states. Recently, two new B7 family inhibitory ligands, V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) and B7-H6 were identified. Here, we review recent understanding of B7 family members and their concerted regulation of the immune response to either self or foreign pathogens. We also discuss clinical developments in targeting these pathways in different disease settings, and introduce VISTA as a putative therapeutic target.",,
21530327,B7-h2 is a costimulatory ligand for CD28 in human.,"CD28 and CTLA-4 are cell surface cosignaling molecules essential for the control of T cell activation upon the engagement of their ligands B7-1 and B7-2 from antigen-presenting cells. By employing a receptor array assay, we have demonstrated that B7-H2, best known as the ligand of inducible costimulator, was a ligand for CD28 and CTLA-4 in human, whereas these interactions were not conserved in mouse. B7-H2 and B7-1 or B7-2 interacted with CD28 through distinctive domains. B7-H2-CD28 interaction was essential for the costimulation of human T cells' primary responses to allogeneic antigens and memory recall responses. Similar to B7-1 and B7-2, B7-H2 costimulation via CD28 induced survival factor Bcl-xL, downregulated cell cycle inhibitor p27(kip1), and triggered signaling cascade of ERK and AKT kinase-dependent pathways. Our findings warrant re-evaluation of CD28 and CTLA-4's functions previously attributed exclusively to B7-1 and B7-2 and have important implications in therapeutic interventions against human diseases.",Immunity,2011

Recent studies have provided evidence for inhibitory functions of both members via PD-1. Meanwhile, compelling evidence exists for costimulatory function of both members. Here we demonstrate that expression of B7DC on the tumor cells promotes CD8 T cell-mediated rejection of tumor cells, at both the induction and effector phase of antitumor immunity. Moreover, B7DC binds to PD-1(-/-) cells and enhances T cell killing in a PD-1-independent mechanism. Our results demonstrate a novel pathway for B7DC to promote tumor immunity and may reconcile the apparently contradictory findings on the function of B7DC.",The Journal of experimental medicine,2003

Although BAFF is already known to bind two receptors, BCMA and TACI, we have identified a third receptor for BAFF that we have termed BAFF-R. BAFF-R binding appears to be highly specific for BAFF, suggesting a unique role for this ligand-receptor interaction. Consistent with this, the BAFF-R locus is disrupted in A/WySnJ mice, which display a B cell phenotype qualitatively similar to that of the BAFF-deficient mice. Thus, BAFF-R appears to be the principal receptor for BAFF-mediated mature B cell survival.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2001
21792931,Basigin interacts with both MCT1 and MCT2 in murine spermatozoa.,"Lactate is provided to spermatogenic cells by Sertoli cells as an energy substrate and its transport is regulated by H(+)-monocarboxylate co-transporters (MCTs). In the case of several cell types it is known that MCT1 is associated with basigin and MCT2 with embigin. Here we demonstrate co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation of basigin with both MCT1 and MCT2 in sperm, whereas no interaction with embigin was detectable. An investigation of the functional activity of MCT proteins revealed that it was mainly the application of L-lactate which resulted in a decrease in pH(i) . The pH(i) changes were blocked with α-cyano-4-OH cinnamate and the preference for L-lactate-as opposed to D-Lactate-was demonstrated by the determination of ATP after exposure to both lactate isomers. We propose that basigin interacts with MCT1 and MCT2 to locate them properly in the membrane of spermatogenic cells and that this may enable sperm to utilize lactate as an energy substrate contributing to cell survival.",Journal of cellular physiology,2012
11805102,beta 1-Integrin-mediated glioma cell adhesion and free radical-induced apoptosis are regulated by binding to a C-terminal domain of PG-M/versican.,"Integrins are cell-surface glycoproteins that mediate cell activities, including tissue morphogenesis, development, immune response, and cancer, through interaction with extracellular proteins. Here we report a novel means by which integrin signaling and functions are regulated. In pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation, beta(1)-integrin bound to the C-terminal domain of PG-M/versican, an extracellular chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. This was confirmed by cell-surface binding assays. Binding was calcium- and manganese-dependent. Upon native gel electrophoresis, beta(1)-integrin comigrated with the C-terminal domain of PG-M/versican. The interaction of beta(1)-integrin with the C-terminal domain of PG-M/versican activated focal adhesion kinase, enhanced integrin expression, and promoted cell adhesion. As a result, cells expressing the C-terminal domain of PG-M/versican were resistant to free radical-induced apoptosis. As the PG-M/versican peptide used in this study does not contain the RGD consensus-binding motif for integrins, the mechanism of the observed binding represents an entirely new function.",,
7542940,"Beta 8 integrins mediate interactions of chick sensory neurons with laminin-1, collagen IV, and fibronectin.","Integrins are major receptors used by cells to interact with extracellular matrices. In this paper, we identify the first ligands for the beta 8 family of integrins, presenting evidence that integrin heterodimers containing the beta 8 subunit mediate interactions of chick sensory neurons with laminin-1, collagen IV, and fibronectin. A polyclonal antibody, anti-beta 8-Ex, was prepared to a bacterial fusion protein expressing an extracellular portion of the chicken beta 8 subunit. In nonreducing conditions, this antibody immunoprecipitated from surface-labeled embryonic dorsal root ganglia neurons a M(r) 100 k protein, the expected M(r) of the beta 8 subunit, and putative alpha subunit(s) of M(r) 120 k. Affinity-purified anti-beta 8-Ex strongly inhibited sensory neurite outgrowth on laminin-1, collagen IV, and fibronectin-coated substrata. Binding sites were identified in a heat-resistant domain in laminin-1 and in the carboxyl terminal, 40-kDa fibronectin fragment. On substrates coated with the carboxyl terminal fragment of fibronectin, antibodies to beta 1 and beta 8 were only partially effective alone, but were completely effective in combination, at inhibiting neurite outgrowth. Results thus indicate that the integrin beta 8 subunit in association with one or more alpha subunits forms an important set of extracellular matrix receptors on sensory neurons.",Molecular biology of the cell,1995
10521347,Beta-defensins: linking innate and adaptive immunity through dendritic and T cell CCR6.,"Defensins contribute to host defense by disrupting the cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms. This report shows that human beta-defensins are also chemotactic for immature dendritic cells and memory T cells. Human beta-defensin was selectively chemotactic for cells stably transfected to express human CCR6, a chemokine receptor preferentially expressed by immature dendritic cells and memory T cells. The beta-defensin-induced chemotaxis was sensitive to pertussis toxin and inhibited by antibodies to CCR6. The binding of iodinated LARC, the chemokine ligand for CCR6, to CCR6-transfected cells was competitively displaced by beta-defensin. Thus, beta-defensins may promote adaptive immune responses by recruiting dendritic and T cells to the site of microbial invasion through interaction with CCR6.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1999
9528863,Betacellulin-Pseudomonas toxin fusion proteins bind but are not cytotoxic to cells expressing HER4; correlation of EGFR for cytotoxic activity.,"Betacellulin (BTC) is a member of the EGF ligand family that directly binds to both EGFR and HER4 and induces the growth of certain epithelial cell types. Fusion proteins composed of the terminal 48 or 50 amino acids of mature betacellulin and a binding defective form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (BTC-TX48 and BTC-TX50, respectively), have been produced. BTC-TX50 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both EGFR and HER4, whereas BTC-TX48 induced phosphorylation of HER4 but to a much lesser extent EGFR, indicating that the presence of two additional amino acid residues, Arg62 and Lys63, contribute to full kinase activity. BTC-TX50 was up to 300-fold more active at inhibiting protein synthesis than BTC-TX48 on cell lines expressing EGFR, most likely due to the >tenfold higher affinity of BTC-TX50. MDA-MB-453 breast carcinoma cells which express HER4 but not EGFR, were not sensitive to either BTC-TX form. These data indicate that despite the ability of BTC-TX to bind and phosphorylate HER4, it was only cytotoxic to cells expressing EGFR. The inability of BTC-TX to kill cells was likely due to its failure to internalize through HER4.",,
10746731,Betaglycan binds inhibin and can mediate functional antagonism of activin signalling.,"Activins and inhibins, structurally related members of the TGF-beta superfamily of growth and differentiation factors, are mutually antagonistic regulators of reproductive and other functions. Activins bind specific type II receptor serine kinases (ActRII or IIB) to promote the recruitment and phosphorylation of the type I receptor serine kinase, ALK4 (refs 7-9), which then regulates gene expression by activating Smad proteins. Inhibins also bind type II activin receptors but do not recruit ALK4, providing a competitive model for the antagonism of activin by inhibin. Inhibins fail to antagonize activin in some tissues and cells, however, suggesting that additional components are required for inhibin action. Here we show that the type III TGF-beta receptor, betaglycan, can function as an inhibin co-receptor with ActRII. Betaglycan binds inhibin with high affinity and enhances binding in cells co-expressing ActRII and betaglycan. Inhibin also forms crosslinked complexes with both recombinant and endogenously expressed betaglycan and ActRII. Finally, betaglycan confers inhibin sensitivity to cell lines that otherwise respond poorly to this hormone. The ability of betaglycan to facilitate inhibin antagonism of activin provides a variation on the emerging roles of proteoglycans as co-receptors modulating ligand-receptor sensitivity, selectivity and function.",Nature,2000
8106553,Betaglycan can act as a dual modulator of TGF-beta access to signaling receptors: mapping of ligand binding and GAG attachment sites.,"Betaglycan, also known as the TGF-beta type III receptor, is a membrane-anchored proteoglycan that presents TGF-beta to the type II signaling receptor, a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase. The betaglycan extracellular region, which can be shed by cells into the medium, contains a NH2-terminal domain related to endoglin and a COOH-terminal domain related to uromodulin, sperm receptors Zp2 and 3, and pancreatic secretory granule GP-2 protein. We identified residues Ser535 and Ser546 in the uromodulin-related region as the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment sites. Their mutation to alanine prevents GAG attachment but does not interfere with betaglycan stability or ability to bind and present TGF-beta to receptor II. Using a panel of deletion mutants, we found that TGF-beta binds to the NH2-terminal endoglin-related region of betaglycan. The remainder of the extracellular domain and the cytoplasmic domain are not required for presentation of TGF-beta to receptor II; however, membrane anchorage is required. Soluble betaglycan can bind TGF-beta but does not enhance binding to membrane receptors. In fact, recombinant soluble betaglycan acts as potent inhibitor of TGF-beta binding to membrane receptors and blocks TGF-beta action, this effect being particularly pronounced with the TGF-beta 2 isoform. The results suggest that release of betaglycan into the medium converts this enhancer of TGF-beta action into a TGF-beta antagonist.",The Journal of cell biology,1994
8878483,Bidirectional signalling through the EPH-family receptor Nuk and its transmembrane ligands.,"Receptor tyrosine kinases of the EPH class have been implicated in the control of axon guidance and fasciculation, in regulating cell migration, and in defining compartments in the developing embryo. Efficient activation of EPH receptors generally requires that their ligands be anchored to the cell surface, either through a transmembrane (TM) region or a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) group. These observations have suggested that EPH receptors can transduce signals initiated by direct cell-cell interaction. Genetic analysis of Nuk, a murine EPH receptor that binds TM ligands, has raised the possibility that these ligands might themselves have a signalling function. Consistent with this, the three known TM ligands have a highly conserved cytoplasmic region, with multiple potential sites for tyrosine phosphorylation. Here we show that challenging cells that express the TM ligands Elk-L or Htk-L with the clustered ectodomain of Nuk induces phosphorylation of the ligands on tyrosine, a process that can be mimicked both in vitro and in vivo by an activated Src tyrosine kinase. Co-culture of cells expressing a TM ligand with cells expressing Nuk leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of both the ligand and Nuk. These results suggest that the TM ligands are associated with a tyrosine kinase, and are inducibly phosphorylated upon binding Nuk, in a fashion reminiscent of cytokine receptors. Furthermore, we show that TM ligands, as well as Nuk, are phosphorylated on tyrosine in mouse embryos, indicating that this is a physiological process. EPH receptors and their TM ligands therefore mediate bidirectional cell signalling.",,
25260943,Biglycan is a novel binding partner of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3c (FGFR3c) in the human testis.,"Regulation of spermatogonial maintenance in the human testis is currently not well understood. One pathway suggested to be involved is activated by fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), which is expressed in a subset of spermatogonia. FGFR3-activating mutations have been identified in spermatocytic seminoma, thought to originate from clonal expansion of spermatogonia. In this study we aimed to characterize potential binding partners of FGFR3, and specifically its mesenchymal ""c"" splice isoform, in human spermatogonia. Based on expression patterns and homology to the binding site, we identified FGF1, FGF2, and FGF9 as the best candidates for natural ligands of FGFR3c in the testis. In addition, we screened non-FGF proteins and found that a proteoglycan biglycan (BGN) contains a sequence homologous to the FGFR3c binding site on FGF1, and is expressed in peritubular cells adjacent to FGFR3-expressing spermatogonia. Experiments in a cell-free system confirmed that BGN binds to FGFR3c and FGF1. In conclusion, our findings further clarify the complex regulation of FGFR3c in the human testis. We postulate that BGN is a factor secreted by peritubular cells to modulate FGFR3c signaling and thus contributes to the regulation of spermatogonial maintenance.",,
18037996,Bile salt-dependent lipase interacts with platelet CXCR4 and modulates thrombus formation in mice and humans.,"Bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL) is an enzyme involved in the duodenal hydrolysis and absorption of cholesteryl esters. Although some BSDL is transported to blood, the role of circulating BSDL is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that BSDL is stored in platelets and released upon platelet activation. Because BSDL contains a region that is structurally homologous to the V3 loop of HIV-1, which binds to CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), we hypothesized that BSDL might bind to CXCR4 present on platelets. In human platelets in vitro, both BSDL and a peptide corresponding to its V3-like loop induced calcium mobilization and enhanced thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation, spreading, and activated alpha(IIb)beta(3) levels. These effects were abolished by CXCR4 inhibition. BSDL also increased the production of prostacyclin by human endothelial cells. In a mouse thrombosis model, BSDL accumulated at sites of vessel wall injury. When CXCR4 was antagonized, the accumulation of BSDL was inhibited and thrombus size was reduced. In BSDL(-/-) mice, calcium mobilization in platelets and thrombus formation were attenuated and tail bleeding times were increased in comparison with those of wild-type mice. We conclude that BSDL plays a role in optimal platelet activation and thrombus formation by interacting with CXCR4 on platelets.",,
21856167,Binding and activity of all human alpha interferon subtypes.,"Vertebrates have multiple genes encoding Type I interferons (IFN), for reasons that are not fully understood. The Type I IFN appear to bind to the same heterodimeric receptor and the subtypes have been shown to have different potencies in various experimental systems. To put this concept on a quantitative basis, we have determined the binding affinities and rate constants of 12 human Alpha-IFN subtypes to isolated interferon receptor chains 1 and 2. Alpha-IFNs bind IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 at affinities of 0.5-5 μM and 0.4-5 nM respectively (except for IFN-alpha1 - 220 nM). Additionally we have examined the biological activity of these molecules in several antiviral and antiproliferative models. Particularly for antiproliferative potency, the binding affinity and activity correlate. However, the EC50 values differ significantly (1.5 nM versus 0.1 nM for IFN-alpha2 in WISH versus OVCAR cells). For antiviral potency, there are several instances where the relationship appears to be more complicated than simple binding. These results will serve as a point of reference for further understanding of this multiple ligand/receptor system.",Cytokine,2011
9660793,Binding and functional properties of recombinant and endogenous CXCR3 chemokine receptors.,"IP10 and MIG are two members of the CXC branch of the chemokine superfamily whose expression is dramatically up-regulated by interferon (IFN)-gamma. The proteins act largely on natural killer (NK)-cells and activated T-cells and have been implicated in mediating some of the effects of IFN-gamma and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), as well as T-cell-dependent anti-tumor responses. Recently both chemokines have been shown to be functional agonists of the same G-protein-coupled receptor, CXCR3. We now report the pharmacological characterization of CXCR3 and find that, when heterologously expressed, CXCR3 binds IP10 and MIG with Ki values of 0.14 and 4.9 nM, respectively. The receptor has very modest affinity for SDF-1alpha and little or no affinity for other CXC-chemokines. The properties of the endogenous receptor expressed on activated T-cells are similar. Surprisingly, several CC-chemokines, particularly eotaxin and MCP-4, also compete with moderate affinity for the binding of IP10 to CXCR3. Eotaxin does not activate CXCR3 but, in CXCR3-transfected cells, can block IP10-mediated receptor activation. Eotaxin, therefore, may be a natural CXCR3 antagonist.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
9565587,Binding interaction of the heregulinbeta egf domain with ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors assessed by alanine scanning mutagenesis.,"Individual residues of the heregulinbeta (HRG) egf domain were mutated to alanine and displayed monovalently on phagemid particles as gene III fusion proteins. Wild type HRGbeta egf domain displayed on phage was properly folded as evidenced by its ability to bind ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptor-IgG fusion proteins with affinities close to those measured for bacterially produced HRGbeta egf domain. Binding to ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors was affected by mutation of residues throughout the egf domain; including the NH2 terminus (His2 and Leu3), the two beta-turns (Val15-Gly18 and Gly42-Gln46), and some discontinuous residues (including Leu3, Val4, Phe13, Val23, and Leu33) that form a patch on the major beta-sheet and the COOH-terminal region (Tyr48 and Met50-Phe53). Binding affinity was least changed by mutations throughout the Omega-loop and the second strand of the major beta-sheet. More mutants had greater affinity loss for ErbB3 compared with ErbB4 implying that it has more stringent binding requirements. Many residues important for HRG binding to its receptors correspond to critical residues for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha binding to the EGF receptor. Specificity may be determined in part by bulky groups that prevent binding to the unwanted receptor. All of the mutants tested were able to induce phosphorylation and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation through ErbB4 receptors and were able to modulate a transphosphorylation signal from ErbB3 to ErbB2 in MCF7 cells. An understanding of binding similarities and differences among the EGF family of ligands may facilitate the development of egf-like analogs with broad or narrow specificity.",,
7721873,"Binding interactions of human interleukin 5 with its receptor alpha subunit. Large scale production, structural, and functional studies of Drosophila-expressed recombinant proteins.","Human interleukin 5 (hIL5) and soluble forms of its receptor alpha subunit were expressed in Drosophila cells and purified to homogeneity, allowing a detailed structural and functional analysis. B cell proliferation confirmed that the hIL5 was biologically active. Deglycosylated hIL5 remained active, while similarly deglycosylated receptor alpha subunit lost activity. The crystal structure of the deglycosylated hIL5 was determined to 2.6-A resolution and found to be similar to that of the protein produced in Escherichia coli. Human IL5 was shown by analytical ultracentrifugation to form a 1:1 complex with the soluble domain of the hIL5 receptor alpha subunit (shIL5R alpha). Additionally, the relative abundance of ligand and receptor in the hIL5.shIL5R alpha complex was determined to be 1:1 by both titration calorimetry and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of dissolved cocrystals of the complex. Titration microcalorimetry yielded equilibrium dissociation constants of 3.1 and 2.0 nM, respectively, for the binding of hIL5 to shIL5R alpha and to a chimeric form of the receptor containing shIL5R alpha fused to the immunoglobulin Fc domain (shIL5R alpha-Fc). Analysis of the binding thermodynamics of IL5 and its soluble receptor indicates that conformational changes are coupled to the binding reaction. Kinetic analysis using surface plasmon resonance yielded data consistent with the Kd values from calorimetry and also with the possibility of conformational isomerization in the interaction of hIL5 with the receptor alpha subunit. Using a radioligand binding assay, the affinity of hIL5 with full-length hIL5R alpha in Drosophila membranes was found to be 6 nM, in accord with the affinities measured for the soluble receptor forms. Hence, most of the binding energy of the alpha receptor is supplied by the soluble domain. Taken with other aspects of hIL5 structure and biological activity, the data obtained allow a prediction for how 1:1 stoichiometry and conformational change can lead to the formation of hIL5.receptor alpha beta complex and signal transduction.",,
8627290,Binding interactions of leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor with the different subunits of their high affinity receptors.,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) share common components in their multimeric receptors. Both cytokine receptors contain gp130/interleukin-6-receptor transducer as well as gp190/low affinity LIF receptor. For CNTF, addition of a third subunit, or alpha subunit, defines the high-affinity CNTF receptor. In the present study, we analyzed the binding interactions of LIF and CNTF in human cell lines and showed a mutual displacement for LIF and CNTF toward the trimeric high-affinity CNTF receptor. Similar results were obtained in the JEG cell line, which only expressed the gp130/gp190 high-affinity LIF receptor, by adding a soluble form of the alpha CNTF receptor to the system to reconstitute the high-affinity-type CNTF receptor. The different receptor subunits were then expressed separately in transfected cells and their binding capacities analyzed. The results showed that the heterocomplex CNTF/alpha CNTF receptor bound to gp130 with an affinity of 3-5 x 10(-10)M, whereas LIF interacted mainly with gp190. In summary, the observed competition between LIF and CNTF does not result from the binding to a common site or receptor subunit, but rather to the interaction of the three receptor components to create a conformational site common to both LIF and CNTF.",Journal of neurochemistry,1996
11314756,Binding of 125I-labeled ghrelin to membranes from human hypothalamus and pituitary gland.,"Ghrelin has been proposed as a natural ligand of the GH secretagogue receptor(s) (GHS-R), which was an orphan receptor activated by synthetic peptidyl (hexarelin) and non-peptidyl (MK-0677) GHS to strongly release GH in animals and humans. Herein we studied: 1) the binding of 125I-labeled human ghrelin to membranes from human hypothalamus and pituitary gland; 2) the ability of human ghrelin (either octanoylated or desoctanoylated), as well as of some GHS and neuropeptides to compete with the radioligand. The saturation binding analysis showed, in both tissues, the existence of a single class of high-affinity binding sites with limited binding capacity. The Bmax (maximal number of binding sites) values of ghrelin receptors in the hypothalamus were significantly greater (p<0.001) than those detected in the pituitary, whereas the Kd (dissociation constant) values in the two tissues were similar. 125I-ghrelin bound to hypothalamic membranes was displaced by ghrelin, hexarelin, MK-0677, various GHS antagonists (EP-80317, [D-Arg1-D-Phe5-D-Trp7,9-Leu11]-substance P) and some natural (cortistatin-14) and synthetic (vapreotide) SRIH-14 agonists. In contrast, no competition was seen in the presence of GHRH-44, SRIH-14 or desoctanoylated ghrelin, a ghrelin precursor that is devoid of GH-releasing properties. In conclusion, this preliminary study firstly demonstrates that ghrelin needs octanoylation to bind its hypothalamo-pituitary receptors. These receptors are the specific binding sites for GHS and their antagonists, as well as for SRIH analogs (vapreotide and cortistatin- 14), but not for native SRIH.",,
10950950,"Binding of a large chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, versican, to L-selectin, P-selectin, and CD44.","Here we show that a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, versican, derived from a renal adenocarcinoma cell line ACHN, binds L-selectin, P-selectin, and CD44. The binding was mediated by the interaction of the chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain of versican with the carbohydrate-binding domain of L- and P-selectin and CD44. The binding of versican to L- and P-selectin was inhibited by CS B, CS E, and heparan sulfate (HS) but not by any other glycosaminoglycans tested. On the other hand, the binding to CD44 was inhibited by hyaluronic acid, chondroitin (CH), CS A, CS B, CS C, CS D, and CS E but not by HS or keratan sulfate. A cross-blocking study indicated that L- and P-selectin recognize close or overlapping sites on versican, whereas CD44 recognizes separate sites. We also show that soluble L- and P-selectin directly bind to immobilized CS B, CS E, and HS and that soluble CD44 directly binds to immobilized hyaluronic acid, CH, and all the CS chains examined. Consistent with these results, structural analysis showed that versican is modified with at least CS B and CS C. Thus, proteoglycans sufficiently modified with the appropriate glycosaminoglycans should be able to bind L-selectin, P-selectin, and/or CD44.",,
10958687,"Binding of Delta1, Jagged1, and Jagged2 to Notch2 rapidly induces cleavage, nuclear translocation, and hyperphosphorylation of Notch2.","Delta1, Jagged1, and Jagged2, commonly designated Delta/Serrate/LAG-2 (DSL) proteins, are known to be ligands for Notch1. However, it has been less understood whether they are ligands for Notch receptors other than Notch1. Meanwhile, ligand-induced cleavage and nuclear translocation of the Notch protein are considered to be fundamental for Notch signaling, yet direct observation of the behavior of the Notch molecule after ligand binding, including cleavage and nuclear translocation, has been lacking. In this report, we investigated these issues for Notch2. All of the three DSL proteins bound to endogenous Notch2 on the surface of BaF3 cells, although characteristics of Jagged2 for binding to Notch2 apparently differed from that of Delta1 and Jagged1. After binding, the three DSL proteins induced cleavage of the membrane-spanning subunit of Notch2 (Notch2(TM)), which occurred within 15 min. In a simultaneous time course, the cleaved fragment of Notch2(TM) was translocated into the nucleus. Interestingly, the cleaved Notch2 fragment was hyperphosphorylated also in a time-dependent manner. Finally, binding of DSL proteins to Notch2 also activated the transcription of reporter genes driven by the RBP-Jkappa-responsive promoter. Together, these data indicate that all of these DSL proteins function as ligands for Notch2. Moreover, the findings of rapid cleavage, nuclear translocation, and phosphorylation of Notch2 after ligand binding facilitate the understanding of the Notch signaling.",Molecular and cellular biology,2000
14983046,Binding of F-spondin to amyloid-beta precursor protein: a candidate amyloid-beta precursor protein ligand that modulates amyloid-beta precursor protein cleavage.,"Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), a type I membrane protein, is physiologically processed by alpha- or beta-secretases that cleave APP N-terminal to the transmembrane region. Extracellular alpha-/beta-cleavage of APP generates a large secreted N-terminal fragment, and a smaller cellular C-terminal fragment. Subsequent gamma-secretase cleavage in the transmembrane region of the C-terminal fragment induces secretion of small extracellular peptides, including Abeta40 and Abeta42, which are instrumental in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and intracellular release of a cytoplasmic tail fragment. Although APP resembles a cell-surface receptor, no functionally active extracellular ligand for APP that might regulate its proteolytic processing has been described. We now show that F-spondin, a secreted signaling molecule implicated in neuronal development and repair, binds to the conserved central extracellular domain of APP and inhibits beta-secretase cleavage of APP. Our data indicate that F-spondin may be an endogenous regulator of APP cleavage, and suggest that the extracellular domains of APP are potential drug targets for interfering with beta-secretase cleavage.",,
10829012,Binding of GDNF and neurturin to human GDNF family receptor alpha 1 and 2. Influence of cRET and cooperative interactions.,"The members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family signal via binding to the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane proteins, the GDNF family receptors alpha (GFRalpha), and activation of cRET. We performed a detailed analysis of the binding of GDNF and neurturin to their receptors and investigated the influence of cRET on the binding affinities. We show that the rate of dissociation of (125)I-GDNF from GFRalpha1 is increased in the presence of 50 nm GDNF, an effect that can be explained by the occurrence of negative cooperativity. Scatchard plots of the ligand concentration binding isotherms reveal a pronounced downward curvature at low (125)I-GDNF concentrations suggesting the presence of positive cooperativity. This effect is observed in the range of GDNF concentrations responsible for biological activity (1-20 pm) and may have an important role in cRET-independent signaling. A high affinity site with a K(D) of 11 pm for (125)I-GDNF is detected only when GFRalpha1 is co-expressed with cRET at a DNA ratio of 1:3. These results suggest an interaction of GFRalpha1 and cRET in the absence of GDNF and demonstrate that the high affinity binding can be measured only when cRET is present.",,
9921412,Binding of HIV-1 to RBCs involves the Duffy antigen receptors for chemokines (DARC).,"The Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) belongs to a family of erythrocyte chemokine receptors that bind C-X-C and C-C chemokines such as interleukin 8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and regulated-on-activation, normal T cell-expressed and -secreted (RANTES), but not macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) or MIP-1 beta. DARC has also been identified to a receptor for malaria parasites Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi. In the present study, we show that HIV-1 binds to RBCs from Caucasian individuals via DARC making RBCs able to transmit HIV to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Furthermore, binding of HIV-1 particles to RBCs is inhibited by treating these cells with recombinant RANTES, but not with recombinant MIP-1 alpha prior to their incubation with HIV-1. This finding suggests that RBCs may function as a reservoir for HIV-1 or as a receptor for the entry of HIV-1 into CD4-cell subsets as well as neurons or endothelial cells.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,1998
1955498,Binding of human growth hormone (GH)-variant (placental GH) to GH-binding proteins in human plasma.,"Human GH-variant (hGH-V) is a natural GH analog arising from the hGH-V gene. It is expressed in the placenta and secreted into the maternal circulation during the second half of pregnancy. To gain information about its bioactivity in man, we examined the interaction of hGH-V with the high affinity GH-binding protein/receptor (GH-BP) in human plasma. hGH-V was equipotent with pituitary hGH (hGH-N) as a ligand for the GH-BP. hGH-N/hGH-V chimeric proteins, where the sequences encoded by exon 3 (amino acid residues 32-71, thought to be exposed on the molecule's surface and involved in receptor binding) were exchanged, also bound with similarly high affinities. A corresponding hGH-N/rat PRL chimeric protein had 25-fold reduced affinity for the GH-BP. We conclude that hGH-V is a potent somatogen in man, and that some of the manifestations of late pregnancy, such as increased insulin-like growth factor-I levels and coarsening of features, are probably related to the high circulating levels of hGH-V. GH-BP measurements in pregnancy must take into account BP saturation by endogenous hGH-V.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,1991
7592681,Binding of Neu differentiation factor with the extracellular domain of Her2 and Her3.,"The interaction of neu differentiation factor (NDF) with the extracellular domains of Her2 (sHer2) and Her3 (sHer3) have been studied using native gels, light scattering, and sedimentation equilibrium. The full-length NDF beta 2 was shown to bind sHer3 with a dissociation constant of 26 +/- 9 nM, while it showed a 1000-fold weaker binding to sHer2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that NDF is a high affinity ligand for Her3, but not for Her2. No increase in affinity of the NDF beta 2 for sHer3 was observed upon addition of sHer2 to the NDF beta 2-sHer3 mixture. Binding of NDF beta 2 to sHer3 did not induce receptor dimerization or oligomerization, the stoichiometry being one sHer3 per one NDF molecule. This finding suggests that transmembrane and/or intracellular domains of receptor family members or perhaps additional unidentified components may be involved in NDF induced dimerization and autophosphorylation, or alternatively, that dimerization is not the mechanism for Her3 autophosphorylation and signal transduction.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1995
8621424,"Binding of neurotrophin-3 to p75LNGFR, TrkA, and TrkB mediated by a single functional epitope distinct from that recognized by trkC.","Neurotrophins regulate differentiation and survival of vertebrate neurons through binding to members of the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases and to a common low affinity receptor, p75LNGFR. The specificity of neurotrophin action is determined by their selective interaction with the different members of the Trk family; TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC serve as cognate receptors for nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), respectively. Unlike nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT-3 can to some extent also bind and activate non-cognate TrkA and B receptors, although the physiological relevance of these interactions is unclear. Previous studies established that neurotrophins use an extended surface for binding to cognate Trk receptors, while binding to p75LNGFR is mediated by a localized cluster of positively charged residues. Here we show that the binding site of NT-3 to its non-preferred receptors TrkA and TrkB is dominated by two positively charged residues, Arg-31 and His-33, previously shown to constitute a main determinant of binding to p75LNGFR. Simultaneous mutation of these two residues into Ala completely abolished NT-3 binding and signaling through TrkA and greatly diminished binding and activation of TrkB. However, NT-3 binding and signaling through its cognate receptor TrkC was unaffected by the mutation. These results show that binding of NT-3 to p75LNGFR, TrkA, and TrkB is mediated by a common determinant, which is distinct from that recognized by TrkC and also different and more localized than the one recognized by TrkA and TrkB in their cognate ligands. Thus, although homologous regions in all neurotrophins are used for binding to Trk receptors, a given Trk may actually contact different residues in different neurotrophins. The mutant NT-3 described here may be of greater advantage than native NT-3 when a trophic activity needs to be specifically targeted to TrkC-expressing neurons and provides a monospecific neurotrophin for future therapeutic development.",,
17452316,Binding of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 to epidermal growth factor-like repeat A of low density lipoprotein receptor decreases receptor recycling and increases degradation.,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes degradation of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR), the major route of clearance of circulating cholesterol. Gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 cause hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerosis, whereas loss-of-function mutations result in hypocholesterolemia and protection from heart disease. Recombinant human PCSK9 binds the LDLR on the surface of cultured hepatocytes and promotes degradation of the receptor after internalization. Here we localized the site of binding of PCSK9 within the extracellular domain of the LDLR and determined the fate of the receptor after PCSK9 binding. Recombinant human PCSK9 interacted in a sequence-specific manner with the first epidermal growth factor-like repeat (EGF-A) in the EGF homology domain of the human LDLR. Similar binding specificity was observed between PCSK9 and purified EGF-A. Binding to EGF-A was calcium-dependent and increased dramatically with reduction in pH from 7 to 5.2. The addition of PCSK9, but not heat-inactivated PCSK9, to the medium of cultured hepatocytes resulted in redistribution of the receptor from the plasma membrane to lysosomes. These data are consistent with a model in which PCSK9 binding to EGF-A interferes with an acid-dependent conformational change required for receptor recycling. As a consequence, the LDLR is rerouted from the endosome to the lysosome where it is degraded.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2007
12670700,Binding of purified Reelin to ApoER2 and VLDLR mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of Disabled-1.,"Reelin, Disabled-1 (Dab1), apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), and very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) participate in a signaling pathway required for layer formation during mammalian brain development. Binding of Reelin to ApoER2 and VLDLR induces a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1, an adaptor protein that associates with the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors. However, Reelin has also been proposed to signal through integrin and protocadherin. Here we compare the roles of ApoER2 and VLDLR in Reelin signaling. We used layer-specific markers to identify the final positions of early- and late-born neurons in the cortices of mice lacking ApoER2, VLDLR, or both ApoER2 and VLDLR. Subtle alterations were observed in mice lacking VLDLR, whereas more severe abnormalities were detected in the absence of ApoER2, and major disruptions were obvious in mice lacking both receptors. Purified Reelin associated more readily with ApoER2 than with VLDLR and no synergy was observed in the presence of both receptors. Consistent with the binding data, the level of Reelin-induced Dab1 phosphorylation was more severely reduced in neurons lacking ApoER2 than in neurons lacking VLDLR. However, similarly low levels of Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation were observed in ApoER2(-/-) and VLDLR(-/-) mice in vivo. Finally, there was a complete absence of Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 in cortical neurons from mice lacking both ApoER2 and VLDLR. These findings demonstrate that ApoER2 and VLDLR are essential for Reelin signaling and that no other receptor molecules can compensate for their role in mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1.",,
3023326,Binding of single-chain prourokinase to the urokinase receptor of human U937 cells.,"The single-chain form of human urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is the major form of the enzyme found in cells, tissues, and extracellular fluids. The protein, called pro-uPA, has high (Kd = 0.5 nM) affinity for the specific uPA receptor of U937 human monocyte-like cells. Its conversion to two-chain uPA by plasmin does not appreciably change the binding parameters. In addition, conversion of pro-uPA to uPA occurs with receptor-bound pro-uPA and does not lead to dissociation from the membrane. These data show that secreted pro-uPA can find its way to the specific surface receptor without previous conversion to the two-chain form and that, once bound, can be activated by plasmin.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1986
10741396,Binding of T lymphocytes to hippocampal neurons through ICAM-5 (telencephalin) and characterization of its interaction with the leukocyte integrin CD11a/CD18.,"Intercellular adhesion molecule-5 (ICAM-5, telencephalin) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on telencephalic neurons, and serves as a ligand for the leukocyte integrin CD11 a/CD18. We studied here the binding site in ICAM-5 for CD11a/CD18. Protein constructs containing the first immunoglobulin domain of ICAM-5 were able to support CD11a/CD18 interaction, while deletion of the first domain abolished binding. Monoclonal antibodies reacting with the first domain of ICAM-5 also completely blocked the interaction. The soluble first domain of ICAM-5 inhibited the binding of T cells to immobilized ICAM-5 at concentrations of 50 nM and higher. Interestingly, the sixth domain of ICAM-5 was also able to support leukocyte binding, but this binding activity may not involve leukocyte integrins. To test the involvement of ICAM-5 in leukocyte-neuron interactions, an assay using human T cells binding to rat hippocampal neurons was established. This binding was blocked by monoclonal antibodies against CD11a/CD18 and ICAM-5. Thus ICAM-5 may act as a major adhesion molecule for leukocyte binding to neurons in the central nervous system.",European journal of immunology,2000

9325340,Binding properties of neuroligin 1 and neurexin 1beta reveal function as heterophilic cell adhesion molecules.,"beta-Neurexins and neuroligins are plasma membrane proteins that are displayed on the neuronal cell surface. We have now investigated the interaction of neurexin 1beta with neuroligin 1 to evaluate their potential to function as heterophilic cell adhesion molecules. Using detergent-solubilized neuroligins and secreted neurexin 1beta-IgG fusion protein, we observed binding of these proteins to each other only in the presence of Ca2+ and in no other divalent cation tested. Only neurexin 1beta lacking an insert in splice site 4 bound neuroligins, whereas neurexin 1beta containing an insert was inactive. Half-maximal binding required 1-3 microM free Ca2+, which probably acts by binding to neuroligin 1 but not to neurexin 1beta. To determine if neurexin 1beta and neuroligin 1 can also interact with each other when present in a native membrane environment on the cell surface, we generated transfected cell lines expressing neuroligin 1 and neurexin 1beta. Upon mixing different cell populations, we found that cells aggregate only if cells expressing neurexin 1beta are mixed with cells expressing neuroligin 1. Aggregation was dependent on Ca2+ and was inhibited by the addition of soluble neurexin 1beta lacking an insert in splice site 4 but not by the addition of neurexin 1beta containing an insert in splice site 4. We conclude that neurexin 1beta and neuroligin 1 (and, by extension, other beta-neurexins and neuroligins) function as heterophilic cell adhesion molecules in a Ca2+-dependent reaction that is regulated by alternative splicing of beta-neurexins.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
8769372,Binding properties of somatostatin receptor subtypes.,"In the past few years, five different somatostatin (SRIF) receptor subtypes (sst1.5) have been identified, which form a distinct group in the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. The naturally occurring somatostatins SRIF-28, SRIF-25, and SRIF-14 all reveal high-affinity binding for sst1.5. In contrast, short synthetic analogs that are in clinical use, such as SMS 201-995, RC-160, or BIM 23014, primarily interact with the sst2 subtype. Some SRIF analogs were previously reported to be selective for one SRIF receptor subtype, eg, the sst2 (MK 678), the sst3 (BIM 23056), or the sst5 (BIM 23052, L362-855) subtype. However, when we studied the binding affinities of these SRIF analogs for human (h) sst1.5 expressed in either CHO or COS-1 cells, we were unable to confirm these previously reported selectivities. The absence of sst antagonists is a major drawback for investigating the functional role of each sst subtype. We used site-directed mutagenesis to identify amino acids that determine ligand specificity for sst2. A single Ser305 to Phe mutation in TM VII increased the affinity of hsst1, for SMS 201-995 nearly 100-fold, and when Gln291 was also exchanged to Asn in TM VII of hsst1, almost full sst2-like binding of SMS 201-995 was obtained. These data may aid in the design and synthesis of new selective type sst ligands. We have identified the expression of sst subtypes in nonclassical SRIF target tissue such as the lung. The pKi values for SRIF and various SRIF analogs in rat lung tissue preparations were in close correlation with those obtained for CHO cells expressing the sst4 subtype. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments revealed the predominant expression of mRNA specific for sst4 in mouse, rat, and human lung tissue, confirmed by autoradiographies of rat lung. No specific binding for [125I]Tyr3-SMS 201-995 was detected, since SMS 201-995 has low affinity for sst4. In contrast, specific binding of [125I]SRIF-28 to rat lung sections was demonstrated, which could be displaced by unlabelled SRIF-14 and SRIF-28, indicating specific, high affinity binding of this radioligand to sst4 receptors.",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,1996
10846180,"Binding sites of leukocyte beta 2 integrins (LFA-1, Mac-1) on the human ICAM-4/LW blood group protein.","The red cell ICAM-4/LW blood group glycoprotein, which belongs to the family of intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), has been reported to interact with CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) and CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) beta(2) integrins. To better define the basis of the ICAM-4/beta(2) integrin interaction, we have generated wild-type, domain-deleted and mutated recombinant chimeric ICAM-4-Fc proteins and analyzed their interaction in a cellular adhesion assay with LFA-1 and Mac-1 L-cell stable transfectants. We found that monoclonal antibodies against CD11a, CD11b, CD18, or LW(ab) block adhesion of transfectant L-cells to immobilized ICAM-4-Fc protein and that the ICAM-4/beta(2) integrin interaction was highly sensitive to the presence of the divalent cations Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). Deletion of individual Ig-domains D1 or D2 of the extracellular part of ICAM-4 showed that LFA-1 binds to the first Ig-like domain, whereas the Mac-1 binding site encompassed both the first and the second Ig-like domains. Based on the crystal structure of ICAM-2, we propose a model for the Ig-like domains D1 and D2 of ICAM-4. Accordingly, by site-directed mutagenesis of 22 amino acid positions spread out on all faces of the ICAM-4 molecule, we identified four exposed residues, Leu(80), Trp(93), and Arg(97) on the CFG face and Trp(77) on the E-F loop of domain D1 that may contact LFA-1 as part of the binding site. However, the single and double mutants R52E and T91Q on the CFG face of domain D1, which correspond to the key residues Glu(34) and Gln(73) for ICAM-1 binding to LFA-1, had no effect on LFA-1 binding. In contrast, all mutants on the CFG face of domain D1 and residues Glu(151) and Thr(154) in the C'-E loop of the domain D2 seem to play a dominant role in Mac-1 binding. These data suggest that the binding site for LFA-1 on ICAM-4 overlaps but is distinct from the Mac-1 binding site.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
10214951,Binding specificities and affinities of egf domains for ErbB receptors.,"ErbB receptor activation is a complex process and is dependent upon the type and number of receptors expressed on a given cell. Previous studies with defined combinations of ErbB receptors expressed in mammalian cells have helped elucidate specific biological responses for many of the recognized gene products that serve as ligands for these receptors. However, no study has examined the binding of these ligands in a defined experimental system. To address this issue, the relative binding affinities of the egf domains of eleven ErbB ligands were measured on six ErbB receptor combinations using a soluble receptor-ligand binding format. The ErbB2/4 heterodimer was shown to bind all ligands tested with moderate to very high affinity. In contrast, ErbB3 showed much more restrictive ligand binding specificity and measurable binding was observed only with heregulin, neuregulin2beta, epiregulin and the synthetic heregulin/egf chimera, biregulin. These studies also revealed that ErbB2 preferentially enhances ligand binding to ErbB3 or ErbB4 and to a lesser degree to ErbB1.",,
10942578,Bioactive motifs of agouti signal protein.,"The switch between the synthesis of eu- and pheomelanins is modulated by the interaction of two paracrine signaling molecules, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) and agouti signal protein (ASP), which interact with melanocytes via the MSH receptor (MC1R). Comparison of the primary sequence of ASP with the known MSH pharmacophore provides no suggestion about the putative bioactive domain(s) of ASP. To identify such bioactive motif(s), we synthesized 15-mer peptides that spanned the primary sequence of ASP and determined their effects on the melanogenic activities of murine melanocytes. Northern and Western blotting were used, together with chemical analysis of melanins and enzymatic assays, to identify three distinct bioactive regions of ASP that down-regulate eumelanogenesis. The decrease in eumelanin production was mediated by down-regulation of mRNA levels for tyrosinase and other melanogenic enzymes, as occurs in vivo, and these effects were comparable to those elicited by intact recombinant ASP. Shorter peptides in those motifs were synthesized and their effects on melanogenesis were further investigated. The amino acid arginine, which is present in the MSH peptide pharmacophore (HFRW), is also in the most active domain of ASP (KVARP). Our data suggest that lysines and an arginine (in motifs such as KxxxxKxxR or KxxRxxxxK) are important for the bioactivity of ASP. Identification of the specific ASP epitope that interacts with the MC1R has potential pharmacological applications in treating dysfunctions of skin pigmentation.",Experimental cell research,2000
28126904,"Biochemical and Cellular Analysis Reveals Ligand Binding Specificities, a Molecular Basis for Ligand Recognition, and Membrane Association-dependent Activities of Cripto-1 and Cryptic.","Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways are key determinants of cell fate in animals. Their basic mechanism of action is simple. However, to produce cell-specific responses, TGF-β pathways are heavily regulated by secondary factors, such as membrane-associated EGF-CFC family proteins. Cellular activities of EGF-CFC proteins have been described, but their molecular functions, including how the mammalian homologs Cripto-1 and Cryptic recognize and regulate TGF-β family ligands, are less clear. Here we use purified human Cripto-1 and mouse Cryptic produced in mammalian cells to show that these two EGF-CFC homologs have distinct, highly specific ligand binding activities. Cripto-1 interacts with BMP-4 in addition to its known partner Nodal, whereas Cryptic interacts only with Activin B. These interactions depend on the integrity of the protein, as truncated or deglycosylated Cripto-1 lacked BMP-4 binding activity. Significantly, Cripto-1 and Cryptic blocked binding of their cognate ligands to type I and type II TGF-β receptors, indicating that Cripto-1 and Cryptic contact ligands at their receptor interaction surfaces and, thus, that they could inhibit their ligands. Indeed, soluble Cripto-1 and Cryptic inhibited ligand signaling in various cell-based assays, including SMAD-mediated luciferase reporter gene expression, and differentiation of a multipotent stem cell line. But in agreement with previous work, the membrane bound form of Cripto-1 potentiated signaling, revealing a critical role of membrane association for its established cellular activity. Thus, our studies provide new insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition by this enigmatic family of membrane-anchored TGF-β family signaling regulators and link membrane association with their signal potentiating activities.",,
17337079,Biochemical anti-opioid action of NPFF2 receptors in rat spinal cord.,"Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) agonists counteract the cellular opioid actions. We demonstrate for the first time a biochemical anti-opioid effect of NPFF receptors in the rat spinal cord by using the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay in autoradiography. The mu agonist DAMGO as well as the potent and selective NPFF(2) agonist dNPA, stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding at different optimal GDP concentrations. dNPA decreased the effects induced by DAMGO alone; the maximal of G-protein coupling was decreased but not the potency of opioid agonist. We conclude that NPFF(2) receptors are coupled to G-protein in the rat spinal cord and could exert a molecular anti-opioid effect.",,
9819197,"Biochemical, biophysical, and pharmacological characterization of bacterially expressed human agouti-related protein.","The agouti-related protein gene (Agrp) is a novel gene implicated in the control of feeding behavior. The hypothalamic expression of Agrp is regulated by leptin, and overexpression of Agrp in transgenic animals results in obesity and diabetes. By analogy with the known actions of agouti, these data suggest a role for the Agrp gene product in the regulation of melanocortin receptors expressed in the central nervous system. The availability of recombinant, highly purified protein is required to fully address this potential interaction. A nearly full-length form of AGRP (MKd5-AGRP) was expressed in the cytosolic or soluble fraction of Escherichia coli and appeared as large intermolecular disulfide-bonded aggregates. Following oxidation, refolding, and purification, this protein was soluble, and eluted as a single symmetric peak on RP-HPLC. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the purified protein contains primarily random coil and beta-sheet secondary structure. Sedimentation velocity studies at neutral pH demonstrated that MKd5-AGRP is monomeric at low micromolar concentrations. Mobility shifts observed using SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions for bacterially expressed and mammalian expressed AGRP were identical, an indication of a similar disulfide structure. The purification to homogeneity of a second, truncated form of AGRP (Md65-AGRP) which was expressed in the insoluble or inclusion body fraction is also described. Both forms act as competitive antagonists of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) at melanocortin-3 (MC-3) and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC-4). The demonstration that AGRP is an endogenous antagonist with respect to these receptors is a unique mechanism within the central nervous system, and has important implications in the control of feeding.",,
11952095,Biochemistry and physiology of the natriuretic peptide receptor guanylyl cyclases.,"Guanylyl cyclases (GC) exist as soluble and particulate, membrane-associated enzymes which catalyse the conversion of GTP to cGMP, an intracellular signalling molecule. Several membrane forms of the enzyme have been identified up to now. Some of them serve as receptors for the natriuretic peptides, a family of peptides which includes atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), three peptides known to play important roles in renal and cardiovascular physiology. These are transmembrane proteins composed of a single transmembrane domain, a variable extracellular natriuretic peptide-binding domain, and a more conserved intracellular kinase homology domain (KHD) and catalytic domain. GC-A, the receptor for ANP and BNP, also named natriuretic peptide receptor-A or -1 (NPR-A or NPR- 1), has been studied widely. Its mode of activation by peptide ligands and mechanisms of regulation serve as prototypes for understanding the function of other particulate GC. Activation of this enzyme by its ligand is a complex process requiring oligomerization, ligand binding, KHD phosphorylation and ATP binding. Gene knockout and genetic segregation studies have provided strong evidence for the importance of GC-A in the regulation of blood pressure and heart and renal functions. GC-B is the main receptor for CNP, the latter having a more paracrine role at the vascular and venous levels. The structure and regulation of GC-B is similar to that of GC-A. This chapter reviews the structure and roles of GC-A and GC-B in blood pressure regulation and cardiac and renal pathophysiology.",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,2002
10390077,Biological and clinical implications of interleukin-7 and lymphopoiesis.,"Interleukin 7 (IL-7) is a stromal cell-derived cytokine that stands out as being the only cytokine identified to date on which development of B and T lymphocytes is absolutely dependent. IL-7 functions primarily as a growth and antiapoptosis factor for B- and T-cell (alphabeta and gammadelta TCR+ cells) precursors, and is essential for differentiation of gammadelta TCR+ cells. IL-7 can function as a cofactor during myelopoiesis, and is capable of activating monocytes/macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. Its receptor (IL-7R) is a heterodimer of an alpha chain that specifically binds IL-7 and the common gamma chain gammac that is also a component of the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-9 and IL-15. The functions of IL-7 in normal lymphocyte development and activation have led to the demonstration of the ability of IL-7 to stimulate lymphopoiesis in lymphopenic mice, suggesting a possible clinical application of IL-7 in accelerating lymphoid reconstitution in lymphopenic patients. There have also been a number of preclinical studies pointing to the possible utility of IL-7 in antitumor clinical applications, and clinical trials involving IL-7 gene therapy of metastatic disease are underway. IL-7 has also been shown to promote engraftment of stem cells in mice receiving bone marrow transplants, pointing to a possible use of IL-7 in patients receiving bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants. Areas of IL-7 biology that are essentially unexplored include the mechanisms of regulation of the expression of IL-7 and IL-7Ralpha, as well as the mechanisms by which IL-7 is a growth and differentiation factor for gammadelta T cells but a growth factor only for alphabeta T cells.","Cytokines, cellular & molecular therapy",1999
15284220,Biological characterization of angiopoietin-3 and angiopoietin-4.,"The angiopoietin (Ang) family of growth factors includes Ang1, Ang2, Ang3, and Ang4, all of which bind to the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2. Ang3 (mouse) and Ang4 (human) are interspecies orthologs. In experiments with human endothelial cell lines, Ang3 was identified as an antagonist of Tie2 and Ang4 was identified as an agonist of Tie2. However, the biological roles of Ang3 and Ang4 are unknown. We examined the biological effect of recombinant Ang3 and Ang4 proteins in primary cultured endothelial cells and in vivo in mice. Recombinant Ang3 and Ang4 formed disulfide-linked dimers. Ang4 (400 ng/mL) markedly increased Tie2 and Akt phosphorylation in primary cultured HUVECs whereas Ang3 (400 ng/mL) did not produce significant changes. Accordingly, Ang4, but not Ang3, induced survival and migration in primary cultured HUVECs. Unexpectedly, intravenously administered Ang3 (30 microg) was more potent than Ang4 (30 microg) in phosphorylating the Tie2 receptor in lung tissue from mice in vivo. Accordingly, Ang3 was more potent than Ang4 in phosphorylating Akt in primary cultured mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells. Ang3 and Ang4 both produced potent corneal angiogenesis extending from the limbus across the mouse cornea in vivo. Thus, Ang3 and Ang4 are agonists of Tie2, but mouse Ang3 has strong activity only on endothelial cells of its own species.",,
3018723,"Biologically active precursor for transforming growth factor type alpha, released by retrovirally transformed cells.",Retrovirus-transformed rat cells that actively express transforming growth factor type alpha (TGF-alpha) release into the medium a soluble protein of 17-19 kDa that has been identified as a precursor for TGF-alpha. The identification of this protein as a TGF-alpha precursor is based on its recognition by specific antibodies and by the ability of elastase to convert this protein into a 6-kDa polypeptide with the properties of mature TGF-alpha. This TGF-alpha precursor binds to epidermal growth factor/TGF-alpha receptors and activates the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity in intact cells. The biological potency of this precursor is not markedly increased by conversion into mature TGF-alpha in vitro. These studies demonstrate the ability of transformed cells to release a TGF-alpha precursor capable of strong mitogenic action in vivo.,,
10339405,Biophysical analysis of the interaction of human ifnar2 expressed in E. coli with IFNalpha2.,"Type I interferons are cytokines which activate an anti-viral response by binding to two specific cell surface receptors, ifnar1 and ifnar2. Here, we report purification and refolding of the extracellular part of human ifnar2 (ifnar2-EC) expressed in Escherichia coli and its characterization with respect to its interaction with interferon alpha2 (IFNalpha2). The 25 kDa, non-glycosylated ifnar2-EC is a stable, fully active protein, which inhibits antiviral activity of IFNalpha2. The stoichiometry of binding IFNalpha2 is 1:1, as determined by gel filtration, chemical cross-linking and solid-phase detection. The affinity of this interaction is 10 nM, which is similar to the affinity measured for the cell surface-bound ifnar2 receptor. No difference in affinity was found throughout various assays using optical detection as BIAcore or reflectometric interference spectorscopy. However, the binding kinetics as measured in homogeneous phase by fluorescence de-quenching was about three times faster than that measured on a sensor surface. The rate of complex formation is relatively high compared to other cytokine-receptor interactions. The salt dependence of the association kinetics suggest a limited but significant contribution of electrostatic forces towards the rate of complex formation. The dissociation constant increases with decreasing pH according to the protonation of a base with a pKa of 6.7. The surface properties of the IFNalpha2 binding surface on ifnar2 were interpreted according to the pH and salt dependence of the interaction.",Journal of molecular biology,1999
18234675,Biophysical characterization of O-glycosylated CD99 recognition by paired Ig-like type 2 receptors.,"Paired Ig-like type 2 receptors (PILRs) are one of the paired receptor families, which consist of two functionally opposite members, inhibitory (PILRalpha) and activating (PILRbeta) receptors. PILRs are widely expressed in immune cells and recognize the sialylated O-glycosylated ligand CD99, which is expressed on activated T cells, to regulate immune responses. To date, their biophysical properties have not yet been examined. Here we report the affinity, kinetic, and thermodynamic analyses of PILR-CD99 interactions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) together with site-directed mutagenesis. The SPR analysis clearly demonstrated that inhibitory PILRalpha can bind to CD99 with low affinity (K(d) approximately 2.2 microm), but activating PILRbeta binds with approximately 40 times lower affinity (K(d) approximately 85 microm). In addition to our previous mutagenesis study (Wang, J., Shiratori, I., Saito, T., Lanier, L. L., and Arase, H. (2008) J. Immunol. 180, 1686-1693), the SPR analysis showed that PILRalpha can bind to each Ala mutant of the two CD99 O-glycosylated sites (Thr-45 and Thr-50) with similar binding affinity to wild-type CD99. This indicated that both residues act as independent and equivalent PILRalpha binding sites, consistent with the highly flexible structure of CD99. On the other hand, it is further confirmed that PILRbeta can bind the T50A mutant, but not the T45A mutant, indicating a recognition difference between PILRalpha and PILRbeta. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the PILR-CD99 interactions show fast dissociation rates, typical of cell-cell recognition receptors. Thermodynamic analyses revealed that the PILRalpha-CD99 interaction is enthalpically driven with a large entropy loss (-TDeltaS = 8.9 kcal.mol(-1)), suggesting the reduction of flexibility upon complex formation. This is in contrast to the entropically driven binding of selectins to sugar-modified ligands involved in leukocyte rolling and infiltration, which may reflect their functional differences.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2008
9305636,Bivalence of EGF-like ligands drives the ErbB signaling network.,"Signaling by epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like ligands is mediated by an interactive network of four ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases, whose mechanism of ligand-induced dimerization is unknown. We contrasted two existing models: a conformation-driven activation of a receptor-intrinsic dimerization site and a ligand bivalence model. Analysis of a Neu differentiation factor (NDF)-induced heterodimer between ErbB-3 and ErbB-2 favors a bivalence model; the ligand simultaneously binds both ErbB-3 and ErbB-2, but, due to low-affinity of the second binding event, ligand bivalence drives dimerization only when the receptors are membrane anchored. Results obtained with a chimera and isoforms of NDF/neuregulin predict that each terminus of the ligand molecule contains a distinct binding site. The C-terminal low-affinity site has broad specificity, but it prefers interaction with ErbB-2, an oncogenic protein acting as a promiscuous low-affinity subunit of the three primary receptors. Thus, ligand bivalence enables signal diversification through selective recruitment of homo- and heterodimers of ErbB receptors, and it may explain oncogenicity of erbB-2/HER2.",The EMBO journal,1997
36377656,Blockade of the immunosuppressive KIR2DL5/PVR pathway elicits potent human NK cell-mediated antitumor immunity.,"Cancer immunotherapy targeting the TIGIT/PVR pathway is currently facing challenges. KIR2DL5, a member of the human killer cell, immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family, has recently been identified as another binding partner for PVR. The biology and therapeutic potential of the KIR2DL5/PVR pathway are largely unknown. Here we report that KIR2DL5 was predominantly expressed on human NK cells with mature phenotype and cytolytic function and that it bound to PVR without competition with the other 3 known PVR receptors. The interaction between KIR2DL5 on NK cells and PVR on target cells induced inhibitory synapse formation, whereas new monoclonal antibodies blocking the KIR2DL5-PVR interaction robustly augmented the NK cytotoxicity against PVR+ human tumors. Mechanistically, both intracellular ITIM and ITSM of KIR2DL5 underwent tyrosine phosphorylation after engagement, which was essential for KIR2DL5-mediated NK suppression by recruiting SHP-1 and/or SHP-2. Subsequently, ITIM/SHP-1/SHP-2 and ITSM/SHP-1 downregulated the downstream Vav1/ERK1/2/p90RSK/NF-κB signaling. KIR2DL5+ immune cells infiltrated in various types of PVR+ human cancers. Markedly, the KIR2DL5 blockade reduced tumor growth and improved overall survival across multiple NK cell-based humanized tumor models. Thus, our results revealed functional mechanisms of KIR2DL5-mediated NK cell immune evasion, demonstrated blockade of the KIR2DL5/PVR axis as a therapy for human cancers, and provided an underlying mechanism for the clinical failure of anti-TIGIT therapies.",,
17222790,Blocking neuropilin-1 function has an additive effect with anti-VEGF to inhibit tumor growth.,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) guides the development of the nervous and vascular systems. Binding to either semaphorins or VEGF, NRP1 acts with plexins to regulate neuronal guidance, or with VEGFR2 to mediate vascular development. We have generated two monoclonal antibodies that bind to the Sema- and VEGF-binding domains of NRP1, respectively. Both antibodies reduce angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, while having little effect on other VEGFR2-mediated events. Importantly, anti-NRP1 antibodies have an additive effect with anti-VEGF therapy in reducing tumor growth. Vessels from tumors treated with anti-VEGF show a close association with pericytes, while tumors treated with both anti-NRP1 and anti-VEGF lack this organization. We propose that blocking NRP1 function inhibits vascular remodeling, rendering vessels more susceptible to anti-VEGF therapy.",,
10880444,BMP-2 antagonists emerge from alterations in the low-affinity binding epitope for receptor BMPR-II.,"Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) induces bone formation and regeneration in adult vertebrates and regulates important developmental processes in all animals. BMP-2 is a homodimeric cysteine knot protein that, as a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, signals by oligomerizing type I and type II receptor serine-kinases in the cell membrane. The binding epitopes of BMP-2 for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity. These findings provide a framework for the molecular description of receptor recognition and activation in the BMP/TGF-beta superfamily.",,
12044914,Bmp15 mutations and ovarian function.,"BMP15, also known as growth and differentiation factor 9B (GDF9B), is a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (TGFbeta) which in humans, rodents and sheep is expressed exclusively in the oocyte. BMP15 is closely related to GDF9, another oocyte-specific member of this superfamily which has been shown to be essential for early ovarian folliculogenesis. Inactivation of the BMP15 gene in mice has shown only minor effects on fertility. However, Inverdale and Hanna lines of sheep carry naturally occurring mutations in BMP15 which highlight differences in the action of this gene between mice and other mammals. Sheep which are heterozygous show an increase in ovulation rate whereas homozygotes are infertile. The granulosa cell receptor which mediates the BMP15 response has not yet been identified, but the discovery that a point mutation in the BMP1B receptor in Booroola sheep is responsible for increased ovulation rate highlights the importance of the TGFbeta signalling molecules in early folliculogenesis.",Molecular and cellular endocrinology,2002
22074949,BMP3 suppresses osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells via interaction with Acvr2b.,"Enhancing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling increases bone formation in a variety of settings that target bone repair. However, the role of BMP in the maintenance of adult bone mass is not well understood. Targeted disruption of BMP3 in mice results in increased trabecular bone formation, whereas transgenic overexpression of BMP3 in skeletal cells leads to spontaneous fracture, consistent with BMP3 having a negative role in bone mass regulation. Here we investigate the importance of BMP3 as a mediator of BMP signaling in the adult skeleton. We find that osteoblasts (OBL) and osteocytes are the source of BMP3 in adult bone. Using in vitro cultures of primary bone marrow stromal cells, we show that overexpression of BMP3 suppresses OBL differentiation, whereas loss of BMP3 increases colony-forming unit fibroblasts and colony-forming unit OBL. The ability of BMP3 to affect OBL differentiation is due to its interaction with activin receptor type 2b (Acvr2b) because knockdown of endogenous Acvr2b in bone marrow stromal cells reduces the suppressive effect of BMP3 on OBL differentiation. These findings best fit a model in which BMP3, produced by mature bone cells, acts to reduce BMP signaling through Acvr2b in skeletal progenitor cells, limiting their differentiation to mature OBL. Our data further support the idea that endogenous BMPs have a physiological role in regulating adult bone mass.",,

17086203,Boc is a receptor for sonic hedgehog in the guidance of commissural axons.,"In the spinal cord, sonic hedgehog (Shh) is secreted by the floor plate to control the generation of distinct classes of ventral neurons along the dorsoventral axis. Genetic and in vitro studies have shown that Shh also later acts as a midline-derived chemoattractant for commissural axons. However, the receptor(s) responsible for Shh attraction remain unknown. Here we show that two Robo-related proteins, Boc and Cdon, bind specifically to Shh and are therefore candidate receptors for the action of Shh as an axon guidance ligand. Boc is expressed by commissural neurons, and targeted disruption of Boc in mouse results in the misguidance of commissural axons towards the floor plate. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of Boc impairs the ability of rat commissural axons to turn towards an ectopic source of Shh in vitro. Taken together, these data suggest that Boc is essential as a receptor for Shh in commissural axon guidance.",,
1720612,"Bombesin, neuromedin B and neuromedin C interact with a common rat pancreatic phosphoinositide-coupled receptor, but are differentially regulated by guanine nucleotides.","Bombesin (BB), neuromedin C (NMC) and neuromedin B (NMB) stimulated amylase secretion to similar maximum levels, with EC50 values (concentrations causing 50% of maximum effect) of 0.2, 0.3 and 2 nM respectively. Treatment of pancreatic acini with BB or NMB (10 nM) for 30 min resulted in cross-desensitization of secretory responses to subsequent BB and NMB, but not to acetylcholine, which suggests that NMB and BB activate the same receptor. BB, NMC and NMB stimulated production of similar maximum amounts of inositol mono-, bis- and tris-phosphates, with EC50 values of 3, 5 and 141 nM respectively. The bombesin receptor antagonist [Leu13-psi(CH2NH)Leu14]BB inhibited stimulation of amylase secretion and inositol phosphate formation by BB, NMC and NMB. Binding of 125I-labelled gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP; 200 pM) to rat pancreatic membranes at 22 degrees C was inhibited with relative potencies and IC50 (concn. causing 50% of maximal inhibition; nM) as follows: NMC (0.4) = BB (0.5) greater than NMB (1.8 = GRP (2.6). IC50 values for BB, NMC and NMB inhibition of 125I-GRP binding to intact acini were 5-, 19- and 68-fold higher than their respective values in membranes. The guanine nucleotide analogue guanosine 5'-[beta gamma-imido]triphosphate (Gpp[NH]p) produced rightward shifts of NMC and NMB competition curves by 3.5- and 16-fold respectively, but had little effect on the BB and GRP curves. Elevation of the temperature to 37 degrees C or inclusion of NaCl (40 mM) produced quantitatively similar effects to those of Gpp[NH]p. In the presence of both NaCl and Gpp[NH]p the affinities of peptides for membrane receptors were similar to those for intact cells. Modulation of NMB competition curves by Gpp[NH]p was not attenuated by prior treatment of acini with activated pertussis toxin. These results suggest that BB, NMB and NMC stimulate pancreatic secretion by interaction with a common phosphoinositide-linked receptor. Differences in guanine nucleotide regulation suggest that secretagogue-induced receptor-protein interactions may not be identical for NMB and BB.",The Biochemical journal,1991
12135884,Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II is a receptor for growth differentiation factor-9.,"Growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) is a glycoprotein secreted by the oocyte that is capable of stimulating granulosa cell proliferation and inhibiting differentiation. GDF-9 is a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of ligands known to signal through type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors. In the sequenced human genome, seven type I and six type II receptors have been identified. Based on phylogenetic and sequence analyses, we predicted that GDF-9 likely interacts with known type I and type II receptors. We obtained soluble chimeric proteins with the ectodomains of candidate receptors fused to the Fc portion of immunoglobin and tested their ability to act as functional antagonists. Addition of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPRII) ectodomain was most effective in blocking GDF-9 stimulation of granulosa cell proliferation and GDF-9 suppression of FSH-stimulated progesterone production. In addition, the ectodomains of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IA, bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IB, and activin receptor type IIA were partially effective in blocking GDF-9 action. Furthermore, the BMPRII ectodomain directly interacted with GDF-9 in a coprecipitation study demonstrating the role of the BMPRII ectodomain as a binding protein for GDF-9. To demonstrate the role of BMPRII in GDF-9 signaling in follicular cells, the expression of this protein was blocked in cultured granulosa cells using specific BMPRII antisense oligomers. Inhibition of BMPRII biosynthesis completely prevented the GDF-9 induction of granulosa cell thymidine incorporation. GDF-9 expression is essential for early follicle development, and the presence of the type II and type I receptors in the neonatal rat ovary was verified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These results demonstrate the important role of BMPRII in mediating GDF-9 action in granulosa cells from small antral follicles and indicate that the effects of GDF-9 might be transduced by binding to BMPRII and one or more type I receptors.",Biology of reproduction,2002
8605097,Bone morphogenetic protein type IB receptor is progressively expressed in malignant glioma tumours.,"The distribution of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptors and the activin type I receptor (ActR-I) was investigated in 16 cases of human glioma and five cases of non-tumourous gliosis tissue by immunohistochemical technique. Both BMP type IA (BMPR-IA) and the type IB (BMPR-IB) receptors were detected in human glioma cells. A significant increase in BMPR-IB in tumour cells was observed in malignant glioma compared with both low-grade astrocytomas (n=16, P<0.005) and gliosis (n=13, P<0.001). However, enhancement of BMPR-IA staining was moderate and ActR-I staining was only weakly expressed in the malignant glioma tumours. Osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, which is known to bind BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB and ActR-I, was expressed in nervous tissue and was also detected in anaplastic areas of malignant glioma. In contrast to the tissue materials, BMPR-IA was expressed to a stronger degree than BMPR-IB in human glioma cell lines; the growth of these cells was suppressed by OP-1. These results suggest the presence of BMP receptors and a functional role for BMPs in malignant glioma.",British journal of cancer,1996
12700180,"Bone morphogenetic proteins, their antagonists, and the skeleton.","Skeletal homeostasis is determined by systemic hormones and local factors. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are unique because they induce the differentiation of mesenchymal cells toward cells of the osteoblastic lineage and also enhance the differentiated function of the osteoblast. However, the activity of BMPs needs to be tempered by intracellular and extracellular antagonists. BMPs bind to specific receptors and signal by phosphorylating the cytoplasmic proteins mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad) 1 and 5, which form heterodimers with Smad 4, and after nuclear translocation regulate transcription. BMP antagonists can be categorized as pseudoreceptors that compete with signaling receptors, inhibitory Smads that block signaling, intracellular binding proteins that bind Smad 1 and 5, and factors that induce ubiquitination and proteolysis of signaling Smads. In addition, a large number of extracellular proteins that bind BMPs and prevent their binding to signaling receptors have emerged. They are the components of the Spemann organizer, noggin, chordin, and follistatin, members of the Dan/Cerberus family, and twisted gastrulation. The antagonists tend to be specific for BMPs and are regulated by BMPs, indicating the existence and need of local feedback mechanisms to temper BMP cellular activities.",,
7545666,Both extracellular immunoglobin-like domains of CD80 contain residues critical for binding T cell surface receptors CTLA-4 and CD28.,"The B7-related molecules CD80 and CD86 are expressed on antigen-presenting cells, bind the homologous T cell receptors CD28 and CTLA-4, and trigger costimulatory signals important for optimal T cell activation. All four molecules are immunoglobulin superfamily members, each comprising an extracellular Ig variable-like (IgV) domain, with CD80 and CD86 containing an additional Ig constant-like (IgC) domain. Despite limited sequence identity, CD80 and CD86 share similar overall receptor binding properties and effector functions. We have identified, by site-directed mutagenesis of soluble forms of CD80 and CD86, residues in both the IgV and IgC domains that are important for CTLA4Ig and CD28Ig binding. Mutagenesis in the IgV domain of CD80 identified 11 amino acids that support receptor binding. Many of these residues are conserved in the B7 family, are hydrophobic, and approximately map to the GFCC'C"" beta-sheet face of an IgV fold. Mutagenesis of corresponding residues in CD86 established that some, but not all, of these residues also played a role in CD86 receptor binding. In general, mutations had a similar effect on CTLA4Ig and CD28Ig binding, thereby indicating that both receptors bind to overlapping sites on CD80 and CD86. Further, mutagenesis of several conserved residues in the ABED beta-sheet face of the IgC domain of CD80 completely ablated receptor binding. Point mutagenesis had a more pronounced effect than complete truncation of the IgC domain. Thus, full CTLA4Ig and CD28Ig binding to B7 molecules is dependent upon residues in the GFC'C"" face of the IgV domain and the ABED face of the IgC domain.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1995
12097820,Both ICAM-1- and VCAM-1-integrin interactions are important in mediating monocyte adhesion to human saphenous vein.,"Atherosclerosis underlies late occlusion of human saphenous vein (HSV) coronary artery bypass grafts. Monocyte infiltration is implicated, but its mechanisms are unclear given that HSV normally expresses the ICAM-1 but not the VCAM-1 adhesion molecule. To define the mechanisms underlying monocyte adhesion, samples of HSV taken from coronary artery bypass graft patients were co-cultured with human monocytes and adherent monocytes were quantified by immunocytochemistry for CD68 on transverse sections. Pre-treatment of veins with anti-ICAM-1 antibodies reduced monocyte adhesion (monocytes/mm of section) from 7.2 +/- 1.5 to 3.1 +/- 0.7 (p < 0.05, n = 6), but the effect of anti-VCAM-1 was not significant (4.1 +/- 0.7). Paradoxically, pre-treatment of monocytes with either anti-beta(2)-integrins, the counter-receptor of ICAM-1, or anti-alpha(4) integrins, the counter-receptor of VCAM-1, significantly reduced adhesion (1.8 +/- 0.6 and 2.4 +/- 0.7, respectively, p < 0.05). These results were clarified by immunocytochemistry, which confirmed that VCAM-1 expression was absent in harvested vein but was induced in the endothelium during co-culture. Consistent with this, when anti-ICAM-1 or anti-VCAM-1 was present throughout co-culture, either of them reduced adhesion (from 4.2 +/- 0.9 to 2.3 +/- 0.5 and 2.2 +/- 0.4, respectively, p < 0.02, n = 8) and there was no further effect of adding both (2.0 +/- 0.5). These results demonstrate that both ICAM-1/beta(2) and VCAM-1/alpha(4) integrin interactions mediate monocyte adhesion to HSV, possibly as part of a common pathway. These experiments imply that either integrin might be targeted to reduce monocyte infiltration into HSV grafts.",Journal of vascular research,2002
8137938,"Both interleukin-8 receptors independently mediate chemotaxis. Jurkat cells transfected with IL-8R1 or IL-8R2 migrate in response to IL-8, GRO alpha and NAP-2.","Neutrophil leukocytes, the target cells for interleukin-8 and related CXC chemokines, bear high numbers of two types of IL-8 receptors (IL-8R1 and IL-8R2). By cDNA transfection Jurkat cell lines were generated that stably express either IL-8R1 or IL-8R2 (J-IL8R1 and J-IL8R2). J-IL8R1 expressed 4,000 +/- 1,000 copies of IL-8R1, and bound IL-8 with high affinity (Kd 1-4 nM) and GRO alpha and NAP-2 with low affinity (Kd 200-500 nM). J-IL8R2 expressed 17,000 +/- 3,000 copies of IL-8R2, and bound all three chemokines with high affinity. Both transfectants showed a similar degree of chemotactic migration after stimulation with IL-8, GRO alpha and NAP-2. All three chemokines were equally potent as attractants of J-IL8R2, whereas IL-8 was 300 to 1,000-fold more potent than GRO alpha or NAP-2 as attractant of J-IL8R1. The potencies, therefore, agree with the affinities of the ligands to IL-8R1 and IL-8R2. Our results demonstrate that both IL-8 receptors function independently, and mediate chemotaxis in response to IL-8 and other CXC chemokines.",FEBS letters,1994
7644540,Brain-derived neurotrophic factor rapidly enhances synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons via postsynaptic tyrosine kinase receptors.,"Although neurotrophins are primarily associated with long-term effects on neuronal survival and differentiation, recent studies have shown that acute changes in synaptic transmission can also be produced. In the hippocampus, an area critically involved in learning and memory, we have found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rapidly enhanced synaptic efficacy through a previously unreported mechanism--increased postsynaptic responsiveness via a phosphorylation-dependent pathway. Within minutes of BDNF application to cultured hippocampal neurons, spontaneous firing rate was dramatically increased, as were the frequency and amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents. The increased frequency of postsynaptic currents resulted from the change in presynaptic firing. However, the increased amplitude was postsynaptic in origin because it was selectively blocked by intracellular injection of the tyrosine kinase receptor (Ntrk2/TrkB) inhibitor K-252a and potentiated by injection of the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. These results suggest a role for BDNF in the modulation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1995
12796776,BTLA is a lymphocyte inhibitory receptor with similarities to CTLA-4 and PD-1.,"During activation, T cells express receptors for receiving positive and negative costimulatory signals. Here we identify the B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), an immunoglobulin domain-containing glycoprotein with two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. BTLA is not expressed by naive T cells, but it is induced during activation and remains expressed on T helper type 1 (T(H)1) but not T(H)2 cells. Crosslinking BTLA with antigen receptors induces its tyrosine phosphorylation and association with the Src homology domain 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, and attenuates production of interleukin 2 (IL-2). BTLA-deficient T cells show increased proliferation, and BTLA-deficient mice have increased specific antibody responses and enhanced sensitivity to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. B7x, a peripheral homolog of B7, is a ligand of BTLA. Thus, BTLA is a third inhibitory receptor on T lymphocytes with similarities to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1).",Nature immunology,2003
7531888,Building synapses: agrin and dystroglycan stick together.,"A major effort of the past decade for those studying synaptic development has been to identify the molecular signals whose carefully choreographed exchange between pre- and postsynaptic cells regulates the local differentiation of each cell to form the mature synapse. Now that several of these factors [agrin, ACh-receptor inducing activity (ARIA) and calcitonin gene-related peptide] have been identified and isolated, efforts have moved toward understanding their receptors and the intracellular signaling pathways by which the factors achieve their effects. One of the most intensively studied of the synaptic signaling molecules is agrin, a large protein synthesized and released by motor neurons that induces ACh receptors and other synaptic molecules in muscle cells to accumulate at the sites of nerve contact. Recent efforts to discover the agrin receptor have led to a surprising conclusion: the only agrin-binding component so far detected in muscle cells is dystroglycan, an extracellular protein that is part of the complex of proteins associated with dystrophin, and its homologue, utrophin. Because dystroglycan binds laminin, and dystrophin binds actin, the complex containing these two proteins is thought to link the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton. Those interested in synapses are now pondering whether dystroglycan has a new and unexpected role as a signaling receptor for agrin-induced ACh-receptor clustering, whether it serves as an auxiliary for another receptor, or whether it serves as a receptor for an entirely different agrin-mediated function.",,
9388254,C1 inhibitor-C1s complexes are internalized and degraded by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein.,"Like other serpin-enzyme complexes (SECs), proteinase-complexed C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) is rapidly cleared from the circulation and thought to be a neutrophil chemoattractant, suggesting that complex formation causes structural rearrangements exposing a domain which is recognized by specific cell surface receptors. However, the cellular receptor(s) responsible for the catabolism and potential mediation of chemotaxis by C1-INH-protease complexes remained obscure. To determine whether the SEC receptor mediates the binding and potential chemotaxis of C1-INH.Cs, we performed binding assays with HepG2 cells, neutrophils, and monocytes, and the results show that C1-INH.Cs neither bind to these cells nor cause a chemotactic response of neutrophils and monocytes. Furthermore, C1-INH.Cs, the COOH-terminal C1 inhibitor peptide, or the tetrameric C1-INH.Cs.Cr. C1-INH complex were found to be significantly less effective in competing with the SEC receptor ligand 125I-peptide 105Y for the binding to HepG2 cells than unlabeled 105Y, indicating that the SEC receptor does not sufficiently recognize C1-INH-protease complexes. The asialoglycoprotein receptor was also ruled out to be responsible for the removal of the heavily glycosylated C1-INH.Cs complex, since asialoorosomucoid did not compete for the clearance of C1-INH. 125I-Cs and asialoglycoprotein receptor knockout mice showed no alterations in the C1-INH.125I-Cs clearance rate. We found that C1-INH.125I-Cs complexes were efficiently degraded by normal murine fibroblasts expressing the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and cellular degradation was significantly reduced by chloroquine and the receptor-associated protein, which is a potent inhibitor of the binding of all known ligands to LRP. Moreover, receptor-associated protein inhibited the in vivo clearance of C1-INH.125I-Cs and murine fibroblasts genetically deficient for LRP did not degrade C1-INH.125I-Cs. Our results demonstrate that C1-INH. Cs complexes do not stimulate neutrophil or monocytic chemotaxis but are removed by LRP, further underscoring its role as a serpin-enzyme complex clearance receptor.",,
10528211,C1q and C4b bind simultaneously to CR1 and additively support erythrocyte adhesion.,"Previously, we showed that soluble C1q bound specifically to CR1 on transfected cells. If the CR1-C1q interaction were to participate in immune complex clearance, then this interaction should support E adhesion. Using a tip plate adhesion assay, we found that immobilized C1q mediated adhesion of human E. E binding to C1q was specifically inhibited by polyclonal anti-CR1 Fab fragments. Intact C1 was not efficient as an adherence ligand until it was treated with EDTA or the C1 inhibitor to remove the C1r2C1s2 complex from C1, leaving C1q. Titration of C1q alone, C4b alone, and C1q + C4b indicated that the two complement ligands were additive in their ability to support CR1-mediated adhesion of E. Analysis of binding to immobilized CR1 using a BIAcore instrument documented that C1q, C4b, and C3b binding were independent events. Additionally, C1q-dependent binding of immune complexes and heat-aggregated IgG to E was documented. These experiments confirm that the immune adherence receptor in humans, CR1, is the single receptor for all of the opsonic ligands of complement, provide evidence for a single C1q binding site on LHR-D of CR1, and suggest that C1q may participate in immune clearance.",,
11560994,C1q and mannose binding lectin engagement of cell surface calreticulin and CD91 initiates macropinocytosis and uptake of apoptotic cells.,"Removal of apoptotic cells is essential for maintenance of tissue homeostasis, organogenesis, remodeling, development, and maintenance of the immune system, protection against neoplasia, and resolution of inflammation. The mechanisms of this removal involve recognition of the apoptotic cell surface and initiation of phagocytic uptake into a variety of cell types. Here we provide evidence that C1q and mannose binding lectin (MBL), a member of the collectin family of proteins, bind to apoptotic cells and stimulate ingestion of these by ligation on the phagocyte surface of the multifunctional protein, calreticulin (also known as the cC1qR), which in turn is bound to the endocytic receptor protein CD91, also known as the alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor. Use of these proteins provides another example of apoptotic cell clearance mediated by pattern recognition molecules of the innate immune system. Ingestion of the apoptotic cells through calreticulin/CD91 stimulation is further shown to involve the process of macropinocytosis, implicated as a primitive and relatively nonselective uptake mechanism for C1q- and MBL-enhanced engulfment of whole, intact apoptotic cells, as well as cell debris and foreign organisms to which these molecules may bind.",The Journal of experimental medicine,2001
12818164,C4b-binding protein (C4BP) activates B cells through the CD40 receptor.,"We demonstrate that the alpha chain of human C4b binding protein (C4BP) binds directly to CD40 on human B cells at a site that differs from that used by CD40 ligand. C4BP induces proliferation, upregulation of CD54 and CD86 expression, and IL4-dependent IgE isotype switching in normal B cells but not in B cells from patients with CD40 or IKKgamma/NEMO deficiencies. Furthermore, C4BP colocalized with B cells in the germinal centers of human tonsils. These observations suggest that C4BP is an activating ligand for CD40 and establish a novel interface between complement and B cell activation.",Immunity,2003
12899627,"C5L2, a nonsignaling C5A binding protein.","C5a anaphylatoxin, a potent inflammatory mediator, is known to act through a specific G protein coupled receptor. However, some of the complex effects of C5a in vivo may not be explained solely by the deletion of the known receptor. Here, we show that an orphan receptor, identified as C5L2, is a high affinity C5a binding protein. Unlike the previously described C5aR, C5L2 is obligately uncoupled from heterotrimeric G proteins, in part by virtue of an amino acid alteration in the so-called DRY sequence at the end of the third transmembrane segment. Both human and murine C5L2 bear a leucine for arginine replacement at this site. C5L2, when transfected into several cell types, is weakly phosphorylated in transfected cells following binding of C5a but does not induce significant activation of MAP kinases, mediate calcium flux, or stimulate chemotaxis. Bone marrow cells from wild type respond robustly to C5a with induction and suppression of a number of inflammation related genes. In contrast, C5a receptor deficient mice, which bear C5L2 alone, do not respond to C5a with changes in gene transcription by microarray analyses. Biophysical properties of the C5L2, including slow ligand on and off rates, absence of internalization, and relatively high affinity for the C5a des Arg metabolite, suggest that this receptor may serve to modulate C5a biological functions in vivo. Finally, in contrast to previous reports, we find absolutely no interaction of C5L2 with other anaphylatoxins C3a and C4a.",Biochemistry,2003
19200257,Cadherin-7 interacts with melanoma inhibitory activity protein and negatively modulates melanoma cell migration.,"Melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) has been identified as a small protein secreted from malignant melanoma cells, which strongly enhances melanoma cell migration and invasion. Detailed analyses performed by our group showed interaction of MIA with extracellular matrix proteins and integrin alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1 leading to cellular detachment. In this study, we identified cadherin-7 as a new MIA-binding protein using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry technology and co-immunoprecipitation. Cadherin-7 is a classical cell-cell adhesion molecule which was shown to be upregulated in malignant melanoma. We demonstrated enhanced expression of cadherin-7 in primary tumor cells compared to metastatic cells. Upregulation of cadherin-7 expression in metastatic cell lines but also downregulation of expression in cells derived from primary melanomas resulted in reduced cell migration. In addition, we speculate that MIA/cadherin-7 interaction may regulate cell-cell adhesion of malignant melanoma cells influencing the migration of the cells. Interestingly, overexpression of cadherin-7 resulted in a decreased MIA mRNA expression. In addition, MIA effects on cell migration were abrogated in cell clones overexpressing cadherin-7. In conclusion, these findings suggest that cadherin-7 regulates the expression and activity of MIA and the migration of melanoma cells playing a role in tumor development of malignant melanoma.",Cancer science,2009
943050,Calcification of the basal ganglia as a cause of levodopa-resistant parkinsonism.,"We present a patient with levodopa-resistant parkinsonism due to basal ganglia calcification related to surgically-induced hypoparathyroidism. The calcification was seen on computerized axial tomography but not on skull x-rays. Such calcification should be looked for in all cases of levodopa-resistant parkinsonism, since it is possible that treatment of hypoparathyroidism may halt progression of the disease. This case with similar ones from the literature suggest that striatal disease itself can cause parkingonism and that the parkinsonism in such patients tends to be less responsive or nonresponsive to levodopa.",,
7876141,Calnexin recognizes carbohydrate and protein determinants of class I major histocompatibility complex molecules.,"Proper folding of nascent polypeptides is essential for their function and is monitored by intracellular ""quality control"" elements. The molecular chaperone calnexin participates in this process by retaining in the endoplasmic reticulum a variety of unfolded proteins, including class I major histocompatibility complex molecules. We transfected human B cell lines with genes encoding either wild-type HLA-A2 heavy chains or mutant heavy chains lacking sites for glycosylation or deficient in binding to beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m). In CIR cells, calnexin did not associate detectably with wild-type heavy chains but bound strongly to mutant heavy chains unable to bind beta 2m. Removal of the glycosylation addition site by further mutagenesis prevented binding of mutant heavy chains to calnexin. In Daudi cells, deficient in synthesis of beta 2m, wild-type HLA-A2 heavy chains, but not a non-glycosylated mutant, bound calnexin. Castanospermine, which blocks trimming of glucose residues from asparagine-linked glycans, inhibited association of calnexin with heavy chains encoded by a second class I gene, HLA-B*0702. Although initiation of calnexin binding appears to depend on the presence of oligosaccharide on the substrate, removal of the glycan from calnexin-associated heavy chains by digestion with endoglycosidase H did not disrupt the interaction. These results suggest that calnexin first recognizes carbohydrate on substrate proteins and then binds more stably to peptide determinants, which disappear upon folding.",,
11327697,Calreticulin is directly involved in anti-alpha3 integrin antibody-mediated secretion and activation of matrix metalloprotease-2.,"Matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) plays a pivotal role in cancer invasion and metastasis. Invasive human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD) secrete proMMP-2. We recently reported that anti-alpha3 integrin antibody induced the activated form of MMP-2 and enhanced proMMP-2 secretion by RD cells with concomitant enhancement of RD cell invasion. Since recent studies showed that calreticulin interacts with integrin alpha subunit, we hypothesized that calreticulin may be involved in signal transduction of anti-alpha3 integrin antibody-mediated MMP-2 secretion and activation. Here we demonstrate that anti-alpha3 integrin antibody induced a transient enhanced interaction of calreticulin with alpha3 integrin. Transfection of antisense oligonucleotides of calreticulin in RD cells abrogated the interaction between calreticulin and alpha3 integrin, and completely suppressed activation of MMP-2 and enhanced secretion of proMMP-2 induced by anti-alpha3 integrin antibody. Transient overexpression of calreticulin cDNA in RD cells significantly increased secretion of proMMP-2. The results demonstrate for the first time that calreticulin is directly involved in MMP-2 secretion and activation.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2001
30391782,Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived IL32 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis via integrin β3-p38 MAPK signalling.,"Metastasis is the leading cause of breast cancer-related deaths. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant stromal cell type in the breast tumour microenvironment, may contribute to cancer progression through interaction with tumour cells. Nonetheless, little is known about the details of the underlying mechanism. Here we found that interaction of interleukin 32 (IL32) with integrin β3 (encoded by ITGB3; a member of the integrin family) mediating the cross-talk between CAFs and breast cancer cells plays a crucial role in CAF-induced breast tumour invasiveness. IL32, an 'RGD' motif-containing cytokine, was found to be abundantly expressed in CAFs. Integrin β3 turned out to be up-regulated in breast cancer cells during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CAF-derived IL32 specifically bound to integrin β3 through the RGD motif, thus activating intracellular downstream p38 MAPK signalling in breast cancer cells. This signalling increased the expression of EMT markers (fibronectin, N-cadherin, and vimentin) and promoted tumour cell invasion. Counteracting IL32 activity, a knockdown of IL32 or integrin β3 led to specific inactivation of p38 MAPK signalling in tumour cells. Blockage of the p38 MAPK pathway also diminished IL32-induced expression of EMT markers and breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Thus, our data indicate that CAF-secreted IL32 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis via integrin β3-p38 MAPK signalling.",,
19122641,Carcinoma-produced factors activate myeloid cells through TLR2 to stimulate metastasis.,"Metastatic progression depends on genetic alterations intrinsic to cancer cells as well as the inflammatory microenvironment of advanced tumours. To understand how cancer cells affect the inflammatory microenvironment, we conducted a biochemical screen for macrophage-activating factors secreted by metastatic carcinomas. Here we show that, among the cell lines screened, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) were the most potent macrophage activators leading to production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) through activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family members TLR2 and TLR6. Both TNF-alpha and TLR2 were found to be required for LLC metastasis. Biochemical purification of LLC-conditioned medium (LCM) led to identification of the extracellular matrix proteoglycan versican, which is upregulated in many human tumours including lung cancer, as a macrophage activator that acts through TLR2 and its co-receptors TLR6 and CD14. By activating TLR2:TLR6 complexes and inducing TNF-alpha secretion by myeloid cells, versican strongly enhances LLC metastatic growth. These results explain how advanced cancer cells usurp components of the host innate immune system, including bone-marrow-derived myeloid progenitors, to generate an inflammatory microenvironment hospitable for metastatic growth.",,
10801846,Cardiac phospholipase D2 localizes to sarcolemmal membranes and is inhibited by alpha-actinin in an ADP-ribosylation factor-reversible manner.,"Myocardial phospholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in the regulation of Ca(2+) mobilization and contractile performance in the heart. However, the molecular identity of this myocardial PLD and the mechanisms that regulate it are not well understood. Using subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis, we found that PLD2 is the major myocardial PLD and that it localizes primarily to sarcolemmal membranes. A 100-kDa PLD2-interacting cardiac protein was detected using a protein overlay assay employing purified PLD2 and then identified as alpha-actinin using peptide-mass fingerprinting with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy. The direct association between PLD2 and alpha-actinin was confirmed using an in vitro binding assay and localized to PLD2's N-terminal 185 amino acids. Purified alpha-actinin potently inhibits PLD2 activity (IC(50) = 80 nm) in an interaction-dependent and ADP-ribosylation factor-reversible manner. Finally, alpha-actinin co-localizes with actin and with PLD2 in the detergent-insoluble fraction from sarcolemmal membranes. These results suggest that PLD2 is reciprocally regulated in sarcolemmal membranes by alpha-actinin and ARF1 and accordingly that a major role for PLD2 in cardiac function may involve reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
11834704,Cardiotrophin-1 stimulation of cardiac fibroblast growth: roles for glycoprotein 130/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor and the endothelin type A receptor.,"Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a member of the interleukin-6 superfamily, and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are potent hypertrophic factors in cardiomyocytes. Although CT-1 and ET-1 gene expression in the heart is upregulated in experimental heart failure, their role in the activation of the cardiac fibroblast is unknown. This study was designed to identify the presence and action of CT-1 and its receptor complex, glycoprotein130 (gp130) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor, on cardiac fibroblast growth in cultured adult canine cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, we investigated the interaction between CT-1/gp130/LIF receptor and ET-1/endothelin type A (ET(A)) receptor axis. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the indirect immunoperoxidase method, while we assessed the cell cycle of cardiac fibroblasts by flow cytometry, DNA synthesis by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, and collagen synthesis by [(3)H]proline incorporation, respectively. CT-1 and gp130/LIF receptor were widely present in the cytoplasm of the cardiac fibroblasts. Exogenous CT-1 markedly stimulated [(3)H]thymidine and [(3)H]proline incorporations (P<0.01), with accumulation of cells in the S phase. Blockade of gp130 or LIF receptor inhibited basal growth as well as CT-1- or ET-1-stimulated cardiac fibroblast growth. The specific ET(A) receptor antagonist, BQ123, significantly inhibited CT-1-stimulated DNA synthesis. This study demonstrates that CT-1 and its receptors are present in cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, growth of these cells stimulated by endogenous and exogenous CT-1 requires gp130/LIF receptor as well as ET(A) receptor activation. We conclude that gp130/LIF receptor and ET(A) receptor activation are essential for cardiac fibroblast growth by CT-1 and that there is synergism with ET-1/ET(A) receptor axis.",Circulation research,2002

20033473,Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein promotes cell attachment via two independent mechanisms involving CD47 and alphaVbeta3 integrin.,"Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is a pentameric approximately 524 kDa multidomain extracellular matrix protein and is the fifth member of the thrombospondin family. COMP is abundantly expressed in proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate, articular cartilage, synovium, tendon, and ligament. The spatial localization of COMP highlights its importance in the phenotypes of pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), COMP disorders that are characterized by disproportionate short stature, brachydactyly, scoliosis, early-onset osteoarthritis, and joint hypermobility. In this study, the role of COMP in ligament was investigated with a series of cell attachment assays using ligament cells binding to COMP. A dose-dependent cell attachment activity was found, which was inhibited by a peptide containing the SFYVVMWK amino acid sequence derived from the globular C-terminal domain of COMP. This activity was independent of the recently described RGD-dependent attachment activity. Function-blocking antibodies to CD47 and alphaVbeta3 integrin reduced cell attachment to COMP, implicating the participation of these cell surface molecules in COMP cell binding. Immunofluorescence studies showed that cell attachment to COMP induced the formation of lamellae containing F-actin microspikes associated with fascin. We propose that COMP promotes cell attachment via two independent mechanisms involving cell surface CD47 and alphaVbeta3 integrin and that a consequence of cell attachment to COMP is the specific induction of fascin-stabilized actin microspikes.",,
9525338,Cartilage-derived morphogenetic proteins and osteogenic protein-1 differentially regulate osteogenesis.,"Cartilage-derived morphogenetic proteins-1 and -2 (CDMP-1 and CDMP-2) are members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, which play important roles in embryonic skeletal development. We studied the biological activities of recombinant CDMP-1 and CDMP-2 in chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation and investigated their binding properties to type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. In vivo, CDMP-1 and CDMP-2 were capable of inducing dose-dependently de novo cartilage and bone formation in an ectopic implantation assay. In vitro studies using primary chondrocyte cultures showed that both CDMP-1 and CDMP-2 stimulated equally de novo synthesis of proteoglycan aggrecan in a concentration-dependent manner. This activity was equipotent when compared with osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1). In contrast, CDMPs were less stimulatory than OP-1 in osteogenic differentiation as evaluated by alkaline phosphatase activity and expression levels of bone markers in ATDC5, ROB-C26, and MC3T3-E1 cells. CDMP-2 was the least osteogenic in these assays. Receptor binding studies of CDMP-1 and CDMP-2 revealed that both have affinity for the BMP receptor type IB (BMPR-IB) and BMPR-II, and weakly for BMPR-IA. Moreover, using a promoter/reporter construct, transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-IB in the presence of BMPR-II upon CDMP-1 and CDMP-2 binding. Our data show that distinct members of the BMP family differentially regulate the progression in the osteogenic lineage, and this may be due to their selective affinity for specific receptor complexes.",Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,1998
9553108,"Caveolae, plasma membrane microdomains for alpha-secretase-mediated processing of the amyloid precursor protein.","Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations where key signaling elements are concentrated. In this report, both biochemical and histochemical analyses demonstrate that the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a source of Abeta amyloid peptide, is enriched within caveolae. Caveolin-1, a principal component of caveolae, is physically associated with APP, and the cytoplasmic domain of APP directly participates in this binding. The characteristic C-terminal fragment that results from APP processing by alpha-secretase, an as yet unidentified enzyme that cleaves APP within the Abeta amyloid sequence, was also localized within these caveolae-enriched fractions. Further analysis by cell surface biotinylation revealed that this cleavage event occurs at the cell surface. Importantly, alpha-secretase processing was significantly promoted by recombinant overexpression of caveolin in intact cells, resulting in increased secretion of the soluble extracellular domain of APP. Conversely, caveolin depletion using antisense oligonucletotides prevented this cleavage event. Our current results indicate that caveolae and caveolins may play a pivotal role in the alpha-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP in vivo.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998

Subtype selectivity is determined by distinct intracellular domains.,"The CB1 cannabinoid receptor in N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells inhibits adenylate cyclase, and this response can be mimicked by a peptide corresponding to the juxtamembrane C-terminal domain (CB(1)401-417). Guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate binding to G proteins can be stimulated by both peptide CB(1)401-417 and peptides corresponding to the third intracellular loop [Howlett, A.C., Song, C., Berglund, B.A., Wilken, G.H. & Pigg, J.J.

In Chaps-solubilized N18TG2 membranes, the CB1 receptor coimmunoprecipitated with all three Gi subtypes. Pertussis toxin significantly reduced the CB(1) receptor-G alpha(i) association and attenuated the CB(1)401-417-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase. CB(1)401-417 significantly reduced the CB(1) receptor association with G alpha(i3), but not with G alpha(i1) or G alpha(i2). In contrast, third intracellular loop peptides significantly reduced the CB(1) receptor association with G alpha(i1) and G alpha(i2), but not G alpha(i3). These interactions are specific for the CB(1) receptor because a peptide corresponding to the juxtamembrane C-terminal domain of the CB(2) receptor failed to compete for the association of the CB1 receptor with any of the Gi alpha subtypes, and was not able to activate Gi proteins to inhibit adenylate cyclase. These studies indicate that different domains of the CB(1) receptor direct the interaction with specific G protein subtypes.",European journal of biochemistry,2001

CRAM is maturation-stage-dependently expressed on human B lymphocytes and its surface expression is up-regulated upon short-term CCL5 exposure. Here, we demonstrate that the homeostatic chemokine CCL19 is a specific ligand for CRAM. In radioactive labelling studies CCL19 bound to CRAM-expressing cells with an affinity similar to the described binding of its other receptor CCR7. In contrast to the known CCL19/CCR7 ligand/receptor pair, CRAM stimulation by CCL19 did not result in typical chemokine-receptor-dependent cellular activation like calcium mobilization or migration. Instead, we demonstrate that CRAM is constitutively recycling via clathrin-coated pits and able to internalize CCL19 as well as anti-CRAM antibodies. As this absence of classical chemokine receptor responses and the recycling and internalization features are characteristic for non-classical chemokine receptors, we suggest that CRAM is the newest member of this group. As CCL19 is known to be critically involved in lymphocyte and dendritic cell trafficking, CCL19-binding competition by CRAM might be involved in modulating these processes.",Immunology,2010
32533638,CCL20 is a novel ligand for the scavenging atypical chemokine receptor 4.,"The chemokine CCL20 is broadly produced by endothelial cells in the liver, the lung, in lymph nodes and mucosal lymphoid tissues, and recruits CCR6 expressing leukocytes, particularly dendritic cells, mature B cells, and subpopulations of T cells. How CCL20 is systemically scavenged is currently unknown. Here, we identify that fluorescently labeled human and mouse CCL20 are efficiently taken-up by the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR4. CCL20 shares ACKR4 with the homeostatic chemokines CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25, although with a lower affinity. We demonstrate that all 4 human chemokines recruit β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 to human ACKR4. Similarly, mouse CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 equally activate the human receptor. Interestingly, at the same chemokine concentration, mouse CCL20 did not recruit β-arrestins to human ACKR4. Further cross-species analysis suggests that human ACKR4 preferentially takes-up human CCL20, whereas mouse ACKR4 similarly internalizes mouse and human CCL20. Furthermore, we engineered a fluorescently labeled chimeric chemokine consisting of the N-terminus of mouse CCL25 and the body of mouse CCL19, termed CCL25_19, which interacts with and is taken-up by human and mouse ACKR4.",Journal of leukocyte biology,2020
11821900,CCL27-CCR10 interactions regulate T cell-mediated skin inflammation.,"The skin-associated chemokine CCL27 (also called CTACK, ALP and ESkine) and its receptor CCR10 (GPR-2) mediate chemotactic responses of skin-homing T cells in vitro. Here we report that most skin-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients suffering from psoriasis, atopic or allergic-contact dermatitis express CCR10. Epidermal basal keratinocytes produced CCL27 protein that bound to extracellular matrix, mediated adhesion and was displayed on the surface of dermal endothelial cells. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta induced CCL27 production whereas the glucocorticosteroid clobetasol propionate suppressed it. Circulating skin-homing CLA+ T cells, dermal microvascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts expressed CCR10 on their cell surface. In vivo, intracutaneous CCL27 injection attracted lymphocytes and, conversely, neutralization of CCL27-CCR10 interactions impaired lymphocyte recruitment to the skin leading to the suppression of allergen-induced skin inflammation. Together, these findings indicate that CCL27-CCR10 interactions have a pivotal role in T cell-mediated skin inflammation.",,
12718728,CCL27/PESKY: a novel paradigm for chemokine function.,"Chemokines play a central role in regulating leukocyte migration. The recently discovered CC chemokine ligand 27 (CCL27), through interaction with its cognate receptor, CC chemokine receptor 10 (CCR10), appears to be involved in attracting a subset of memory T cells to the skin during some cutaneous inflammatory responses. Strangely, CCL27 can also be produced as a non-secreted form, as a result of alternative splicing. This protein, termed PESKY, is targeted to the nucleus where it is able to modulate transcription and alter cell morphology. Specifically, PESKY induces a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, manifest by the disruption of stress fibres. This consequently enhances cell motility. Surprisingly, secreted CCL27 can also reach the nucleus after CCR10-mediated internalisation, where it may also be capable of directly modulating transcription to alter cell behaviour. This review will discuss these unprecedented findings.",,

Interaction with Gi leads to G protein activation, whereas Gq does not seem to be activated. Additionally, CCR5 activation also leads to phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). Activation of JAK2 is independent of Gi or Gq activation. Gi protein activation was not prevented by inhibition of JAK, showing that heterotrimeric G protein activation and activation of the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway are independent of each other.",FEBS letters,2004
23142580,CCN2/CTGF binds to fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 and modulates its signaling.,"CCN2 plays a critical role in the development of mesenchymal tissues such as cartilage and bone, and the binding of CCN2 to various cytokines and receptors regulates their signaling.By screening a protein array, we found that CCN2 could bind to fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) 2 and 3, with a higher affinity toward FGFR2.We ascertained that FGFR2 bound to CCN2 and that the binding of FGFR2 to FGF2 and FGF4 was enhanced by CCN2.CCN2 and FGF2 had a collaborative effect on the phosphorylation of ERK and the differentiation of osteoblastic cells.The present results indicate the biological significance of the binding of CCN2 to FGFR2 in bone metabolism.",,
29330021,"CCN4/WISP1 controls cutaneous wound healing by modulating proliferation, migration and ECM expression in dermal fibroblasts via α5β1 and TNFα.","Understanding the mechanisms that control cutaneous wound healing is crucial to successfully manage repair of damaged skin. The goal of the current study was to uncover novel extracellular matrix (ECM) components that control the wound healing process. Full thickness skin defects were created in mice and used to show CCN4 up-regulation during wound-healing as early as 1 day after surgery, suggesting a role in inflammation and subsequent dermal migration and proliferation. To determine how CCN4 could regulate wound healing we used Ccn4-KO mice and showed they had delayed wound closure accompanied by reduced expression of Col1a1 and Fn mRNA. Boyden chamber assays using Ccn4-deficient dermal fibroblasts showed they have reduced migration and proliferation compared to WT counterparts. To confirm CCN4 has a role in proliferation and migration of dermal cells, siRNA knockdown and transduction of CCN4 adenoviral transduction were used and resulted in reduced or enhanced migration of human adult dermal fibroblast (hADF) cells respectively. The induced migration of the dermal fibroblasts by CCN4 appears to work via α5β1 integrin receptors that further stimulates down-stream ERK/JNK signaling. The regulation of CCN4 by TNF-α prompted us look further at their potential relationship. Treatment of hADFs with CCN4 and TNF-α alone or together showed CCN4 counteracted the inhibition of TNF-α on COL1A1 and FN mRNA expression and the stimulation of TNF-α on MMP-1 and MMP3 mRNA expression. CCN4 appeared to counterbalance the effects of TNF-α by inhibiting downstream NF-κB/p-65 signaling. Taken together we show CCN4 stimulates dermal fibroblast cell migration, proliferation and inhibits TNF-α stimulation, all of which could regulate wound healing.",,
10734104,CCR11 is a functional receptor for the monocyte chemoattractant protein family of chemokines.,"Chemokines mediate their diverse activities through G protein-coupled receptors. The human homolog of the bovine orphan receptor PPR1 shares significant similarity to chemokine receptors. Transfection of this receptor into murine L1.2 cells resulted in responsiveness to monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-4, MCP-2, and MCP-1 in chemotaxis assays. Binding studies with radiolabeled MCP-4 demonstrated a single high affinity binding site with an IC(50) of 0.14 nM. As shown by competition binding, other members of the MCP family also recognized this receptor. MCP-2 was the next most potent ligand, with an IC(50) of 0.45 nM. Surprisingly, eotaxin (IC(50) = 6.7 nM) and MCP-3 (IC(50) = 4.1 nM) bind with greater affinity than MCP-1 (IC(50) = 10.7 nM) but only act as agonists in chemotaxis assays at 100-fold higher concentrations. Because of high affinity binding and functional chemotactic responses, we have termed this receptor CCR11. The gene for CCR11 was localized to human chromosome 3q22, which is distinct from most CC chemokine receptor genes at 3p21. Northern blot hybridization was used to identify CCR11 expression in heart, small intestine, and lung. Thus CCR11 shares functional similarity to CCR2 because it recognizes members of the MCP family, but CCR11 has a distinct expression pattern.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
12884299,"CCR3 functional responses are regulated by both CXCR3 and its ligands CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11.","The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is predominantly expressed on T lymphocytes, and its agonists CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 are IFN-gamma-inducible chemokines that promote Th1 responses. In contrast, the CCR3 agonists CCL11, CCL24 and CCL26 are involved in the recruitment of cells such as eosinophils and basophils during Th2 responses. Here, we report that although CCL11, CCL24 and CCL26 are neither agonists nor antagonists of CXCR3, CCL11 binds with high affinity to CXCR3. This suggests that, in vivo, CXCR3 may act as a decoy receptor, sequestering locally produced CCL11. We also demonstrate that the CXCR3 ligands inhibit CCR3-mediated functional responses of both human eosinophils and CCR3 transfectants induced by all three eotaxins, with CXCL11 being the most efficacious antagonist. The examination of CCR3-CCR1 chimeric constructs revealed that CCL11 and CXCL11 share overlapping binding sites contained within the CCR3 extracellular loops, a region that was previously shown to be essential for effective receptor-activation. Hence, eosinophil responses mediated by chemokines acting at CCR3 may be regulated by two distinct mechanisms: the antagonistic effects of CXCR3 ligands and the sequestration of CCL11 by CXCR3-expressing cells. Such interplay may serve to finely tune inflammatory responses in vivo.",European journal of immunology,2003
10477718,CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist.,"CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.",Blood,1999
9790730,CCR5 has an expanded ligand-binding repertoire and is the primary receptor used by MCP-2 on activated T cells.,"CCR5 is a chemokine receptor expressed by T cells and macrophages, which also functions as the principal coreceptor for macrophage (M)-tropic HIV-1 strains to enter the host cells. In this study, we aim to better understand the ligand-binding profiles of CCR5 and the chemokine-receptor usage on leukocyte cells. We found that MCP-2 could bind to CCR5 transfectants with high affinity and cross-compete effectively with RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta. MCP-2 is a true agonist for CCR5, eliciting a robust chemotactic response in CCR5 transfectants similar to that of the three known CCR5 ligands and exhibiting cross-desensitization with RANTES in the Ca2+ flux response. MCP-4 also bound to CCR5 with high affinity and was efficiently displaced by other CCR5 ligands. However, MCP-4 only partially displaced the binding of radiolabeled MIP-1alpha and caused a chemotactic response only at high concentrations. Furthermore, MCP-2 inhibited the binding of the M-tropic HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein to CCR5 and HIV-1 infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. More importantly, we found that MCP-2 could bind and elicit chemotaxis in CD3-activated and IL-2-maintained T cells, and most of these functions could be specifically inhibited by the anti-CCR5 mAb 2D7, whereas the responses mediated by MIP-1alpha or MCP-4 were only partially inhibited by 2D7. Thus, although MCP-2 can bind to and signal through CCR1, CCR2b, and CCR5, among which both CCR2 and CCR5 are expressed at high levels on activated T cells, it appears to preferably utilize CCR5 on these cells. In contrast, MIP-1alpha and MCP-4 seem to activate multiple receptors on the same cells.",,
12645948,CCR8-dependent activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway mediates anti-apoptotic activity of I-309/ CCL1 and vMIP-I.,"We have previously shown that the CC-chemokine 1-309 (CCL1) protects mouse thymic lymphomas against corticoid-induced apoptosis. Here, we analyzed the signal transduction pathways involved in this activity on BW5147 lymphoma. Inhibition of the CCL1 activity by pertussis toxin suggested the involvement of a G protein-coupled chemokine receptor. The role of CCR8 was supported by the observation that vMIP-I, another CCR8-ligand identified from the genome of a T cell transforming herpes virus, shared CCL1 anti-apoptotic activity. In addition to CCR8, BW5147 cells also expressed the CXCR4 receptor but its ligand, SDF-1 (CXCL12) showed only a modest anti-apoptotic activity. Other chemokines acting on CCR2, CCR4 and CCR5 failed to protect against apoptosis and to induce BW5147 chemotaxis, suggesting that these receptors were not functionally expressed. By contrast, both CCL1 and vMIP-I up-regulated ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation in BW5147 cells. Further analysis demonstrated that CCL1 activates the MAPK pathway in CCR8-transfected CHO cells. The implication of this pathway was confirmed by the fact that PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK kinases, as well as a dominant negative isoform of the M-RAS protein specifically blocked the anti-apoptotic activity of CCL1.",European journal of immunology,2003
32149455,CD11b is a novel alternate receptor for CD154 during alloimmunity.,"Antagonism of the CD154/CD40 pathway is a highly effective means of inducing long-term graft survival in preclinical models. Using a fully allogeneic murine transplant model, we found that CD154 blockade was more effective in prolonging graft survival than was CD40 blockade, raising the possibility that CD154 binds a second receptor. To test this, we queried the impact of CD154 antagonism in the absence of CD40. Data indicated that anti-CD154 functioned to reduce graft-infiltrating CD8",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2020
17274987,CD14 is a ligand for the integrin alpha4beta1.,"Cell adhesion mediated by the integrin alpha4beta1 plays a key role in many biological processes reflecting both the number and functional significance of alpha4beta1 ligands. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor, CD14, is a GPI-linked cell surface glycoprotein with a wide range of reported functions and associations, some of which overlap with that of alpha4beta1. This overlap led us to test the specific hypothesis that alpha4beta1 and CD14 interact directly. Jurkat T cells (alpha4beta1(+)) were found to adhere to a recombinant CD14-Fc protein via alpha4beta1, whilst K562 cells (alpha4beta1(-)) did not. However, stable reexpression of the alpha4-subunit conferred this ability. The adhesion of both cell types to CD14 displayed activation state-dependent binding very similar to the interaction of alpha4beta1 with its prototypic ligand, VCAM-1. In solid-phase assays, CD14-Fc bound to affinity-purified alpha4beta1 in a dose-dependent manner that was induced by activating anti-beta1 mAbs. Finally, in related experiments, JY cells (alpha4beta7(+)) were also found to attach to CD14-Fc in an alpha4-dependent manner. In summary, CD14 is a novel ligand for alpha4beta1, exhibiting similar activation-state dependent binding characteristics as other alpha4beta1 ligands. The biological relevance of this interaction will be the subject of further studies.",FEBS letters,2007
25656845,CD146 acts as a novel receptor for netrin-1 in promoting angiogenesis and vascular development.,"Angiogenesis, a process that newly-formed blood vessels sprout from pre-existing ones, is vital for vertebrate development and adult homeostasis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the neuronal guidance molecule netrin-1 participates in angiogenesis and morphogenesis of the vascular system. Netrin-1 exhibits dual activities in angiogenesis: either promoting or inhibiting angiogenesis. The anti-angiogenic activity of netrin-1 is mediated by UNC5B receptor. However, how netrin-1 promotes angiogenesis remained unclear. Here we report that CD146, an endothelial transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is a receptor for netrin-1. Netrin-1 binds to CD146 with high affinity, inducing endothelial cell activation and downstream signaling in a CD146-dependent manner. Conditional knockout of the cd146 gene in the murine endothelium or disruption of netrin-CD146 interaction by a specific anti-CD146 antibody blocks or reduces netrin-1-induced angiogenesis. In zebrafish embryos, downregulating either netrin-1a or CD146 results in vascular defects with striking similarity. Moreover, knocking down CD146 blocks ectopic vascular sprouting induced by netrin-1 overexpression. Together, our data uncover CD146 as a previously unknown receptor for netrin-1 and also reveal a functional ligand for CD146 in angiogenesis, demonstrating the involvement of netrin-CD146 signaling in angiogenesis during vertebrate development.",Cell research,2015
33747748,CD146 is a Novel ANGPTL2 Receptor that Promotes Obesity by Manipulating Lipid Metabolism and Energy Expenditure.,"Obesity and its related complications pose an increasing threat to human health; however, targetable obesity-related membrane receptors are not yet elucidated. Here, the membrane receptor CD146 is demonstrated to play an essential role in obesity. In particular, CD146 acts as a new adipose receptor for angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2), which is thought to act on endothelial cells to activate adipose inflammation. ANGPTL2 binds to CD146 to activate cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which then upregulates CD146 during adipogenesis and adipose inflammation. CD146 is present in preadipocytes and mature adipocytes, where it is mediated by its ligands ANGPTL2 and galectin-1. In preadipocytes, CD146 ablation suppresses adipogenesis, whereas the loss of CD146 in mature adipocytes suppresses lipid accumulation and enhances energy expenditure. Moreover, anti-CD146 antibodies inhibit obesity by disrupting the interactions between CD146 and its ligands. Together, these findings demonstrate that ANGPTL2 directly affects adipocytes via CD146 to promote obesity, suggesting that CD146 can be a potential target for treating obesity.",,

15187158,CD200 is a ligand for all members of the CD200R family of immunoregulatory molecules.,"CD200Fc, a chimeric molecule including the extracellular domain of CD200 and a murine IgG2a Fc region, regulates immune responses following engagement of a cell surface receptor, CD200R, expressed on cells of the myeloid and T cell lineage. A recent report focused attention on a family of CD200Rs, but concluded that only one member used CD200 as its ligand. We have also cloned and sequenced a family of CD200Rs, but identify an amino terminus to two of the three isoforms not recognized by previous researchers. We show by FACS, using FITC-labeled CD200Fc, that COS7 cells transfected with all CD200R isoforms bind CD200 as ligand, although the functional consequences of this binding likely differs between the different isoforms. mAbs directed against the CD200 R1/R4 isoforms altered IL-2/IL-4 cytokine production and suppressed CTL responses in a fashion comparable to CD200Fc, with a significantly lesser effect seen following addition of anti-CD200 R2/R3.",,
22020332,CD200-CD200R signaling suppresses anti-tumor responses independently of CD200 expression on the tumor.,"Expression of CD200, the gene encoding the ligand for the inhibitory immune receptor CD200R, is an independent prognostic factor for various forms of leukemia predicting worse overall survival of the patients. The enhanced expression of CD200 on the tumors implies that anti-tumor responses can be enhanced by blockage of the CD200-CD200R interaction. Indeed, antibody-mediated blockade of the CD200-CD200R inhibitory axis is currently evaluated in clinical tests to boost immune responses against CD200-expressing tumors. Here, we show that mice lacking CD200, the exclusive ligand for CD200R, are resistant to chemical skin carcinogenesis. Importantly, CD200R controls tumor outgrowth independently of CD200 expression by the tumor cells themselves. Furthermore, Cd200(-/-) mice do not become tolerant to intranasally administered antigens, suggesting that tumor rejection is normally suppressed through CD200-induced immune tolerance. Decreased tumor outgrowth is accompanied by increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 by the lymph node (LN) dendritic cells. During carcinogenesis, skin-draining LNs of Cd200(-/-) mice contain increased numbers of IL-17-producing FoxP3(+) cells, which preferentially home to the tumors. Thus, the CD200-CD200R axis induces tolerance to external and tumor antigens and influences the T-regulatory/Th17 cell ratio. We demonstrate for the first time that the absence of CD200R signaling inhibits outgrowth of an endogenous tumor irrespective of CD200 expression by the tumor cells. This important paradigm shift leads to a much broader applicability of CD200-blockade in the treatment of tumors.",,
15905546,CD229 (Ly9) lymphocyte cell surface receptor interacts homophilically through its N-terminal domain and relocalizes to the immunological synapse.,"CD229 is a member of the CD150 family of the Ig superfamily expressed on T and B cells. Receptors of this family regulate cytokine production and cytotoxicity of lymphocytes and NK cells. The cytoplasmic tail of CD229 binds to SAP, a protein that is defective in X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome. To identify the CD229 ligand, we generated a soluble Ig fusion protein containing the two N-terminal extracellular domains of human CD229 (CD229-Ig). CD229-Ig bound to CD229-transfected cells, whereas no binding was detected on cells expressing other CD150 family receptors, showing that CD229 binds homophilically. Both human and mouse CD229 interacted with itself. Domain deletion mutants showed that the N-terminal Ig-domain mediates homophilic adhesion. CD229-CD229 binding was severely compromised when the charged amino acids E27 and E29 on the predicted B-C loop and R89 on the F-G loop of the N-terminal domain were mutated to alanine. In contrast, one mutation, R44A, enhanced the homophilic interaction. Confocal microscopy image analysis revealed relocalization of CD229 to the contact area of T and B cells during Ag-dependent immune synapse formation. Thus, CD229 is its own ligand and participates in the immunological synapse.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2005
19264983,CD24 and Siglec-10 selectively repress tissue damage-induced immune responses.,"Patten recognition receptors, which recognize pathogens or components of injured cells (danger), trigger activation of the innate immune system. Whether and how the host distinguishes between danger- versus pathogen-associated molecular patterns remains unresolved. We report that CD24-deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to danger- but not pathogen-associated molecular patterns. CD24 associates with high mobility group box 1, heat shock protein 70, and heat shock protein 90; negatively regulates their stimulatory activity; and inhibits nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. This occurs at least in part through CD24 association with Siglec-10 in humans or Siglec-G in mice. Our results reveal that the CD24-Siglec G pathway protects the host against a lethal response to pathological cell death and discriminates danger- versus pathogen-associated molecular patterns.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2009

9129046,"CD24, a mucin-type glycoprotein, is a ligand for P-selectin on human tumor cells.","P-selectin (CD62P) is a Ca2+-dependent endogenous lectin that can be expressed by vascular endothelium and platelets. The major ligand for P-selectin on leukocytes is P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). P-selectin can also bind to carcinoma cells, but the nature of the ligand(s) on these cells is unknown. Here we investigated the P-selectin binding to a breast and a small cell lung carcinoma cell line that are negative for PSGL-1. We report that CD24, a mucin-type glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface molecule on human neutrophils, pre B lymphocytes, and many tumors can promote binding to P-selectin. Latex beads coated with purified CD24 from the two carcinoma cell lines but also neutrophils could bind specifically to P-selectin-IgG. The binding was dependent on divalent cations and was abolished by treatment with O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase but not endoglycosidase F or sialidase. The beads were stained with a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to CD57 (HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope) but did not react with MoAbs against the sialylLe(x/a) epitope. The carcinoma cells and CD24-beads derived from these cells could bind to activated platelets or P-selectin transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (P-CHO) in a P-selectin-dependent manner and this binding was blocked by soluble CD24. Transfection of human adenocarcinoma cells with CD24 enhanced the P-selectin-dependent binding to activated platelets. Treatment of the carcinoma cells or the CD24 transfectant with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C reduced CD24 expression and P-selectin-IgG binding concomitantly. These results establish a role of CD24 as a novel ligand for P-selectin on tumor cells. The CD24/P-selectin binding pathway could be important in the dissimination of tumor cells by facilitating the interaction with platelets or endothelial cells.",Blood,1997
8580829,CD27-CD70 interaction: unravelling its implication in normal and neoplastic B-cell growth.,"Members of the Tumour Necrosis Factor-Receptor (TNFR) family play an essential role in the control of lymphoid cell growth and differentiation. The ligand of one of its lymphoid-specific members, CD27, was recently characterized as CD70, a type II transmembrane molecule with homology to TNF that is expressed on activated T and B cells. Ligation of CD27 by its natural ligand generates a potent costimulatory signal for cytokine production and proliferation of activated T cells. In contrast to normal B cells, where CD27 expression is confined to germinal centre cells and to a small subset of circulating B lymphocytes, CD27 expression is found on a large array of distinct B-cell neoplasia. Here, we review recent data on the expression and function of TNFR family members on normal and malignant lymphocytes and propose a role for CD27-CD70 interaction in B-cell development.",,

CD27 is expressed on resting T and B cells, whereas CD70 is expressed on activated T and B cells. Utilizing transfected murine pre-B-cell lines expressing human CD27 or CD70, we have examined the effect of such transfectant cells on human B-cell IgG production and B-cell proliferation. We show that the addition of CD27-transfected cells to a T-cell-dependent, pokeweed mitogen-driven B-cell IgG synthesis system resulted in marked inhibition of IgG production, whereas the addition of CD70-transfected cells enhanced IgG production. The inhibition and enhancement of pokeweed mitogen-driven IgG production by CD27 and CD70 transfectants were abrogated by pretreatment with anti-CD27 and anti-CD70 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. In contrast, little or no inhibition of IgG production and B-cell proliferation was noted with CD27-transfected cells or either anti-CD27 or CD70 monoclonal antibody in a T-cell-independent Staphylococcus aureus/interleukin 2-driven B-cell activation system. In this same system CD70-transfected cells enhanced B-cell IgG production and B-cell proliferation, and this enhancement could be gradually abrogated by addition of increasing numbers of CD27-transfected cells. These results clearly demonstrate that interactions among subsets of T cells expressing CD27 and CD70 play a key role in regulating B-cell activation and immunoglobulin synthesis.",,
9862673,CD27/CD70 interaction augments IgE secretion by promoting the differentiation of memory B cells into plasma cells.,"The induction of IgE switching in B cells requires several signals given by cytokines and cell contact-delivered signals. Here, we investigated the role of CD27/CD70 interaction in B cell IgE synthesis. The addition of CD27 ligand (CD70) transfectants to B cell cultures increased the IgE synthesis synergistically in the presence of IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb (anti-CD40). The effect of CD70 transfectants was dose dependent and was completely blocked by anti-CD70 mAb. CD27+ B cells had the ability to produce IgE, which was increased by contact with CD70 transfectants, whereas CD27- B cells did not produce IgE. CD27/CD70 interaction enhanced B cell proliferation in the presence of IL-4 or IL-4 plus anti-CD40. The augmentation of B cell proliferation by CD70 transfectants was apparent in CD27+ B cells, but was mild in CD27- B cells. The helper activity for IgE synthesis by the CD27/CD70 interaction did not contribute to the enhancement of germline epsilon transcripts. Flow cytometric and morphological analyses demonstrated that the addition of CD70 transfectants to B cell cultures remarkably promoted differentiation into plasma cells in the presence of IL-4 and CD40 signaling. Finally, CD27 cross-linking resulted in the up-regulation of positive regulatory domain I-binding factor-1. Taken together, our findings indicate that signaling via CD27 on B cells induces IgE synthesis, in cooperation with IL-4 and CD40 signaling, by promoting the generation of plasma cells through up-regulation of positive regulatory domain I-binding factor-1.",,
8391931,"CD30 antigen, a marker for Hodgkin's lymphoma, is a receptor whose ligand defines an emerging family of cytokines with homology to TNF.","CD30 is a surface marker for neoplastic cells of Hodgkin's lymphoma and shows sequence homology to members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. Using a chimeric probe consisting of the extracellular domain of CD30 fused to truncated immunoglobulin heavy chains, we expression cloned the cDNA cognate from the murine T cell clone 7B9. The encoded protein is a 239 amino acid type II membrane protein whose C-terminal domain shows significant homology to TNF alpha, TNF beta, and the CD40L. Cross-hybridization to an induced peripheral blood T cell cDNA library yielded the human homolog, which is 72% identical at the amino acid level. The recombinant human ligand enhances the proliferation of CD3-activated T cells yet induces differential responses, including cell death, in several CD30+ lymphoma-derived clones. The human and murine genes map to 9q33 and the proximal region of chromosome 4, respectively.",Cell,1993
20075072,CD36 is a novel serum amyloid A (SAA) receptor mediating SAA binding and SAA-induced signaling in human and rodent cells.,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a major acute phase protein involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. This study provides experimental evidence that CD36, a phagocyte class B scavenger receptor, functions as a novel SAA receptor mediating SAA proinflammatory activity. The uptake of Alexa Fluor 488 SAA as well as of other well established CD36 ligands was increased 5-10-fold in HeLa cells stably transfected with CD36 when compared with mock-transfected cells. Unlike other apolipoproteins that bind to CD36, only SAA induced a 10-50-fold increase of interleukin-8 secretion in CD36-overexpressing HEK293 cells when compared with control cells. SAA-mediated effects were thermolabile, inhibitable by anti-SAA antibody, and also neutralized by association with high density lipoprotein but not by association with bovine serum albumin. SAA-induced cell activation was inhibited by a CD36 peptide based on the CD36 hexarelin-binding site but not by a peptide based on the thrombospondin-1-binding site. A pronounced reduction (up to 60-75%) of SAA-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion was observed in cd36(-/-) rat macrophages and Kupffer cells when compared with wild type rat cells. The results of the MAPK phosphorylation assay as well as of the studies with NF-kappaB and MAPK inhibitors revealed that two MAPKs, JNK and to a lesser extent ERK1/2, primarily contribute to elevated cytokine production in CD36-overexpressing HEK293 cells. In macrophages, four signaling pathways involving NF-kappaB and three MAPKs all appeared to contribute to SAA-induced cytokine release. These observations indicate that CD36 is a receptor mediating SAA binding and SAA-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion predominantly through JNK- and ERK1/2-mediated signaling.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2010
1851800,CD4-mediated stimulation of human eosinophils: lymphocyte chemoattractant factor and other CD4-binding ligands elicit eosinophil migration.,"Lymphocyte chemoattractant factor (LCF) is a tetrameric glycoprotein of 56,000 relative molecular mass produced by activated T lymphocytes. LCF binds to CD4 and has previously been found to stimulate migration of CD4+ lymphocytes and monocytes. Because human eosinophils, like T cells and monocytes, express CD4, we examined functional responses of eosinophils to LCF. Recombinant LCF (rLCF) expressed in COS cells was purified on a CD4 affinity column. Migration of eosinophils was elicited by rLCF at low concentrations: the 50% effective dose (ED50) was 10(-12) to 10(-11) M, concentrations 100- to 1,000-fold lower than the ED50s for the recognized eosinophil chemoattractants C5a and platelet-activating factor. Two other ligands which bound to CD4, human immunodeficiency virus-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 and monoclonal antibody OKT4, also stimulated eosinophil migration. Monovalent OKT4 Fab competitively inhibited eosinophil responses to rLCF. rLCF did not influence other functional responses of eosinophils tested, including degranulation, superoxide generation, leukotriene C4 production, in vitro survival, or surface expression of the adherence receptor CR3 (CD11b), human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen DR, or interleukin 2 receptor p55 (CD25). We conclude that CD4 on eosinophils is capable of transducing a migratory stimulus and serves as a receptor for a chemoattractant lymphokine LCF. T cell-derived LCF may contribute to recruitment of eosinophils and CD4+ mononuclear cells concomitantly at inflammatory reactions.",,
10647992,CD40-CD40 ligand.,"CD40 is a cell surface receptor that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor-R (TNF-R) family, and that was first identified and functionally characterized on B lymphocytes. Its critical role in T cell-dependent humoral immune responses was demonstrated by patients with the hyper-IgM syndrome, as well as by gene targeting in mice. However, in recent years it has become clear that CD40 is expressed much more broadly, including expression on monocytes, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. In addition, the CD40-ligand (CD40-L/CD154), a member of the TNF family, is also expressed more widely than activated CD4+ T cells only. Therefore it is now thought that CD40-CD40-L interactions play a more general role in immune regulation. Collectively these studies have culminated in pre-clinical and clinical studies that are in progress. This article reviews recent developments in this field of research, with main emphasis on (1) structure and expression of CD40 and its ligand; (2) CD40 signal transduction; (3) in vitro function of CD40 on different cell types; and (4) in vivo functions of CD40/CD40-L interactions.",,
1683685,"CD43, a molecule defective in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, binds ICAM-1.","THE protein CD43 (also known as sialophorin, leukosialin, large sialoglycoprotein or gp115) is expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, platelets and some B lymphocytes. Expression of CD43 is deficient and/or defective in the X-chromosome-linked immunodeficiency disorder Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome, suggesting that CD43 might have a role in T-cell activation. We have shown that expression of human CD43 in an HLA-DR-specific murine T-cell hybridoma enhances the antigen-specific response to stimulation by the human lymphoblastoid cell line Daudi, and that Daudi cells bind specifically to purified immobilized CD43. These data indicate that the specific interaction of CD43 with a ligand on the surface of Daudi cells might contribute to T-cell activation. Here we report evidence that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, or CD54), is a ligand for CD43.",,
11825873,CD44 anchors the assembly of matrilysin/MMP-7 with heparin-binding epidermal growth factor precursor and ErbB4 and regulates female reproductive organ remodeling.,"CD44 is a facultative proteoglycan implicated in cell adhesion and trafficking, as well as in tumor survival and progression. We demonstrate here that CD44 heparan sulfate proteoglycan (CD44HSPG) recruits proteolytically active matrix metalloproteinase 7 (matrilysin, MMP-7) and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor precursor (pro-HB-EGF) to form a complex on the surface of tumor cell lines, postpartum uterine and lactating mammary gland epithelium, and uterine smooth muscle. The HB-EGF precursor within this complex is processed by MMP-7, and the resulting mature HB-EGF engages and activates its receptor, ErbB4, leading to, among other events, cell survival. In CD44(-/-) mice, postpartum uterine involution is accelerated and maintenance of lactation is impaired. In both uterine and mammary epithelia of these mice, MMP-7 localization is altered and pro-HB-EGF processing as well as ErbB4 activation are decreased. Our observations provide a mechanism for the assembly and function of a cell surface complex composed of CD44HSPG, MMP 7, HB-EGF, and ErbB4 that may play an important role in the regulation of physiological tissue remodeling.",,
17912438,CD44 crosslinking-mediated matrix metalloproteinase-9 relocation in breast tumor cells leads to enhanced metastasis.,"CD44 plays a major role in multiple physiological processes, including cell-cell adhesion, cell-substrate interaction, lymphocyte homing, and tumor metastasis. It has been reported that highly expressed CD44 in certain types of tumors is associated with the hematogenic spread of tumor cells. The ability of CD44 to bind hyaluronan has been shown to correlate with tumor cell invasiveness, and it is likely that this ability may enhance tumor cell migration at several points during metastasis. However, the mechanism as to how CD44 stimulates metastasis remains unknown. The human breast tumor cell line, MDA-MB-435s, was used to investigate the effect of antibody-mediated CD44 crosslinking on the cellular level and localization of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Confocal microscopy and immunocytochemical analyses were performed to demonstrate colocalization of CD44 and MMP-9 after CD44 crosslinking. Furthermore, the CD44-MMP-9 complex was purified by immunoprecipitation. G8 myoblast monolayers were employed to evaluate the invasiveness of human breast tumor cells after CD44 crosslinking in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. CD44 crosslinking augmented the level of MMP-9 in the membrane of human breast tumor cells and clustering of CD44 serves as an MMP-9 docking molecule allowing MMP-9 to retain its concentrated proteolytic activity on the cell surface. Furthermore, crosslinking of CD44 enhances the ability of breast tumor cells to invade G8 myoblast monolayers and migrate through the basal membranes which was inhibited in the presence of anti-MMP-9 antibody or the MMP inhibitors GM6001 or 1,10-phenanthroline. This study demonstrates for the first time that CD44 crosslinking leads to an enhanced level and relocation of MMP-9 in human breast tumor cells accompanied by increased tumor invasion and metastasis.",International journal of oncology,2007
11402070,CD44 is a major E-selectin ligand on human hematopoietic progenitor cells.,"E-selectin plays a critical role in mediating tissue-specific homing of T cells into skin, and of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) into bone marrow (BM). Though it is known that a glycoform of PSGL-1 (CLA) functions as the principal E-selectin ligand on human T lymphocytes, the E-selectin ligand(s) of human HPCs has not been identified. We used a shear-based adherence assay to analyze and define the E-selectin ligand activity of membrane proteins from human HPCs. Our data show that PSGL-1 expressed on human HPCs is an E-selectin ligand, and that HPCs also express a previously unrecognized E-selectin ligand, CD44. The E-selectin ligand activity of CD44 is conferred by the elaboration of sialylated, fucosylated binding determinants on N-glycans. This glycoform of CD44 is expressed on primitive CD34+ human HPCs, but not on more mature hematopoietic cells. Under physiologic flow conditions, this molecule mediates E-selectin-dependent rolling interactions over a wider shear range than that of PSGL-1, and promotes human HPC rolling interactions on E-selectin expressed on human BM endothelial cells. These findings offer new insights into the structural biology and physiology of CD44, and into the molecular basis of E-selectin-dependent adhesive interactions that direct homing of human HPC to BM.",The Journal of cell biology,2001
1694723,CD44 is the principal cell surface receptor for hyaluronate.,"CD44 is a broadly distributed cell surface protein thought to mediate cell attachment to extracelular matrix components or specific cell surface ligands. We have created soluble CD44-immunoglobulin fusion proteins and characterized their reactivity with tissue sections and lymph node high endothelial cells in primary culture. The CD44 target on high endothelial cells is sensitive to enzymes that degrade hyaluronate, and binding of soluble CD44 is blocked by low concentrations of hyaluronate or high concentrations of chondroitin 4- and 6-sulfates. A mouse anti-hamster hyaluonate receptor antibody reacts with COS cells expressing hamster CD44 cDNA. In sections of all tissues examined, including lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, predigestion with hyaluronidase eliminated CD44 binding.",,
7532176,CD44 isoforms containing exon V3 are responsible for the presentation of heparin-binding growth factor.,"Glycosaminoglycan-modified isoforms of CD44 have been implicated in growth factor presentation at sites of inflammation. In the present study we show that COS cell transfectants expressing CD44 isoforms containing the alternatively spliced exon V3 are modified with heparan sulfate (HS). Binding studies with three HS-binding growth factors, basic-fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), heparin binding-epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), and amphiregulin, showed that the HS-modified CD44 isoforms are able to bind to b-FGF and HB-EGF, but not AR. b-FGF and HB-EGF binding to HS-modified CD44 was eliminated by pretreating the protein with heparitinase or by blocking with free heparin. HS-modified CD44 immunoprecipitated from keratinocytes, which express a CD44 isoform containing V3, also bound to b-FGF. We examined whether HS-modified CD44 isoforms were expressed by activated endothelial cells where they might present HS-binding growth factors to leukocytes during an inflammatory response. PCR and antibody-binding studies showed that activated cultured endothelial cells only express the CD44H isoform which does not contain any of the variably spliced exons including V3. Immunohistological studies with antibodies directed to CD44 extracellular domains encoded by the variably spliced exons showed that vascular endothelial cells in inflamed skin tissue sections do not express CD44 spliced variants. Keratinocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells in the same specimens were found to express variably spliced CD44. 35SO4(-2)-labeling experiments demonstrated that activated cultured endothelial cells do not express detectable levels of chondroitin sulfate or HS-modified CD44. Our results suggest that one of the functions of CD44 isoforms expressing V3 is to bind and present a subset of HS-binding proteins. Furthermore, it is probable that HS-modified CD44 is involved in the presentation of HS-binding proteins by keratinocytes in inflamed skin. However, our data suggests that CD44 is not likely to be the proteoglycan principally involved in presenting HS-binding growth factors to leukocytes on the vascular cell wall.",The Journal of cell biology,1995
1378450,CD66 nonspecific cross-reacting antigens are involved in neutrophil adherence to cytokine-activated endothelial cells.,"Neutrophil adherence to cytokine-activated endothelial cell (EC) monolayers depends on the expression of the endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1). The ligand for ELAM-1 is the sialylated Lewis-x antigen (SLe(x)) structure. The selectin LAM-1 (or LECAM-1) has been described as one of the SLe(x)-presenting glycoproteins involved in neutrophil binding to ELAM-1. Other presenter molecules have not yet been described. Our data demonstrate that the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-like surface molecules on neutrophils--known as the nonspecific cross-reacting antigens (NCAs)--are involved in neutrophil adherence to monolayers of IL-1-beta-activated EC. The NCAs are recognized by CD66 (NCA-160 and NCA-90) and CD67 (NCA-95). Because NCA-95 and NCA-90 have previously been found to be phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) neutrophils (which lack PI-linked surface proteins) were tested as well. PNH neutrophils showed a diminished binding to activated EC. CD66 (on PNH cells still recognizing the transmembrane NCA-160 form) still inhibited the adherence of PNH cells to IL-1-beta-activated EC, but to a limited extent. Soluble CEA(-related) antigens inhibited normal neutrophil adherence as well, whereas neutrophil transmigration was unaffected. Sialidase-treatment as well as CD66 preclearing abolished the inhibitory capacity of the CEA(-related) antigens. The binding of soluble CEA antigens to IL-1-beta-pretreated EC was blocked by anti-ELAM-1. These soluble antigens, as well as the neutrophil NCA-160 and NCA-90, both recognized by CD66 antibodies, presented the SLe(x) determinant. Together, these findings indicate that the CD66 antigens (i.e., NCA-160/NCA-90) function as presenter molecules of the SLe(x) oligosaccharide structures on neutrophils that bind to ELAM-1 on EC.",,
8186199,CD70 represents the human ligand for CD27.,"The recently identified CD27 ligand (L) is a type II transmembrane molecule with significant structural homology to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, TNF-beta, lymphotoxin beta, CD40L, and CD30L. Using a CD27L specific mAb we examined the tissue distribution of the molecule, and found its expression to be restricted to B cells in occasional germinal centers, stromal cells in the thymic medulla, and scattered T cells in tonsils, skin and gut. As the limited expression of CD27L closely resembled the reported distribution of the activation antigen CD70, we tested whether CD70 represents the human CD27L. CD70 mAb were found to react with CD27L-expressing transfected mouse fibroblasts. Moreover a number of CD70 mAb could specifically interfere with the cellular binding of CD27L mAb. Thus, CD70 is identical to the human CD27L.",,

11564780,CD84 functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule and enhances IFN-gamma secretion: adhesion is mediated by Ig-like domain 1.,"CD84 is a member of the CD2 subset of the Ig superfamily of cell surface molecules. Its cytoplasmic tail binds to Src homology 2 domain-containing protein 1A (signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-associated protein), a protein encoded by the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease gene. It is preferentially expressed on B lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets. We show that it is also expressed on thymocytes and T cells. CD84 was positive on CD4-CD8- thymocytes, and its expression decreased with cell maturation. It is expressed on mature T cells preferentially on CD45RO+. To identify the CD84 ligand, we generated a soluble Ig fusion protein containing the human CD84 extracellular domains (CD84-Ig). Because receptor-ligand interactions occur between several members of this subfamily, we assayed CD84-Ig binding with all members of the CD2 family. CD84-Ig bound to CD84-transfected cells, whereas no binding was detected with cells expressing other CD2 subfamily receptors, showing that CD84 binds to itself. Anti-CD84 mAbs recognizing epitopes wholly within domain 1 of CD84 blocked the binding of the CD84-Ig fusion protein to CD84-transfected cells and platelets. Data from CD84 domain human/mouse chimeras further revealed that only the first extracellular domain of the molecule is involved in the ligand receptor recognition. The CD84-CD84 interaction was independent of its cytoplasmic tail. Finally, concurrent ligation of human CD84 with mAbs or CD84-Ig and CD3 enhanced IFN-gamma secretion in human lymphocytes. Thus, CD84 is its own ligand and acts as a costimulatory molecule.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2001
11735113,CD9 amino acids critical for upregulation of diphtheria toxin binding.,"CD9 associates with a diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) that is identical to the membrane-anchored form of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor. We determined the region of CD9 important for upregulation activity. Human and monkey CD9 upregulates DT binding activity of DTR, while mouse CD9 has no upregulation activity. Transfection of chimeric constructs comprising monkey and mouse CD9s showed that the human sequence between Ala156 and Asp183 is essential for the upregulation activity. Studies of mutants, replacing a single amino acid within the region between Ala156 and Asp183 of monkey CD9 with the corresponding amino acid residue in mouse CD9, revealed that substitution of Gly158 is critical for the reduction of the upregulation activity and secondly for the substitution of Val159 and Thr175. These three amino acid residues were deduced to be located on the head domain of the second extracellular loop, suggesting that interactions of CD9 with DTR or DT at the domain containing these three amino acids were important for the upregulation of DT binding.",,
8838570,CD9 of mouse brain is implicated in neurite outgrowth and cell migration in vitro and is associated with the alpha 6/beta 1 integrin and the neural adhesion molecule L1.,"We describe here a novel monoclonal antibody (mab H6) which recognizes CD9, an integral cell surface constituent previously described in cells of the hematopoietic lineage and involved in the aggregation of platelets. Mab H6 was raised against membranes of immature mouse astrocytes and reacted with a protein of 25-27 kD in detergent extracts of adult mouse brain membranes. Sequence analysis of the N-terminal amino acids revealed an identity of 96% with CD9 from mouse kidney. CD9 was localized in the central and peripheral mouse nervous systems: in the spinal cord of 11-day-old mouse embryos, CD9 was strongly expressed in the floor and roof plates. In the adult mouse sciatic nerve, myelin sheaths were highly CD9-immunoreactive. Mab H6 reacted with the cell surfaces of both glial cells and neurons in culture and inhibited migration of neuronal cell bodies, neurite fasciculation and outgrowth of astrocytic processes from cerebellar microexplants. Neurite outgrowth from isolated small cerebellar neurons was increased in the presence of mab H6 on substrate-coated laminin, but not on substrate-coated poly-L-lysine. Addition of mab H6 elicited an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in these cells on substrate-coated laminin. Immunoprecipitates of CD9 from cultured mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells contained the alpha 6/beta 1 integrin. Moreover, preparations of CD9 immunoaffinity-purified from adult mouse brain using a mab H6 column contained the neural adhesion molecule L1, but not other neural adhesion molecules. CD9 bound to L1, but not to NCAM or MAG. Both the alpha 6/beta 1 integrin and L1 could be induced to coredistribute with CD9 on the surface of cultured neuroblastoma N2A cells. The combined observations suggest that CD9 can associate with L1 and alpha 6/beta 1 integrin to influence neural cell interactions in vitro.",Journal of neuroscience research,1996
21054788,CD91 interacts with mannan-binding lectin (MBL) through the MBL-associated serine protease-binding site.,"CD91 plays an important role in the scavenging of apoptotic material, possibly through binding to soluble pattern-recognition molecules. In this study, we investigated the interaction of CD91 with mannan-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins and lung surfactant proteins. Both MBL and L-ficolin were found to bind CD91. The MBL-CD91 interaction was time- and concentration-dependent and could be inhibited by known ligands of CD91. MBL-associated serine protease 3 (MASP-3) also inhibited binding between MBL and CD91, suggesting that the site of interaction is located at or near the MASP-MBL interaction site. This was confirmed by using MBL mutants deficient for MASP binding that were unable to interact with CD91. These findings demonstrate that MBL and L-ficolin interact with CD91, strongly suggesting that they have the potential to function as soluble recognition molecules for scavenging microbial and apoptotic material by CD91.",,
10464311,"cDNA cloning and chromosomal localization of human alpha(11) integrin. A collagen-binding, I domain-containing, beta(1)-associated integrin alpha-chain present in muscle tissues.","We previously identified a novel integrin alpha-chain in human fetal muscle cells (Gullberg, D., Velling, T., Sjöberg, G., and Sejersen, T. (1995) Dev. Dyn. 204, 57-65). We have now isolated the full-length cDNA for this integrin subunit, alpha(11). The open reading frame of the cDNA encodes a precursor of 1188 amino acids. The predicted mature protein of 1166 amino acids contains seven conserved FG-GAP repeats, an I domain with a metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif, a short transmembrane region, and a unique cytoplasmic domain of 24 amino acids containing the sequence GFFRS. alpha(11), like other I domain integrins, lacks a dibasic cleavage site for generation of a heavy chain and a light chain, and it contains three potential divalent cation binding sites in repeats 5-7. The presence of 22 inserted amino acids in the extracellular stalk portion (amino acids 804-826) distinguishes the alpha(11) integrin sequence from other integrin alpha-chains. Amino acid sequence comparisons reveal the highest identity of 42% with the alpha(10) integrin chain. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to alpha(11) integrin captures a 145-kDa protein distinctly larger than the 140-kDa alpha(2) integrin chain when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Fluorescence in situ hybridization maps the integrin alpha(11) gene to chromosome 15q23, in the vicinity of an identified locus for Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Based on Northern blotting, integrin alpha(11) mRNA levels are high in the adult human uterus and in the heart and intermediate in skeletal muscle and some other tissues tested. During in vitro myogenic differentiation, alpha(11) mRNA and protein are up-regulated. Studies of ligand binding properties show that alpha(11)beta(1) binds collagen type I-Sepharose, and cultured muscle cells localize alpha(11)beta(1) into focal contacts on collagen type I. Future studies will reveal the importance of alpha(11)beta(1) for muscle development and integrity in adult muscle and other tissues.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
8995416,cDNA cloning and chromosomal localization of the human telencephalin and its distinctive interaction with lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1.,"We have isolated cDNA encoding human telencephalin (TLN), a brain segment-specific neuronal adhesion molecule. Human TLN comprises an NH2-terminal signal peptide, an extracellular region with nine Ig-like domains, a single transmembrane region, and a COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The NH2-terminal five Ig-like domains of TLN were closely related to those of intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs)-1 and -3. The TLN gene was mapped to the human chromosome 19p13.2, where the ICAM-1, -3, and -4 (LW) genes are located. Furthermore, we observed lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)-mediated adhesion of HL-60 cells on recombinant TLN protein, as well as on ICAM-1. However, the interaction of TLN with LFA-1 on HL-60 cells was divalent cation-independent and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation-independent. We conclude that TLN is a unique neuronal member of ICAM subgroup of the Ig superfamily and propose a novel type of interaction between the Ig superfamily molecule and integrin, which does not require the activation of integrin. TLN on the surface of telencephalic neurons may be a target molecule in the brain for LFA-1-expressing microglia and leukocytes in physiological or pathological conditions.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
2850496,cDNA cloning and expression of a human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor specific for B-chain-containing PDGF molecules.,"The structure of the human receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been deduced through cDNA cloning. A 5.45-kilobase-pair cDNA clone predicts a 1,106-amino-acid polypeptide, including the cleavable signal sequence. The overall amino acid sequence similarity with the murine PDGF receptor is 85%. After transcription of the cDNA and translation in vitro, a PDGF receptor antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate a product of predicted size, which also could be phosphorylated in vitro. Stable introduction of the cDNA into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells led to the expression of a 190-kilodalton component, which was immunoprecipitated by the PDGF receptor antiserum; this most probably represents the mature PDGF receptor. Binding assays with different 125I-labeled dimeric forms of PDGF A and B chains showed that the PDGF receptor expressed in CHO cells bound PDGF-BB and, to a lesser extent, PDGF-AB, but not PDGF-AA.",,
2544881,cDNA cloning and expression of the human A-type platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor establishes structural similarity to the B-type PDGF receptor.,"The primary structure of the human A-type receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been determined. A 6.5-kilobase (kb) transcript was identified through low-stringency hybridization with a probe derived from the B-type PDGF receptor cDNA. The sequence of a cDNA clone corresponding to the 6.5-kb transcript contains an open reading frame that predicts a 1089-amino acid growth factor receptor-like molecule, which displays 44% overall amino acid similarity with the PDGF B-type receptor. The two receptors have a similar domain organization, with five immunoglobulin-like domains extracellularly and an intracellular split protein tyrosine kinase domain. Transfection of the new cDNA into COS cells led to the expression of a protein specifically recognized by an antiserum previously shown to react with the PDGF A-type receptor. The expressed protein was shown to display high-affinity binding of all three 125I-labeled dimeric forms of PDGF A and B chains in a manner that is characteristic for the PDGF A-type receptor.",,
16282604,"CEACAM1, an adhesion molecule of human granulocytes, is fucosylated by fucosyltransferase IX and interacts with DC-SIGN of dendritic cells via Lewis x residues.","The CEA-related cell adhesion molecule 1, CEACAM1, is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of human granulocytes and lymphocytes, endothelia, and many epithelia. CEACAM1 is involved in the regulation of important biological processes, such as tumor growth, angiogenesis, and modulation of the immune response. CEACAM1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily carries several Lewis x (Lex) structures as we recently demonstrated by mass spectrometry of native CEACAM1 from human granulocytes. Since Lex residues of pathogens bind to the C-type lectin dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) expressed on human DCs, we hypothesized that Lex glycans of CEACAM1 are recognized by DC-SIGN. Here, we demonstrate that CEACAM1, the major carrier of Lex residues in human granulocytes, is specifically recognized by DC-SIGN via Lex residues mediating the internalization of CEACAM1 into immature DCs. Expression studies with CEACAM1 in combination with different fucosyltransferases (FUTs) revealed that FUTIX plays a key role in the synthesis of Lex groups of CEACAM1. As Lex groups on CEACAM1 are selectively attached and specifically interact with DC-SIGN, our findings suggest that CEACAM1 participates in immune regulation in physiological conditions and in pathological conditions, such as inflammation, autoimmune disease, and cancer.",,
22703826,Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) on mast cells promotes interaction with dorsal root ganglion neurites by heterophilic binding to nectin-3.,"Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) on mast cells promotes attachment and communication with neurons by homophilic binding. However, we found that mast cell CADM1 was responsible for both the attachment of mast cells to dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurites and their calcium responses to activated DRG neurites, despite the low expression of CADM1 in DRG. Instead, nectin-3 was expressed on DRG neurons and localized to regions of cell-cell contact. A neutralizing antibody to nectin-3 inhibited both mast cell attachment and subsequent calcium responses. This suggests that heterophilic binding between CADM1 and nectin-3 mediates functional DRG-mast cell interactions in vitro.",,
8006073,"Cell attachment to extracellular matrix substrates is inhibited upon downregulation of expression of calreticulin, an intracellular integrin alpha-subunit-binding protein.","We have demonstrated recently that calreticulin, an intracellular calcium-binding protein, can interact with the alpha-subunits of integrin receptors via the highly conserved KXGFFKR amino acid sequence present in the cytoplasmic domains of all integrin alpha-subunits (Rojiani et al. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 9859-9866). Here we demonstrate that calreticulin can be co-localized by immunofluorescence as well as co-purified with integrins, that recombinant calreticulin can also interact with integrins, and that the interaction occurs predominantly via the N-domain of calreticulin, to a much lesser extent with the C-domain, but not at all with the proline-rich P-domain. To demonstrate a physiological role for the interaction of calreticulin with integrins, calreticulin expression was downregulated by treating cells with antisense oligonucleotides designed to inhibit the initiation of translation of calreticulin. Antisense oligonucleotides, but not sense or non-sense oligonucleotides, inhibited attachment and spreading of cells cultured in the presence of fetal bovine serum, and also of cells plated on individual extracellular matrix substrates in the absence of serum. The antisense oligonucleotide inhibited cell proliferation of anchorage-dependent cells slightly, but there was no effect on cell viability. The effect on cell attachment was similar to that achieved by treating cells with an antisense oligonucleotide designed to inhibit translation of the integrin alpha 3 subunit, which resulted in the inhibition of cell attachment to alpha 3 beta 1-specific substrates. The effect of the antisense calreticulin oligonucleotide on cell attachment was demonstrated to be integrin-mediated since antisense calreticulin treatment of Jurkat cells abrogated the stimulation of collagen cell attachment achieved by attachment-stimulating signalling anti-alpha 2 (JBS2) and anti-beta 1 (21C8) antibodies. The oligonucleotides did not affect the rate of cell proliferation of these cells. These results demonstrate a fundamental role of calreticulin in cell-extracellular matrix interactions.",Journal of cell science,1994
26039541,Cell Surface CD74-MIF Interactions Drive Melanoma Survival in Response to Interferon-γ.,"Melanoma is believed to be a highly immunogenic tumor and recent developments in immunotherapies are promising. IFN-γ produced by immune cells has a crucial role in tumor immune surveillance; however, it has also been reported to be pro-tumorigenic. In the current study, we found that IFN-γ enhances the expression of CD74, which interacts with its ligand, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and thereby activates the PI3K/AKT pathway in melanoma, promoting tumor survival. IFN-γ increased phosphorylation of AKT Ser473 and upregulated total cell surface expression of CD74 in human melanoma cell lines tested. CD74 was highly expressed in melanoma tissues. Moreover, the expression of CD74 on tumor cells correlated with plasma IFN-γ levels in melanoma patient samples. In our analysis of melanoma cell lines, all produced MIF constitutively. Blockade of CD74-MIF interaction reduced AKT phosphorylation and expression of pro-tumorigenic molecules, including IL-6, IL-8, and BCL-2. Inhibition of CD74-MIF interaction significantly suppressed tumor growth in the presence of IFN-γ in our xenograft mouse model. Thus, we conclude that IFN-γ promotes melanoma cell survival by regulating CD74-MIF signaling, suggesting that targeting the CD74-MIF interaction under IFN-γ-stimulatory conditions would be an effective therapeutic approach for melanoma.",The Journal of investigative dermatology,2015
11336704,Cell surface glypicans are low-affinity endostatin receptors.,"Endostatin, a collagen XVIII fragment, is a potent anti-angiogenic protein. We sought to identify its endothelial cell surface receptor(s). Alkaline phosphatase- tagged endostatin bound endothelial cells revealing two binding affinities. Expression cloning identified glypican, a cell surface proteoglycan as the lower-affinity receptor. Biochemical and genetic studies indicated that glypicans' heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans were critical for endostatin binding. Furthermore, endostatin selected a specific octasulfated hexasaccharide from a sequence in heparin. We have also demonstrated a role for endostatin in renal tubular cell branching morphogenesis and show that glypicans serve as low-affinity receptors for endostatin in these cells, as in endothelial cells. Finally, antisense experiments suggest the critical importance of glypicans in mediating endostatin activities.",,
11830493,Cell surface proteoglycan syndecan-1 mediates hepatocyte growth factor binding and promotes Met signaling in multiple myeloma.,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play a crucial role in growth regulation by assembling signaling complexes and presenting growth factors to their cognate receptors. Within the immune system, expression of the HSPG syndecan-1 (CD138) is characteristic of terminally differentiated B cells, ie, plasma cells, and their malignant counterpart, multiple myeloma (MM). This study explored the hypothesis that syndecan-1 might promote growth factor signaling and tumor growth in MM. For this purpose, the interaction was studied between syndecan-1 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a putative paracrine and autocrine regulator of MM growth. The study demonstrates that syndecan-1 is capable of binding HGF and that this growth factor is indeed a potent stimulator of MM survival and proliferation. Importantly, the interaction of HGF with heparan sulfate moieties on syndecan-1 strongly promotes HGF-mediated signaling, resulting in enhanced activation of Met, the receptor tyrosine kinase for HGF. Moreover, HGF binding to syndecan-1 promotes activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B and RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, signaling routes that have been implicated in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation, respectively. These results identify syndecan-1 as a functional coreceptor for HGF that promotes HGF/Met signaling in MM cells, thus suggesting a novel function for syndecan-1 in MM tumorigenesis.",Blood,2002
10652271,Cell surface-localized matrix metalloproteinase-9 proteolytically activates TGF-beta and promotes tumor invasion and angiogenesis.,"We have uncovered a novel functional relationship between the hyaluronan receptor CD44, the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and the multifunctional cytokine TGF-beta in the control of tumor-associated tissue remodeling. CD44 provides a cell surface docking receptor for proteolytically active MMP-9 and we show here that localization of MMP-9 to cell surface is required for its ability to promote tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Our observations also indicate that MMP-9, as well as MMP-2, proteolytically cleaves latent TGF-beta, providing a novel and potentially important mechanism for TGF-beta activation. In addition, we show that MMP-9 localization to the surface of normal keratinocytes is CD44 dependent and can activate latent TGF-beta. These observations suggest that coordinated CD44, MMP-9, and TGF-beta function may provide a physiological mechanism of tissue remodeling that can be adopted by malignant cells to promote tumor growth and invasion.",,
10575006,Cell-specific glycoforms of sialoadhesin and CD45 are counter-receptors for the cysteine-rich domain of the mannose receptor.,"We previously reported that CR-Fc, an Fc chimeric protein containing the cysteine-rich (CR) domain of the mannose receptor, binds to marginal zone metallophilic macrophages (Mo) and B cell areas in the spleen and to subcapsular sinus Mo in lymph nodes of naive mice (CR-Fc(+) cells). Several CR-Fc ligands were found in spleen and lymph node tissue lysates using ligand blots. In this paper we report the identification of two of these ligands as sialoadhesin (Sn), an Mo-specific membrane molecule, and the leukocyte common antigen, CD45. CR-Fc bound selectively to Sn purified from spleen and lymph nodes and to two low molecular weight isoforms of CD45 in a sugar-dependent manner. CR-Fc binding and non-binding forms of Sn, probably derived from CR-Fc(+) and CR-Fc(-) cells respectively, were selected from spleen lysates. Analysis of the glycan pool associated with the CR-Fc-binding form revealed the presence of charged structures resistant to sialidase, absent in the non-binding form, that could correspond to sulfated structures. These results confirm the identification of the CR region of the mannose receptor as a lectin. We also demonstrate that the same glycoprotein expressed in different cells of the same organ can display distinct sugar epitopes that determine its binding properties.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
9718367,Cell-type specific and estrogen dependent expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4 and its ligand ephrin-B2 during mammary gland morphogenesis.,"Morphogenesis of the mammary gland occurs mainly during adult life and is dependent on a complex interplay of hormonal, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The molecular mechanisms involved in pattern formation of the mammary epithelium in adult life are poorly understood. Recently, several members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands have been shown to participate in pattern formation during embryogenesis and conceivably may fulfill similar functions during adult morphogenesis. We have investigated the expression of a member of this family, EphB4, and its cognate ligand, ephrin-B2, during normal and malignant mouse mammary morphogenesis. A spatially, temporarily and hormonally coordinated expression of both the receptor and ligand was observed. The receptor was predominantly localized in the myoepithelial cells surrounding the ducts and alveoli whereas ligand expression was limited to the luminal epithelial cells. Expression of both was induced at the onset of gland morphogenesis at puberty and was differentially regulated during the estrus cycle. Ovariectomy of pre-pubertal or adult females abolished the expression of both receptor and ligand and administration of estrogen alone was sufficient to restore their normal expression. Disruption of the balanced expression was observed during experimental mouse mammary carcinogenesis. Ligand expression was lost at the onset of tumorigenesis and receptor expression shifted from myoepithelial to epithelial cells with progressive malignancy. These results implicate both the EphB4 receptor and its ligand ephrin-B2 in the hormone dependent morphogenesis of the mammary gland. Furthermore, their deregulated expression may contribute to mammary carcinogenesis.",Journal of cell science,1998
15450949,Cell-type specific calcium signaling by corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 (CRF1) and 2a (CRF2(a)) receptors: phospholipase C-mediated responses in human embryonic kidney 293 but not SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells.,"The human corticotropin-releasing factor (hCRF) receptors CRF1 and CRF2(a) couple to the Gs protein. It has been postulated that CRF receptors may also signal through phospholipase C (PLC). To test this hypothesis, binding and signaling properties were determined for both receptor subtypes stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) and human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells. CRF receptors were highly expressed and strongly coupled to Gs in HEK293 and SK-N-MC cells. However, when the calcium mobilization pathway was investigated, marked differences were observed. In SK-N-MC cells, neither CRF receptor stimulated calcium mobilization in the fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) assay, whereas activation of orexin type 1 and 2 receptors stably expressed in SK-N-MC cells revealed robust calcium responses. In contrast, intracellular calcium was strongly mobilized by agonist stimulation of hCRF1 and hCRF2(a) receptors in HEK293 cells. In HEK293 cells, potency rank orders for calcium and cAMP responses were identical for both receptors, despite a rightward shift of the dose-response curves. Complete inhibition of calcium signaling of both hCRF1 and hCRF2(a) receptors was observed in the presence of the PLC inhibitor U-73,122 whereas ryanodine, an inhibitor of calcium release channels and the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-cAMPS were ineffective. Finally, CRF agonists produced a small but significant stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) accumulation in hCRF1-and hCRF2(a)-transfected HEK293 cells. These data clearly show that phospholipase C-mediated signaling of CRF receptors is dependent upon the cellular background and that in HEK293 cells human CRF receptors robustly respond in the FLIPR format.",Biochemical pharmacology,2004
8626456,"Cellular internalization and degradation of antithrombin III-thrombin, heparin cofactor II-thrombin, and alpha 1-antitrypsin-trypsin complexes is mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein.","The inhibition of proteinase activity by members of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) family is a critical regulatory mechanism for a variety of biological processes. Once formed, the serpin enzyme complexes (SECs) are removed from the circulation by a hepatic receptor. The present study suggests that this receptor is very likely the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a prominent liver receptor. In vitro binding studies revealed that antithrombin III (ATIII)-thrombin, heparin cofactor II (HCII)-thrombin, and alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT)-trypsin bound to purified LRP, and their binding was inhibited by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist of LRP-ligand binding activity. In contrast, native or modified forms of the inhibitors were unable to bind to LRP. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which express LRP, mediate the cellular internalization leading to degradation of these SECs, while mouse fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP showed no capacity to internalize and degrade these complexes. SECs were also degraded by HepG2 cells, and this process was inhibited by LRP antibodies, RAP, and chloroquine. The cellular-mediated uptake and degradation was specific for SECs; native or modified forms of the inhibitors were not internalized and degraded. Finally, in vivo clearance studies in rats demonstrated that RAP inhibited the clearance of ATIII-125I-thrombin complexes from the circulation. Together, these results indicate that LRP functions as a liver receptor responsible for the plasma clearance of SECs.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
9045712,Cellular internalization and degradation of thrombospondin-1 is mediated by the amino-terminal heparin binding domain (HBD). High affinity interaction of dimeric HBD with the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein.,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a large modular trimeric protein that has been proposed to play a diverse role in biological processes. Newly synthesized TSP-1 either is incorporated into the matrix or binds to the cell surface where it is rapidly internalized and degraded. TSP-1 catabolism is mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a large endocytic receptor that is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. Using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer experiments, we demonstrate that the very low density lipoprotein receptor can also bind and internalize TSP-1. An objective of the current investigation was to identify the portion of TSP-1 that binds to these endocytic receptors. The current studies found that the amino-terminal heparin binding domain (HBD, residues 1-214) of mouse TSP-1, when prepared as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST), bound to purified LRP with an apparent KD ranging from 10 to 25 nM. Recombinant HBD (rHBD) purified following proteolytic cleavage of GST-HBD, also bound to purified LRP, but with an apparent KD of 830 nM. The difference in affinity was attributed to the fact that GST-HBD exists in solution as a dimer, whereas rHBD is a monomer. Like TSP-1, 125I-labeled GST-HBD or 125I-labeled rHBD were internalized and degraded by wild type fibroblasts that express LRP, but not by fibroblasts that are genetically deficient in LRP. The catabolism of both 125I-labeled GST-HBD and rHBD in wild type fibroblast was blocked by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein, an inhibitor of LRP function. GST-HBD and rHBD both completely blocked catabolism of 125I-labeled TSP-1 in a dose-dependent manner, as did antibodies prepared against the HBD. Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence that the amino-terminal domain of TSP-1 binds to LRP and thus the recognition determinants on TSP-1 for both LRP and for cell surface proteoglycans reside within the same TSP-1 domain. Further, high affinity binding of TSP-1 to LRP likely results from the trimeric structure of TSP-1.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
9707421,Cellular uptake of saposin (SAP) precursor and lysosomal delivery by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP).,"Sphingolipid activator proteins SAP-A, -B, -C and -D (also called saposins) are generated by proteolytic processing from a 73 kDa precursor and function as obligatory activators of lysosomal enzymes involved in glycosphingolipid metabolism. Although the SAP precursor can be recognized by the mannose-6-phosphate (M-6-P) receptor and shuttled directly from the secretory pathway to the lysosome, a substantial fraction of newly synthesized precursor is secreted from the cell where it may participate in sphingolipid transport and signaling events. Re-uptake of the secreted precursor is mediated by high-affinity cell surface receptors that are apparently distinct from the M-6-P receptor. We found that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a multifunctional endocytic receptor that is expressed on most cells, can mediate cellular uptake and lysosomal delivery of SAP precursor. Additional in vivo experiments in mice revealed that the mannose receptor system on macrophages also participates in precursor internalization. We conclude that SAP precursor gains entry into cells by at least three independent receptor mechanisms including the M-6-P receptor, the mannose receptor and LRP.",The EMBO journal,1998
24921009,Ceruloplasmin-ferroportin system of iron traffic in vertebrates.,"Safe trafficking of iron across the cell membrane is a delicate process that requires specific protein carriers. While many proteins involved in iron uptake by cells are known, only one cellular iron export protein has been identified in mammals: ferroportin (SLC40A1). Ceruloplasmin is a multicopper enzyme endowed with ferroxidase activity that is found as a soluble isoform in plasma or as a membrane-associated isoform in specific cell types. According to the currently accepted view, ferrous iron transported out of the cell by ferroportin would be safely oxidized by ceruloplasmin to facilitate loading on transferrin. Therefore, the ceruloplasmin-ferroportin system represents the main pathway for cellular iron egress and it is responsible for physiological regulation of cellular iron levels. The most recent findings regarding the structural and functional features of ceruloplasmin and ferroportin and their relationship will be described in this review.",,

All three cell types of the glomerulus, podocytes, endothelial cells and mesangial cells, play important roles in diabetic nephropathy. In this report we used Meis1-GFP transgenic mice to purify mesangial cells from normal mice and from db/db mice, which suffer diabetic nephropathy.

11600206,Characterisation of a new chimeric ligand for galanin receptors: galanin(1-13)-[D-Trp(32)]-neuropeptide Y(25-36)amide.,"In this work, we studied a novel chimeric peptide, M242, galanin(1-13)-[D-Trp(32)]-neuropeptide Y(25-36)amide, and examined its properties in comparison with its parent peptide, M32, galanin(1-13)-neuropeptide Y(25-36)amide, a previously known high-affinity ligand for galanin receptors, and galanin itself. Binding assays performed in Bowes cells known to express human galanin receptor type 1 (hGalR1) and in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human galanin receptor type 2 (hGalR2) revealed that all three ligands had comparable affinities: at hGalR1<1 nM and at hGalR2<10 nM. However, in rat hippocampal membranes M242 had a 24-fold lower affinity than galanin (9.4 vs. 0.4 nM) and 134-fold lower affinity than M32 (9.4 vs. 0.07 nM). In the same tissue, we also examined the effects of these peptides on adenylate cyclase activity. M32 showed a weak antagonistic behaviour but M242 acted as a potent biphasic regulator of adenylate cyclase. In conclusion, we present and characterise a new peptide M242, which could be a useful tool in studies of galaninergic signalling.",,
10598788,Characterisation of human recombinant somatostatin receptors. 1. Radioligand binding studies.,"Human somatostatin receptor subtypes 1-5 (sst1-5) were characterised using the agonist radioligands [125I]LTT-SRIF28, [125I][Tyr10]CST14, [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I][Tyr3]octreotide in stably transfected Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells (CCL39 cells). The radioligands used labelled saturable and high-affinity populations of sites in each instance; at sst1-4 receptors maximum binding (Bmax) was roughly equivalent. By contrast, at sst5 receptors Bmax determined with [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I][Tyr3]octreotide was significantly lower (two-and eightfold) compared with [125I]LTT-SRIF28 and [125I][Tyr10]CST14. Experiments were performed with the stable GTP-analogue guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp) to establish guanine nucleotide sensitivity of agonist binding to sst1-5 receptors. The sensitivity towards GppNHp was quite variable depending on receptor and/or ligand. At sst1 and sst4 receptors, GppNHp produced little effect overall, whereas binding to sst3 and sst2 receptors was reduced by 70 and >80%, respectively. At sst5 receptors, the binding of [125I]LTT-SRIF28 and [125I][Tyr10]CST14 was only slightly affected by GppNHp, while [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I][Tyr3]octreotide binding was almost entirely inhibited. Thus, [125I][Tyr3]octreotide labelled about 26-fold less sst5 receptors than [125I]LTT-SRIF28, in the presence of 10 microM GppNHp. These discrepancies in guanine nucleotide sensitivity, were confirmed in GppNHp competition experiments. Competition studies were performed at the five receptors labelled with the different radioligands to establish their respective pharmacological profiles: the rank order of affinity was largely radioligand-independent at sst1-4 receptors, in contrast to sst5 receptors where it was radioligand-dependent. Thus, the pharmacological profile of [125I]LTT-SRIF28- and [125I][Tyr10]CST14-labelled sst5 sites correlated highly significantly, but did not correlate with the affinity profiles defined with [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I][Tyr3]octreotide binding to sst5 receptors. Depending on the agonist radioligand used and the receptor studied, it would appear that binding can be essentially to a guanine nucleotide-sensitive state (e.g. sst2 or sst3), a guanine nucleotide-insensitive state (sst1 or sst4) or a mixture of both (sst5); in the latter case, each radioligand defining a more or less different rank order of affinity at the same receptor. In summary, the differences in agonist receptor binding and guanine nucleotide sensitivity cannot be explained by the ternary complex model or its variations, but rather suggest the existence of multiple agonist-specific receptor states which vary from one receptor to another.",Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,1999
9346309,"Characterisation of macrophage inflammatory protein-5/human CC cytokine-2, a member of the macrophage-inflammatory-protein family of chemokines.","A human monocyte-activating CC chemokine has been identified based on sequences in an expressed sequence tag (EST) cDNA database. The protein shows highest sequence identity to the macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) group of chemokines, particularly MIP-3 (76.7%) and MIP-1alpha (75.4%), and has been named MIP-5. Model building confirms that the protein has a similar three dimensional structure to other chemokines, but has an additional third disulphide bond. Northern blot analysis and reverse-transcriptase PCR show that the mRNA for MIP-5 is expressed at a high levels in liver, intestine and in lung leukocytes. MIP-5 induces chemotaxis of human monocytes, T-lymphocytes and, to a lesser degree, eosinophils at nanomolar concentrations; it has no effect on neutrophil migration. In receptor-binding assays, MIP-5 shows IC50 values of 12 nM for competition with 125I-MIP-1alpha for binding to CC-chemokine receptor (CCR)1, and 2.5 nM for competition with 125I-MCP-3 for binding to CCR3. It shows no ability to compete with ligand for binding to the two interleukin (IL)-8 receptors (CXC-chemokine receptors 1 and 2) or to CCR2, CCR4 or CCR5. Consistent with this binding data, MIP-5 was only able to induce calcium fluxes in CHO cells stably transfected with CCR1 or CCR3.",European journal of biochemistry,1997
7774675,Characterisation of melanocortin receptor subtypes by radioligand binding analysis.,"The DNAs encoding three melanocortin receptor subtypes (melanocortin MC1 receptor, melanocortin MC3 receptor and melanocortin MC5 receptor) were expressed individually in COS (CV-1 Origin, SV40) cells to characterise their ligand binding properties. The results indicated that [125I][Nle4, D-Phe7]alpha-MSH (melanocyte stimulating hormone) bound to a single saturable site with Kd values of 85.1 +/- 8.0 pmol/l (mean +/- S.E.M), 396 +/- 65 pmol/l and 5.05 +/- 1.00 nmol/l for melanocortin MC1 receptor, melanocortin MC3 receptor and melanocortin MC3 receptor, respectively. The melanocortin MC1 receptor and the melanocortin MC5 receptor showed a similar potency order to the melanocortic peptides examined which was markedly different from the potency order of the melanocortin MC3 receptor. The melanocortin MC1 receptor and melanocortin MC5 receptor had a relatively higher affinity for alpha-MSH than gamma-MSH and beta-MSH, whereas the melanocortin MC3 receptor had higher affinity for desacetyl-alpha-MSH, gamma-MSH and beta-MSH compared to alpha-MSH. The inclusion of the endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon to prevent the breakdown of ACTH-(1-39) (adrenocorticotrophic hormone) to alpha-MSH, decreased ACTH-(1-39) binding affinity showing that ACTH-(1-39) had a much lower affinity for melanocortin MC1 receptor than reported earlier.",European journal of pharmacology,1995
14691055,"Characterisation of the binding of [3H]-SB-674042, a novel nonpeptide antagonist, to the human orexin-1 receptor.","1. This study characterises the binding of a novel nonpeptide antagonist radioligand, [(3)H]SB-674042 (1-(5-(2-fluoro-phenyl)-2-methyl-thiazol-4-yl)-1-((S)-2-(5-phenyl-(1,3,4)oxadiazol-2-ylmethyl)-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-methanone), to the human orexin-1 (OX(1)) receptor stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in both a whole cell assay and in a cell membrane-based scintillation proximity assay (SPA) format. 2. Specific binding of [(3)H]SB-674042 was saturable in both whole cell and membrane formats. Analyses suggested a single high-affinity site, with K(d) values of 3.76+/-0.45 and 5.03+/-0.31 nm, and corresponding B(max) values of 30.8+/-1.8 and 34.4+/-2.0 pmol mg protein(-1), in whole cell and membrane formats, respectively. Kinetic studies yielded similar K(d) values. 3. Competition studies in whole cells revealed that the native orexin peptides display a low affinity for the OX(1) receptor, with orexin-A displaying a approximately five-fold higher affinity than orexin-B (K(i) values of 318+/-158 and 1516+/-597 nm, respectively). 4. SB-334867, SB-408124 (1-(6,8-difluoro-2-methyl-quinolin-4-yl)-3-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)-urea) and SB-410220 (1-(5,8-difluoro-quinolin-4-yl)-3-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)-urea) all displayed high affinity for the OX(1) receptor in both whole cell (K(i) values 99+/-18, 57+/-8.3 and 19+/-4.5 nm, respectively) and membrane (K(i) values 38+/-3.6, 27+/-4.1 and 4.5+/-0.2 nm, respectively) formats. 5. Calcium mobilisation studies showed that SB-334867, SB-408124 and SB-410220 are all functional antagonists of the OX(1) receptor, with potencies in line with their affinities, as measured in the radioligand binding assays, and with approximately 50-fold selectivity over the orexin-2 receptor. 6.

The availability of this radioligand will be a valuable tool with which to investigate the physiological functions of OX(1) receptors.",,
8884876,Characterisation of the melanocortin 4 receptor by radioligand binding.,"The DNA encoding the human melanocortin 4 receptor was expressed in COS (CV-1 origin, SV 40) cells and its radioligand binding properties was tested by using the [125I][Nle4, D-Phe7] alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). The radioligand was found to bind to a single saturable site with a Kd of 3.84 +/- 0.57 nmol/l in the MC4 receptor expressing cells. The order of potency of a number of substance competing for the [125I][Nle4, D-Phe7] alpha-MSH binding was the following; [Nle4, D-Phe7] alpha-MSH > [Nle4]-alpha-MSH > beta-MSH > desacetyl-alpha-MSH > alpha-MSH > ACTH (1-39) > ACTH (4-10) > gamma 1-MSH > gamma 2-MSH. This order of potency is unique for the melanocortin 4 receptor when compared to our previously published data for the other melanocortin receptor subtypes. Most notably the melanocortin 4 receptor shows highest affinity for beta-MSH, among the endogenous MSH-peptides. Furthermore the melanocortin 4 receptor shows very low affinity for the gamma-MSH peptides. This distinguishes the melanocortin 4 receptor from the melanocortin 3 receptor, which is the other major central nervous system melanocortin-receptor, as melanocortin 3 receptor shows high affinity for gamma-MSH. Our finding might indicate a specific role for beta-MSH for the melanocortin 4 receptor.",,
8460684,Characterization and ontogeny of endothelin receptors in human placenta.,"Because of the potent mitogenic and vasoactive properties of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and the presence of its receptor in third trimester placenta, we postulated that ET-1 might be involved in human placental growth and vascularization during development. As an initial approach to test this hypothesis, placental ET receptors were characterized and quantified in each trimester of pregnancy. Membrane-rich particulates were prepared from first-, second-, and third-trimester villous human placenta obtained immediately after pregnancy termination or delivery. ET receptors were characterized by radioligand saturation analysis, ligand competition, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine the concentration, affinity, and specificity of ET binding sites, and to document the presence of specific ET-receptor subtype mRNA transcripts in placentas from each trimester. Kinetic determinations of 125I-labeled ET-1 binding yielded a Kd = 61 pM, consistent with the equilibrium determinations of 34 +/- 6 pM (n = 11). The concentration of ET receptors decreased significantly from 682 +/- 94 fmol/mg protein (n = 4) in the first trimester to 266 +/- 89 fmol/mg protein (n = 4) in the third trimester. Competition studies with unlabeled ET-1 indicated a single class of binding sites with a Ki = 49 +/- 5 pM (n = 9), whereas competition with ET-3 demonstrated binding sites with two affinities.

21303848,Characterization of a Dchs1 mutant mouse reveals requirements for Dchs1-Fat4 signaling during mammalian development.,"The Drosophila Dachsous and Fat proteins function as ligand and receptor, respectively, for an intercellular signaling pathway that regulates Hippo signaling and planar cell polarity. Although gene-targeted mutations in two mammalian Fat genes have been described, whether mammals have a Fat signaling pathway equivalent to that in Drosophila, and what its biological functions might be, have remained unclear. Here, we describe a gene-targeted mutation in a murine Dachsous homolog, Dchs1. Analysis of the phenotypes of Dchs1 mutant mice and comparisons with Fat4 mutant mice identify requirements for these genes in multiple organs, including the ear, kidney, skeleton, intestine, heart and lung. Dchs1 and Fat4 single mutants and Dchs1 Fat4 double mutants have similar phenotypes throughout the body. In some cases, these phenotypes suggest that Dchs1-Fat4 signaling influences planar cell polarity. In addition to the appearance of cysts in newborn kidneys, we also identify and characterize a requirement for Dchs1 and Fat4 in growth, branching and cell survival during early kidney development. Dchs1 and Fat4 are predominantly expressed in mesenchymal cells in multiple organs, and mutation of either gene increases protein staining for the other. Our analysis implies that Dchs1 and Fat4 function as a ligand-receptor pair during murine development, and identifies novel requirements for Dchs1-Fat4 signaling in multiple organs.",,
12719537,Characterization of a family of endogenous neuropeptide ligands for the G protein-coupled receptors GPR7 and GPR8.,"GPR7 and GPR8 are orphan G protein-coupled receptors that are highly similar to each other. These receptors are expressed predominantly in brain, suggesting roles in central nervous system function. We have purified an endogenous peptide ligand for GPR7 from bovine hypothalamus extracts. This peptide, termed neuropeptide B (NPB), has a C-6-brominated tryptophan residue at the N terminus. It binds and activates human GPR7 or GPR8 with median effective concentrations (EC(50)) of 0.23 nM and 15.8 nM, respectively. In situ hybridization shows distinct localizations of the prepro-NPB mRNA in mouse brain, i.e., in paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, hippocampus, and several nuclei in midbrain and brainstem. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of NPB in mice induces hyperphagia during the first 2 h, followed by hypophagia. Intracerebroventricular injection of NPB produces analgesia to s.c. formalin injection in rats. Through EST database searches, we identified a putative paralogous peptide. This peptide, termed neuropeptide W (NPW), also has an N-terminal tryptophan residue. Synthetic human NPW binds and activates human GPR7 or GPR8 with EC(50) values of 0.56 nM and 0.51 nM, respectively. The expression of NPW mRNA in mouse brain is confined to specific nuclei in midbrain and brainstem. These findings suggest diverse physiological functions of NPB and NPW in the central nervous system, acting as endogenous ligands on GPR7 andor GPR8.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2003
10780976,"Characterization of a novel nonpeptide vasopressin V(2)-agonist, OPC-51803, in cells transfected human vasopressin receptor subtypes.","We discovered the first nonpeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) V(2)-receptor agonist, OPC-51803. Pharmacological properties of OPC-51803 were elucidated using HeLa cells expressing human AVP receptor subtypes (V(2), V(1a) and V(1b)) and compared with those of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP), a peptide V(2)-receptor agonist. OPC-51803 and dDAVP displaced [(3)H]-AVP binding to human V(2)- and V(1a)-receptors with K(i) values of 91.9+/-10.8 nM (n = 6) and 3.12+/-0.38 nM (n = 6) for V(2)-receptors, and 819+/-39 nM (n = 6) and 41.5+/-9.9 nM (n = 6) for V(1a)-receptors, indicating that OPC-51803 was about nine times more selective for V(2)-receptors, similar to the selectivity of dDAVP. OPC-51803 scarcely displaced [(3)H]-AVP binding to human V(1b)-receptors even at 10(-4) M, while dDAVP showed potent affinity to human V(1b)-receptors with the K(i) value of 13.7+/-3.2 nM (n = 4). OPC-51803 concentration-dependently increased cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production in HeLa cells expressing human V(2)-receptors with an EC(50) value of 189+/-14 nM (n = 6). The concentration-response curve for cyclic AMP production induced by OPC-51803 was shifted to the right in the presence of a V(2)-antagonist, OPC-31260. At 10(-5) M, OPC-51803 did not increase the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in HeLa cells expressing human V(1a)-receptors. On the other hand, dDAVP increased [Ca(2+)](i) in HeLa cells expressing human V(1a)- and V(1b)-receptors in a concentration-dependent fashion. From these results, OPC-51803 has been confirmed to be the first nonpeptide agonist for human AVP V(2)-receptors without agonistic activities for V(1a)- and V(1b)-receptors. OPC-51803 may be useful for the treatment of AVP-deficient pathophysiological states and as a tool for AVP researches.",,
9525886,Characterization of a novel subtype of human G protein-coupled receptor for lysophosphatidic acid.,"The recent identification of the Vzg-1/Edg2 protein as a functional G protein-coupled receptor for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has allowed a sequence-based search for new genes that may encode novel subtypes of LPA receptors. A human cDNA encoding a G protein-coupled receptor, designated Edg4, was identified by searching the GenBankTM for homologs of the human Edg2 LPA receptor. The Edg4 protein is 46% identical and 72% similar in amino acid sequence to human Edg2. When overexpressed in Jurkat T cells, the Edg4 protein mediated LPA-induced activation of a serum response element reporter gene with LPA concentration dependence (EC50 of 10 nM) and specificity. This LPA-induced reporter gene activation could be partially inhibited by pretreatment with pertussis toxin or C3 exoenzyme, suggesting requirements for both a Gi protein and Rho GTPase. Overexpression of Edg4 in Jurkat cells also led to increases in specific binding sites for [3H]LPA. Northern blots revealed that two edg4 mRNA transcripts of 1.8 and 8 kilobases are distributed very differently from edg2 mRNAs in adult human tissues and several cancer cell lines. The existence and distinctive tissue expression of structurally different subtypes of LPA receptors may provide one basis for tissue-specific functions and permit independent regulation of each subtype of LPA receptor.",,
11278629,Characterization of a powerful high affinity antagonist that inhibits biological activities of human interleukin-13.,"Interleukin-13 (IL-13), a predominantly Th2-derived cytokine, appears to play a central pathological role in asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, some parasitic infections, and cancer. We hypothesized that an IL-13 antagonist may have profound therapeutic utility in these conditions. We, therefore, mutagenized human IL-13 in which Glu at position 13 was substituted by a Lys residue. This highly purified recombinant IL-13 variant, IL-13E13K, bound with 4-fold higher affinity to the IL-13 receptor than wild-type IL-13 but retained no detectable proliferative activity on the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line. IL-13E13K competitively inhibited IL-13- and IL-4-dependent TF-1 proliferation. It also inhibited IL-13-induced STAT-6 (signal transduction and activator of transducer-6) activation in immune cells and cancer cells and reversed IL-13-induced inhibition of CD14 expression on human primary monocytes. These results demonstrate that high affinity binding and signal generation can be uncoupled efficiently in a ligand receptor interaction. These results also suggest that IL-13E13K may be a useful antagonist for the treatment of allergic, inflammatory, and parasitic diseases or even malignancies in which IL-13 plays a central role.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
9892020,Characterization of Agouti-related protein binding to melanocortin receptors.,"Agouti-related protein (AGRP) is a naturally occurring antagonist of melanocortin action that is thought to play an important role in the hypothalamic control of feeding behavior. The exact mechanism of AGRP and Agouti protein action has been difficult to examine, in part because of difficulties in producing homogeneous forms of these molecules that can be used for direct binding assays. In this report we describe the application of chemical protein synthesis to the construction of two novel AGRP variants. Examination of the biological activity of the AGRP variants demonstrates that a truncated variant, human AGRP(87-132), a 46-amino acid variant based on the carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich domain of AGRP, is equipotent to an 111-amino acid variant, mouse [Leu127Pro]AGRP (mature AGRP minus its signal sequence), in its ability to dose dependently inhibit alpha-MSH-generated cAMP generation at the cloned melanocortin receptors. Furthermore, deletion of the amino-terminal portion of the full-length variant did not alter the MCR subtype specificity of AGRP(87-132). Finally, iodination of human AGRP(87-132) provided a useful reagent with which the binding properties of AGRP could be analyzed. In both conventional and photoemulsion binding studies [125I]AGRP(87-132) was observed only to bind to cells expressing melanocortin receptors MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R. These results demonstrate that the residues critical for receptor binding, alpha-MSH inhibition, and melanocortin receptor subtype specificity are all located in the carboxyl terminus of the molecule. Because [Nle4, D-Phe7] (NDP)-MSH displaces the binding of [125I]AGRP(87-132) to MCRs and AGRP(87-132) displaces the binding of [125I]NDP-MSH, we conclude that these molecules bind in a competitive fashion to melanocortin receptors.",,
26611206,"Characterization of apela, a novel endogenous ligand of apelin receptor, in the adult heart.","The G protein-coupled apelin receptor regulates important processes of the cardiovascular homeostasis, including cardiac development, cardiac contractility, and vascular tone. Most recently, a novel endogenous peptide ligand for the apelin receptor was identified in zebrafish, and it was named apela/elabela/toddler. The peptide was originally considered as an exclusively embryonic regulator, and so far its function in the adult organism remains elusive. We show here that apela is predominantly expressed in the non-cardiomyocyte fraction in the adult rodent heart. We also provide evidence that apela binds to apelin receptors in the heart. Using isolated adult rat hearts, we demonstrate, that just like the fellow receptor agonist apelin, apela increases cardiac contractility and induces coronary vasodilation already in the nanomolar level. The inotropic effect, as revealed by Western blot analysis, is accompanied by a significant increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 activation markedly attenuates the apela-induced inotropy. Analysis of samples from infarcted mouse hearts showed that expression of both apela and apelin receptor is induced in failing mouse hearts and correlate with left ventricular ejection fraction. Hence, we conclude that apela is present in the adult heart, is upregulated in post-infarction cardiac remodeling, and increases cardiac contractility in an ERK1/2-dependent manner.",Basic research in cardiology,2016
10617103,"Characterization of apelin, the ligand for the APJ receptor.","The apelin peptide was recently discovered and demonstrated to be the endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor, APJ. A search of the GenBank databases retrieved a rat expressed sequence tag partially encoding the preproapelin sequence. The GenBank search also revealed a human sequence on chromosome Xq25-26.1, containing the gene encoding preproapelin. We have used the rat sequence to screen a rat brain cDNA library to obtain a cDNA encoding the full-length open reading frame of rat preproapelin. This cDNA encoded a protein of 77 amino acids, sharing an identity of 82% with human preproapelin. Northern and in situ hybridization analyses revealed both human and rat apelin and APJ to be expressed in the brain and periphery. Both sequence and mRNA expression distribution analyses revealed similarities between apelin and angiotensin II, suggesting they that share related physiological roles. A synthetic apelin peptide was injected intravenously into male Wistar rats, resulting in immediate lowering of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which persisted for several minutes. Intraperitoneal apelin injections induced an increase in drinking behavior within the first 30 min after injection, with a return to baseline within 1 h.",Journal of neurochemistry,2000
2446864,Characterization of binding properties of the myelin-associated glycoprotein to extracellular matrix constituents.,"The myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) can be obtained from adult mouse brain from detergent-lysates of a crude membrane fraction as a 96-100 kd form (detergent solubilized MAG), and from 100,000 g supernatants of homogenates as a 90-96 kd form (soluble MAG). The soluble form distributes into the Triton X-114-poor aqueous phase, while detergent-solubilized MAG predominantly enters the Triton X-114-rich phase. Both molecular forms bind to heparin in hypo- and isotonic buffers. Soluble MAG binds to several collagens (type G, I, II, III, IV, V, VI, IX) with a kd of 5.7 X 10(-8) M for collagen type IX and 2.0 X 10(-7) for collagen type IV. Binding of 125I-labeled MAG to collagen G can be completely inhibited by unlabeled MAG and collagen G, but not by heat-denatured collagen. MAG does not bind to itself, laminin, fibronectin, or the neural cell adhesion molecules L1 and N-CAM. Binding of MAG to collagen G is most effectively blocked by a high molecular weight dextran sulfate, heparan sulfate and heparin, with chondroitin sulfate and a low molecular weight dextran sulfate being less potent blockers. These findings are in agreement with previous observations on the localization of MAG in basal lamina and interstitial collagens of the sciatic nerve in situ.",The EMBO journal,1987
7901875,"Characterization of binding sites in rat for A, B and C-type natriuretic peptides.","Binding studies, affinity cross-linking and guanylate cyclase assays allowed a comparison of receptors with which the rat forms of atrial/A-type natriuretic peptide (rANP), brain/B-type natriuretic peptide (rBNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (rCNP) interact in rat kidney cortex and lung. This work represents the first study in which the rat form of BNP (= rBNP-45/iso-rANP(1-45)) has been used as a radiolabelled tracer to further characterize its receptors in these tissues. In addition, these studies stress the use of the same species of natriuretic peptide and assay system, an important experimental des ign given that BNPs show species-specific differences in structure. rBNP-45 bound with lower affinity to rANP (99-126) receptors, namely guanylate cyclase-linked receptor(s) and C-receptor. No receptor which interacted with only rBNP-45 was detectable in lung and kidney cortex. Since rBNP-45 interacted preferentially with the C-receptor and was less potent than rANP(99-126) in stimulating glomerular guanylate cyclase, rBNP-45 may signal through another second messenger in addition to cyclic GMP. Work with truncated analogues of this hormone pinpointed regions of this peptide which may contribute to receptor binding affinity and guanylate cyclase activation. CNP-22 bound to only a subset of ANP receptors and was least effective in stimulating glomerular guanylate cyclase, suggesting a differential mode of action from ANP.",Regulatory peptides,1993
10504300,Characterization of bone morphogenetic protein-6 signaling pathways in osteoblast differentiation.,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-6 is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-(&bgr;) superfamily, and is most similar to BMP-5, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and OP-2/BMP-8. In the present study, we characterized the endogenous BMP-6 signaling pathway during osteoblast differentiation. BMP-6 strongly induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in cells of osteoblast lineage, including C2C12 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells, and ROB-C26 cells. The profile of binding of BMP-6 to type I and type II receptors was similar to that of OP-1/BMP-7 in C2C12 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells; BMP-6 strongly bound to activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-2 (also termed ActR-I), together with type II receptors, i.e. BMP type II receptor (BMPR-II) and activin type II receptor (ActR-II). In addition, BMP-6 weakly bound to BMPR-IA (ALK-3), to which BMP-2 also bound. In contrast, binding of BMP-6 to BMPR-IB (ALK-6), and less efficiently to ALK-2 and BMPR-IA, together with BMPR-II was detected in ROB-C26 cells. Intracellular signalling was further studied using C2C12 and MC3T3-E1 cells. Among the receptor-regulated Smads activated by BMP receptors, BMP-6 strongly induced phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Smad5, and less efficiently those of Smad1. However, Smad8 was constitutively phosphorylated, and no further phosphorylation or nuclear accumulation of Smad8 by BMP-6 was observed. These findings indicate that in the process of differentiation to osteoblasts, BMP-6 binds to ALK-2 as well as other type I receptors, and transduces signals mainly through Smad5 and possibly through Smad1.",Journal of cell science,1999
9558365,"Characterization of CKbeta8 and CKbeta8-1: two alternatively spliced forms of human beta-chemokine, chemoattractants for neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, and potent agonists at CC chemokine receptor 1.","Two new members of human beta-chemokine cDNA were isolated based on structural and functional similarities to human leukotactin-1. One of these clones was identical to the previously isolated human beta-chemokine, CKbeta8, whereas the other is a splicing variant of CKbeta8, therefore named CKbeta8-1. CKbeta8 was short in 51 nucleotides (17 amino acids) compared with CKbeta8-1. The mature proteins of CKbeta8-1 and CKbeta8 consisted of 116 and 99 amino acids with calculated molecular weights of 12,500 and 10,950, respectively. Both CKbeta8-1 and CKbeta8 were potent agonists at CCR1. These chemokines chemoattracted neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. They also significantly suppressed colony formation by human bone marrow, granulocyte-macrophage, erythroid, and multipotential progenitor cells stimulated by combinations of growth factors. To our knowledge, this is the first example that an alternative splicing produces two active beta-chemokines from a single gene.",,
15795245,Characterization of DC-SIGN/R interaction with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp120 and ICAM molecules favors the receptor's role as an antigen-capturing rather than an adhesion receptor.,"The dendritic cell (DC)-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3)-grabbing nonintegrin binding receptor (DC-SIGN) was shown to bind human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral envelope protein gp120 and proposed to function as a Trojan horse to enhance trans-virus infection to host T cells. To better understand the mechanism by which DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR selectively bind HIV-1 gp120, we constructed a series of deletion mutations in the repeat regions of both receptors. Different truncated receptors exist in different oligomeric forms. The carbohydrate binding domain without any repeats was monomeric, whereas the full extracellular receptors existed as tetramers. All reconstituted receptors retained their ability to bind gp120. The dissociation constant, however, differed drastically from micromolar values for the monomeric receptors to nanomolar values for the tetrameric receptors, suggesting that the repeat region of these receptors contributes to the avidity of gp120 binding. Such oligomerization may provide a mechanism for the receptor to selectively recognize pathogens containing multiple high-mannose-concentration carbohydrates. In contrast, the receptors bound to ICAMs with submicromolar affinities that are similar to those of two nonspecific cell surface glycoproteins, FcgammaRIIb and FcgammaRIII, and the oligomerization of DC-SIGNR resulted in no increase in binding affinity to ICAM-3. These findings suggest that DC-SIGN may not discriminate other cell surface glycoproteins from ICAM-3 binding. The pH dependence in DC-SIGN binding to gp120 showed that the receptor retained high-affinity gp120 binding at neutral pH but lost gp120 binding at pH 5, suggesting a release mechanism of HIV in the acidic endosomal compartment by DC-SIGN. Our work contradicts the function of DC-SIGN as a Trojan horse to facilitate HIV-1 infection; rather, it supports the function of DC-SIGN/R (a designation referring to both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR) as an antigen-capturing receptor.",,
10515610,Characterization of ephrin-A1 and ephrin-A4 as ligands for the EphA8 receptor protein tyrosine kinase.,"The Eph receptors are the largest known family of receptor protein tyrosine kinases, which play important roles with their ligands called ephrin in the neural development, angiogenesis, and vascular network assembly. It was previously shown that ephrin-A2, -A3 and -A5 bind to, and activate the EphA8 receptor tyrosine kinase, respectively. In this study, we have examined if there are other additional ephrin ligands interacting with the EphA8 receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. For this purpose, we have constructed chimeric ephrin-A1, -A4, -B1, -B2 or -B3 ligands consisting of the Fc portion of human IgG fused to their carboxyl-terminus. Both ephrin-A1 and ephrin-A4 chimeric ligands efficiently bound to the EphA8 receptor expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, whereas the transmembrane ligands including ephrin-B1, -B2 and -B3 did not. Additionally we have demonstrated that both the EphA8-TrkB chimeric receptor and the EphA8 receptor expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts are efficiently tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulating with epthin-A1 or -A4 but none of transmembrane ephrin-B proteins. These results strongly indicate that the EphA8 receptor functions exclusively as an glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked ephrin ligand-dependent receptor protein tyrosine kinase.",Molecules and cells,1999
9228058,"Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, CD95)-Fas ligand interaction.","The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
8621659,"Characterization of Gas6, a member of the superfamily of G domain-containing proteins, as a ligand for Rse and Axl.","Rse, Ax1, and c-Mer comprise a family of cell adhesion molecule-related tyrosine kinase receptors. Human Gas6 was recently shown to act as a ligand for both human Rse (Godowski et al., 1995) and human Ax1 (Varnum et al., 1995). Gas6 contains an NH2-terminal Gla domain followed by four epidermal growth factor-like repeats and tandem globular (G) domains. The G domains are related to those found in sex hormone-binding globulin and to those utilized by laminin and agrin for binding to the dystroglycan complex. A series of Gas6 variants were tested for their ability to bind to Rse and Ax1. The Gla domain and epidermal growth factor-like repeats were not required for receptor binding, as deletion variants of Gas6 which lacked these domains bound to the extracellular domains of both Rse and Axl. A deletion variant of Gas6 containing just the G domain region was shown to activate Rse phosphorylation. These results provide evidence that G domains can act as signaling molecules by activating transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, they provide a structural link between the activation of cell adhesion related receptors and the control of cell growth and differentiation by the G domain-containing superfamily of proteins.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
15528268,Characterization of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor beta-arrestin 2 interaction: a high-affinity receptor phenotype.,"To dissect the interaction between beta-arrestin ((beta)arr) and family B G protein-coupled receptors, we constructed fusion proteins between the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor and (beta)arr2. The fusion constructs had an increase in apparent affinity selectively for glucagon, suggesting that (beta)arr2 interaction locks the receptor in a high-affinity conformation, which can be explored by some, but not all, ligands. The fusion constructs adopted a signaling phenotype governed by the tethered (beta)arr2 with an attenuated G protein-mediated cAMP signal and a higher maximal internalization compared with wild-type receptors. This distinct phenotype of the fusion proteins can not be mimicked by coexpressing wild-type receptor with (beta)arr2. However, when the wild-type receptor was coexpressed with both (beta)arr2 and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5, a phenotype similar to that observed for the fusion constructs was observed. We conclude that the glucagon-like peptide 1 fusion construct mimics the natural interaction of the receptor with (beta)arr2 with respect to binding peptide ligands, G protein-mediated signaling and internalization, and that this distinct molecular phenotype is reminiscent of that which has previously been characterized for family A G protein-coupled receptors, suggesting similarities in the effect of (beta)arr interaction between family A and B receptors also at the molecular level.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",2005
11116211,Characterization of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor-binding determinants.,"Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a potent insulinotropic hormone currently under study as a therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes. Since an understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to high-affinity receptor (R) binding and activation may facilitate the development of more potent GLP-1R agonists, we have localized specific regions of GLP-1R required for binding. The purified N-terminal fragment (hereafter referred to as NT) of the GLP-1R produced in either insect (Sf9) or mammalian (COS-7) cells was shown to bind GLP-1. The physical interaction of NT with GLP-1 was first demonstrated by cross-linking ((125)I-GLP-1/NT complex band at approximately 28 kDa) and secondly by attachment to Ni(2+)-NTA beads. The GLP-1R NT protein attached to beads bound GLP-1, but with lower affinity (inhibitory concentration (IC(50)): 4.5 x 10(-7) M) than wild-type (WT) GLP-1R (IC(50): 5.2 x 10(-9)M). The low affinity of GLP-1R NT suggested that other receptor domains may contribute to GLP-1 binding. This was supported by studies using chimeric glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptors. GIP(1-151)/GLP-1R, but not GIP(1-222)/GLP-1R, exhibited specific GLP-1 binding and GLP-1-induced cAMP production, suggesting that the region encompassing transmembrane (TM) domain 1 through to TM3 was required for binding. Since it was hypothesized that certain charged or polar amino acids in this region might be involved in binding, these residues (TM2-TM3) were analyzed by substitution mutagenesis. Five mutants (K197A, D198A, K202A, D215A, R227A) displayed remarkably reduced binding affinity. These studies indicate that the NT domain of the GLP-1R is able to bind GLP-1, but charged residues concentrated at the distal TM2/extracellular loop-1 (EC1) interface (K197, D198, K202) and in EC1 (D215 and R227) probably contribute to the binding determinants of the GLP-1R.",,

16785534,Characterization of human complement receptor type 2 (CR2/CD21) as a receptor for IFN-alpha: a potential role in systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Human complement receptor type 2 (CR2/CD21) is a B lymphocyte membrane glycoprotein that plays a central role in the immune responses to foreign Ags as well as the development of autoimmunity to nuclear Ags in systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition to these three well-characterized ligands, C3d/iC3b, EBV-gp350, and CD23, a previous study has identified CR2 as a potential receptor for IFN-alpha. IFN-alpha, a multifunctional cytokine important in the innate immune system, has recently been proposed to play a major pathogenic role in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus in humans and mice. In this study, we have shown using surface plasmon resonance and ELISA approaches that CR2 will bind IFN-alpha in the same affinity range as the other three well-characterized ligands studied in parallel. In addition, we show that IFN-alpha interacts with short consensus repeat domains 1 and 2 in a region that serves as the ligand binding site for C3d/iC3b, EBV-gp350, and CD23. Finally, we show that treatment of purified human peripheral blood B cells with the inhibitory anti-CR2 mAb 171 diminishes the induction of IFN-alpha-responsive genes. Thus, IFN-alpha represents a fourth class of extracellular ligands for CR2 and interacts with the same domain as the other three ligands. Defining the role of CR2 as compared with the well-characterized type 1 IFN-alpha receptor 1 and 2 in mediating innate immune and autoimmune roles of this cytokine should provide additional insights into the biologic roles of this interaction.",,

Since both the beta and the gamma subunits of the IL-2R are required for signaling by either IL-2 or IL-15, it is not surprising that these cytokines share many activities in vitro. However, the differential expression of these cytokines and the alpha chains of their receptors within various tissues and cell types suggests that IL-2 and IL-15 may perform at least partially distinct physiological functions. The production of IL-15 by macrophages, and possibly other cell types, in response to environmental stimuli and infectious agents suggests that IL-15 may play a role in protective immune responses, allograft rejection, and the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.",,
10493100,Characterization of melanocortin receptor ligands on cloned brain melanocortin receptors and on grooming behavior in the rat.,"Since the melanocortin MC3 and melanocortin MC4 receptors are the main melanocortin receptor subtypes expressed in rat brain, we characterized the activity and affinity of nine melanocortin receptor ligands using these receptors in vitro, as well as their activity in a well-defined melanocortin-induced behavior in the rat: grooming behavior. We report here that [D-Tyr4]melanotan-II and RMI-2001 (Ac-cyclo-[Cys4, Gly5, D-Phe7, Cys10]alpha-MSH-NH2) have significantly higher affinity and potency on the rat melanocortin MC4 receptor as compared to the rat melanocortin MC3 receptor. Nle-gamma-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) was the only ligand with higher affinity and potency on the rat melanocortin MC3 receptor. The potency order of melanocortin MC4 receptor agonists, but not that of melanocortin MC3 receptor agonists, fitted with the potency of these ligands to stimulate grooming behavior, when administered intracerebroventricularly. SHU9119 (Ac-cyclo-[Nle4, Asp5, D-Nal(2)7, Lys10]alpha-MSH-(4-10)-NH2) and RMI-2005 (Ac-cyclo-[Cys4, Gly5, D-Na](2)7, Nal(2)9, Cys10]alpha-MSH-(4-10)-NH2) were able to inhibit alpha-MSH-induced melanocortin receptor activity in vitro, as well as alpha-MSH-induced grooming behavior. Melanotan-II, [Nle4-D-Phe7]alpha-MSH and RMI-2001 were also effective in inducing grooming behavior when administered intravenously. In the absence of purely selective melanocortin MC(3/4) receptor ligands, we demonstrated that careful comparison of ligand potencies in vitro with ligand potencies in vivo, could identify which melanocortin receptor subtype mediated alpha-MSH-induced grooming behavior. Furthermore, blockade of novelty-induced grooming behavior by SHU9119 demonstrated that this physiological stress response is mediated via activation of the melanocortin system.",,
15023143,Characterization of pig intercellular adhesion molecule-2 and its interaction with human LFA-1.,"Understanding molecular interactions between human leukocytes and porcine endothelium is important for the future success of pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Here we describe the analysis of pig intercellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM-2). A 1020-basepair ICAM-2 cDNA generated from pig lung RNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 277-amino-acid protein with six potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The mature protein sequence was 55% identical to human ICAM-2, with conservation of five out of six residues critical for binding of the human protein to its ligand LFA-1. Northern blot analysis identified ICAM-2 transcripts of 4.0 and 1.4 kb in cultured pig endothelial cells and mRNA was detected in pig lung, spleen, kidney, liver and heart by RT-PCR. The gene structure and endothelial expression of pig ICAM-2 were strikingly similar to those of its human and mouse counterparts. However, unlike human ICAM-2, expression of pig ICAM-2 on cultured endothelial cells was not down-regulated by treatment with the inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. Pig ICAM-2 expressed on stable transfectants supported firm adhesion of cells expressing human LFA-1. This conservation of function across the species barrier suggests that pig ICAM-2 plays a role in the cellular interactions associated with xenograft rejection.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2004
19463875,Characterization of putative GRP- and NMB-receptor antagonist's interaction with human receptors.,"The mammalian bombesin (Bn) peptides neuromedin B (NMB) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) actions are mediated by two receptors (NMB-receptor, GRP-receptor) which are widely distributed in the GI tract and CNS. From primarily animal studies NMB/GRP-receptor activation has physiological/pathophysiological effects in the CNS and GI tract including stimulating of growth of cancers and normal tissues. Whereas these Bn-receptors' effects have been extensively studied in nonhuman cells and animals, little is known of the physiological/pathological role(s) in humans, largely due to lack of potent antagonists. To address this issue we compared NMB/GRP-receptor affinity/potency of 10 chemical classes of putative antagonists (35 compounds) for human Bn-receptors by performing binding studies or assessing abilities to activate hGRP/hNMB-receptor [assessing phospholipase C activation] in four different cells containing native Bn-receptors or transfected receptors. From binding studies 23 were GRP-receptor-preferring, 4 were NMB-receptor, and 8 nonselective. For the hGRP-receptor-preferring analogues none showed hGRP-receptor agonist activity, but 13 were full or partial hNMB-receptor agonists at hNMB-receptors. For hNMB-receptor-preferring analogues none were agonists. Analogue #24 ([(3-Ph-Pr(6)), His(7), d-Ala(11), d-Pro(13), Psi(13-14), Phe(14)]Bn(6-14)NH2) and analogue #7 [d-Phe(6), Leu(13), Psi(CH(2)NH), Cpa(14)]Bn(6-14) were the most potent (0.2-1.4nM) and selective (>10,000-fold) for the hGRP-receptor with analogue #7.5 [d-Tpi(6), Leu(13), Psi(CH2NH), Leu(14)]Bn(6-14)[RC-3095] (0.2-1.4nM) slightly less selective. Analogue #34 (PD168368) had the highest affinity for hNMB-receptor (1.32-1.58nM) and the greatest selectivity (2298-6952-fold) for the hNMB-receptor. These results demonstrate numerous putative hGRP/hNMB-receptor antagonists identified in nonhuman cells and/or animals have agonist activity at the hNMB-receptor, limiting their potential usefulness. However, a number were identified which were potent/selective for human Bn-receptors and should be useful for investigating their roles in human physiological/pathophysiological conditions.",,
7759550,Characterization of recombinant extracellular domain of human interleukin-10 receptor.,"The extracellular region of the human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) receptor was expressed using a myeloma cell line and was purified to homogeneity by ligand-affinity chromatography. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that the soluble receptor is glycosylated and has an apparent molecular mass of 35,000-45,000. Under native conditions, soluble hIL-10 receptor was determined by gel filtration to be a monomeric protein. Soluble hIL-10 receptor was able to inhibit the binding of 125I-hIL-10 to the full-length receptor and was able to antagonize the effect of human IL-10 in cell proliferation and cytokine synthesis inhibition. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of soluble hIL-10 receptor was determined to be 563 +/- 59 pM, approximately 2- to 10-fold higher than that found on intact cells (Tan, J. C., Indelicato, S. R., Narula, S. K., Zavodny, P. J., and Chou, C.-C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 21053-21059; Liu, Y., Wei, S. H.-Y., Ho, A. S.-Y., de Waal Malefyt, R., and Moore, K. W. (1994) J. Immunol. 152, 1821-1829). When hIL-10 binds soluble hIL-10 receptor in solution, a single complex was detected by gel filtration, and the complex was found to consist of two hIL-10 dimers and four soluble receptor monomers, suggesting that hIL-10 may induce a novel mode of oligomerization of the receptor upon binding.",,
9582367,Characterization of recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-10 reveals functional similarities with keratinocyte growth factor (FGF-7).,"A newly identified member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, designated FGF-10, is expressed during development and preferentially in adult lung. The predicted FGF-10 protein is most related to keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, or FGF-7). The latter is unique among FGFs in that it binds and signals only through the FGF receptor (FGFR2b) isoform KGF receptor (KGFR) expressed specifically by epithelial cells. In order to examine the biological and biochemical properties of human FGF-10, we isolated the cDNA and expressed its encoded protein in bacteria. The recombinant protein (rFGF-10) was a potent mitogen for Balb/MK mouse epidermal keratinocytes with activity detectable at 0.1 nM and maximal at around 5 nM. Within this concentration range, FGF-10 did not stimulate DNA synthesis in NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts. rFGF-10 bound the KGFR with high affinity comparable to that of KGF, and did not bind detectably to either the FGFR1c (Flg) or FGFR2c (Bek) receptor isoforms. The mitogenic activity of FGF-10 could be distinguished from that of KGF by its different sensitivity to heparin and lack of neutralization by a KGF monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that FGF-10 and KGF have similar receptor binding properties and target cell specificities, but are differentially regulated by components of the extracellular matrix.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
10498827,Characterization of recombinant human orexin receptor pharmacology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell-line using FLIPR.,"The cellular mechanisms underlying the physiological effects of the orexins are poorly understood. Therefore, the pharmacology of the recombinant human orexin receptors was studied using FLIPR. Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) was monitored in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing orexin-1 (OX1) or orexin-2 (OX2) receptors using Fluo-3AM. Orexin-A and orexin-B increased [Ca2+]i in a concentration dependent manner in CHO-OX1 (pEC50=8.03+/-0.08 and 7. 30+/-0.08 respectively, n=5) and CHO-OX2 (pEC50=8.18+/-0.10 and 8. 43+/-0.09 respectively, n=5) cells. This response was typified as a rapid peak in [Ca2+]i (maximal at 6 - 8 s), followed by a gradually declining secondary phase. Thapsigargin (3 microM) or U73122 (3 microM) abolished the response. In calcium-free conditions the peak response was unaffected but the secondary phase was shortened, returning to basal values within 90 s. Calcium (1.5 mM) replacement restored the secondary phase. In conclusion, orexins cause a phospholipase C-mediated release of calcium from intracellular stores, with subsequent calcium influx.",,
11375980,Characterization of Slit protein interactions with glypican-1.,"We have demonstrated previously that the Slit proteins, which are involved in axonal guidance and related developmental processes in nervous tissue, are ligands of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1 in brain (Liang, Y., Annan, R. S., Carr, S. A., Popp, S., Mevissen, M., Margolis, R. K., and Margolis, R. U. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 17885--17892). To characterize these interactions in more detail, recombinant human Slit-2 protein and the N- and C-terminal portions generated by in vivo proteolytic processing were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the binding of a glypican-Fc fusion protein. Saturable and reversible high affinity binding to the full-length protein and to the C-terminal portion that is released from the cell membrane was seen, with dissociation constants in the 80-110 nm range, whereas only a relatively low level of binding to the larger N-terminal segment was detected. Co-transfection of 293 cells with Slit and glypican-1 cDNAs followed by immunoprecipitation demonstrated that these interactions also occur in vivo, and immunocytochemical studies showed colocalization in the embryonic and adult central nervous system. The binding affinity of the glypican core protein to Slit is an order of magnitude lower than that of the glycanated proteoglycan. Glypican binding to Slit was also decreased 80--90% by heparin (2 microg/ml), enzymatic removal of the heparan sulfate chains, and by chlorate inhibition of glypican sulfation. The differential effects of N- or O-desulfated heparin on glypican binding also indicate that O-sulfate groups on the heparan sulfate chains play a critical role in heparin interactions with Slit. Our data suggest that glypican binding to the releasable C-terminal portion of Slit may serve as a mechanism for regulating the biological activity of Slit and/or the proteoglycan.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
7995952,Characterization of surface lymphotoxin forms. Use of specific monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptors.,"Lymphotoxin (LT) is a cytokine related to TNF, found in human systems in both secreted and membrane bound forms. The well characterized secreted form is a trimer of a single protein, LT-alpha, whereas the surface form is composed of a complex between two related molecules, LT-alpha and LT-beta. Because there is a distinct receptor for the complex, the membrane form is believed to signal via events different from those elicited by TNF and secreted LT-alpha. By using a battery of anti-LT-alpha and LT-beta mAbs, it is clear that two LT surface forms exist on the surface of PMA-activated II-23 cells, a human T cell hybridoma. Assuming that these surface forms are trimers, a minor form appears early after induction having an apparent stoichiometry of LT-alpha 2/beta 1 and is recognized by one group of anti-LT-alpha mAbs and the p55-TNF receptor. The second and predominant form has an apparent LT-alpha 1/beta 2 composition and is recognized by a second group of pantrophic anti-LT-alpha mAbs and the LT-beta receptor. Neither of the heteromeric forms nor a putative LT-beta homotrimeric form were found to be secreted. The properties of surface LT on the II-23 cell system were similar to those of the surface LT forms on Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with both LT-alpha and LT-beta genes and a number of lymphoid tumor lines. These experiments point toward the LT-alpha 1/beta 2 complex as the predominant membrane form of LT on the lymphocyte surface, and this complex is the primary ligand for the LT-beta receptor.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1995
12954451,Characterization of tachykinin NK2 receptor in the anterior pituitary gland.,"Tachykinins are a family of bioactive peptides that interact with three subtypes of receptors: NK1, NK2 and NK3. Substance P has greater affinity for NK1, and neurokinin A (NKA) for NK2 receptor subtype. Although only NK1 receptor has been characterized in the anterior pituitary gland, some evidence suggests the existence of NK2 receptors in this gland. Therefore, we investigated the presence of NK2 receptors in the anterior pituitary gland of male rats by radioligand binding studies using labeled SR48968, a non peptidic specific antagonist. [3H]SR48968 specific binding to cultured anterior pituitary cells was time-dependent and saturable, but with a lower affinity than previously reported values for cells expressing NK2 receptors. Unlabeled NKA inhibited only partially [(3)H]SR48968 specific binding to whole anterior pituitary cells. Since SR48968 is a non polar molecule, we performed experiments to discriminate surface from intracellular binding sites. SR48968 exhibited both surface and intracellular specific binding. Analysis of the surface-bound ligand indicated that [3H]SR48968 binds to one class of receptor with high affinity. Neurokinin A completely displaced [3H]SR48968 surface specific binding fitting to a two-site/two-state model with high and low affinity. Additionally, immunocytochemical studies showed that the NK2 receptor is expressed at least in a subset of lactotropes. These results demonstrate the presence of NK2 receptors in the anterior pituitary gland and suggest that NKA actions in this gland are mediated, at least in part, by the NK2 receptor subtype.",,
9723709,"Characterization of TEK receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligands, Angiopoietins, in human hematopoietic progenitor cells.","TEK, or TIE-2, is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is known as a functioning molecule of vascular endothelial cells. TEK comprises a subfamily of RTK with TIE, and these two receptors play critical roles in vascular maturation, maintenance of integrity and remodeling. We generated mAb against the extracellular domain of human TEK protein to elucidate its expression pattern in human hematopoietic cells. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow cells revealed that TEK was expressed in 27% of CD34+ cells, 20% of c-KIT+ cells and 26% of CD34+CD38- cells, indicating that TEK is expressed in a subset of primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). TEK was also expressed in 20% of CD19+ B lymphocytes but not in other lineage-committed cells. Progenitor assays in methylcellulose culture showed that CD34+TEK+ cells formed significantly less BFU-E and CFU-Mix than CD34+TEK- cells, but there was no difference in the number of CFU-GM between these two populations. Two recently identified TEK ligands, termed Angiopoietin-1 and -2, bound to TEK with similar affinities, and Angiopoietin-1 effectively induced TEK phosphorylation in hematopoietic cells. Angiopoietin-2 also induced a low level of TEK phosphorylation and weakened the phosphorylation induced by Angiopoietin-1, suggestive of an elaborate regulator of the TEK-TEK ligand signaling pathway. Although neither ligands affected the proliferation of TEK-transfected hematopoietic cells or the colony formation of CD34+TEK+ bone marrow cells, both promoted the adhesion of TEK-transfected hematopoietic cells to a collagen matrix or a layer of bone marrow stromal cells. These findings indicate that the TEK-TEK ligand signaling pathway is regulated in a refined manner and is involved in hematopoietic cell-microenvironment interaction.",International immunology,1998
11030716,"Characterization of the binding of [(125)I]-human prolactin releasing peptide (PrRP) to GPR10, a novel G protein coupled receptor.","GPR10 is a novel G-protein coupled receptor that is the human orthologue of rat Unknown Hypothalamic Receptor-1 (UHR-1). Human prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) has been identified as an endogenous ligand for GPR10, and occurs as 31 and 20 amino acid forms. The present study characterizes the binding of [(125)I]-PrRP-20 to HEK293 cells stably expressing GPR10 receptors. Specific binding of [(125)I]-PrRP-20 was saturable, and analysis suggested evidence of both high and low affinity sites, with K:(D:) values of 0.026+/-0.006 and 0.57+/-0.14 nM respectively, and B(max) values of 3010+/-400 and 8570+/-2240 fmol mg protein(-1) respectively. Kinetic studies were unable to distinguish two sites, but single site analysis of association and dissociation data produced a K:(D:) of 0.012 nM. Competition studies revealed that human and rat PrRP-20 and PrRP-31 all display high affinity for GPR10. A range of other drugs which are known ligands at receptors which share limited homology with GPR10 were also tested. None of the drugs tested, including the RF-amide neuropeptide FF, demonstrated any affinity for GPR10. Human PrRP-20 failed to alter basal or forskolin-stimulated levels of intracellular cyclic AMP in HEK293-GPR10 cells, suggesting that GPR10 does not couple via either G(s) or G(i). Functional studies using measurements of intracellular calcium confirmed that human and rat PrRP-20 and PrRP-31 are all potent, full agonists at the GPR10 receptor. The response was blocked both by thapsigargin, indicating mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) stores. These studies indicate that [(125)I]-PrRP-20 is a specific, high affinity radioligand for GPR10. The availability of this radioligand binding assay will be a valuable tool for the investigation of the key features involved in PrRP binding and studies on the localization and function of GPR10.",,
8904635,Characterization of the binding of endothelin ETB selective ligands in human and rat heart.,"1. We determined competition binding characteristics of endothelin ETB receptor selective ligands in human left ventricle and compared these values to those obtained with rat left ventricle. Sarafotoxin S6c, ET-3, BQ788 and IRL2500 competed against [125I]-PD151242 (ETA selective radioligand) with low affinity in human left ventricle, confirming the ETB selectivity of these compounds. 2. ET-3 competed with moderate selectivity for ETB over ETA receptors in human left ventricle and with slightly higher selectivity in rat left ventricle (460 and 1,400 fold, respectively). There was a small difference in the affinity of ETA receptors for ET-3 (KD ETA in human left ventricle = 0.07 +/- 0.02 microM; KD ETA in rat left ventricle = 0.27 +/- 0.08 microM; P = 0.05) but no difference in the affinity of ETB receptors for this ligand (KD ETB in human left ventricle = 0.15 +/- 0.06 nM; KD ETB in rat left ventricle = 0.19 +/- 0.03 nM). 3. The selectivity of sarafotoxin S6c for ETB over ETA receptors in human left ventricle was 5,900 fold compared with 59,400 fold in rat left ventricle. The affinity of ETA receptors for sarafotoxin S6c was higher in human than in rat left ventricle (KD ETA = 2.00 +/- 0.20 microM and 3.50 +/- 0.26 microM, respectively; P = 0.03), while the affinity of ETB receptors for this ligand was higher in rat left ventricle (KD ETB = 0.06 +/- 0.02 nM) than in human left ventricle (KD ETB = 0.34 +/- 0.13 nM) (P = 0.02). The affinity of ETB receptors for sarafotoxin S6c in rat left ventricle determined in the absence or presence of GTP was the same indicating that differing affinity states of ETB receptors in human and rat left ventricle do not account for the variation observed between species. 4. There was no difference in the affinity of ETA receptors for BQ788 (KD ETA = 1.01 +/- 0.20 microM and KD ETA = 1.39 +/- 0.35 microM) or for the novel ETB selective antagonist. IRL2500 (KD ETA = 30.0 +/- 20.8 microM and KD ETA = 55.6 +/- 9.93 microM) in human and rat left ventricle, respectively. ETB receptors had a significantly higher affinity for BQ788 (KD ETB = 9.8 +/- 1.3 nM and KD ETB = 31.0 +/- 5.4 nM; P = 0.02) and IRL2500 (KD ETB = 78.2 +/- 9.7 nM and KD ETB = 300.0 +/- 75.1 nM; P = 0.03) in human and rat left ventricle, respectively. The synthetically synthesized ETB selective antagonist RES-701-1 (0.1 -3 microM) failed to inhibit [125I]-ET-1 binding in either tissue. 5. In conclusion, we have compared equilibrium dissociation constants for a number of ETB selective compounds in human and rat heart. The affinity of ETB receptors for sarafotoxin S6c, BQ788 and IRL2500 differed in human and rat left ventricle. No difference in affinity was detected for ET-3 binding at ETB receptors. Sarafotoxin S6c binding was unaffected by GTP indicating that the different receptor affinities in human and rat heart cannot be explained by differing ETB receptor affinity states. This study highlights the need to consider differences in binding characteristics that may arise from the use of tissues obtained from different species.",,
7682062,"Characterization of the binding sites of [3H]SR 48968, a potent nonpeptide radioligand antagonist of the neurokinin-2 receptor.","[3H]SR 48968, a radiolabeled nonpeptide antagonist of NK-2 receptor, has been tested in ligand-receptor binding assays using rat duodenum, hamster urinary bladder and guinea pig ileum membranes. [3H]SR 48968 bound to a single class of high affinity binding sites. Its affinity was slightly species-dependent. Its binding was inhibited by neurokinins, following the rank order of potency NKA > NKB > SP. It was also inhibited by peptide antagonists of NK-2 receptor (MEN 10,376, L 659,877), but their relative potencies were highly species-dependent. Unlabeled SR 48968, but not its R-enantiomer (SR 48965), also potently inhibited its binding. These data show that [3H]SR 48968 potently binds to NK-2 receptor and therefore is a useful tool to study NK-2 receptor.",,
12960329,Characterization of the CD200 receptor family in mice and humans and their interactions with CD200.,"CD200 (OX2) is a broadly distributed cell surface glycoprotein that interacts with a structurally related receptor (CD200R) expressed on rodent myeloid cells and is involved in regulation of macrophage function. We report the first characterization of human CD200R (hCD200R) and define its binding characteristics to hCD200. We also report the identification of a closely related gene to hCD200R, designated hCD200RLa, and four mouse CD200R-related genes (termed mCD200RLa-d). CD200, CD200R, and CD200R-related genes were closely linked in humans and mice, suggesting that these genes arose by gene duplication. The distributions of the receptor genes were determined by quantitative RT-PCR, and protein expression was confirmed by a set of novel mAbs. The distribution of mouse and human CD200R was similar, with strongest labeling of macrophages and neutrophils, but also other leukocytes, including monocytes, mast cells, and T lymphocytes. Two mCD200 receptor-like family members, designated mCD200RLa and mCD200RLb, were shown to pair with the activatory adaptor protein, DAP12, suggesting that these receptors would transmit strong activating signals in contrast to the apparent inhibitory signal delivered by triggering the CD200R. Despite substantial sequence homology with mCD200R, mCD200RLa and mCD200RLb did not bind mCD200, and presently have unknown ligands. The CD200 receptor gene family resembles the signal regulatory proteins and killer Ig-related receptors in having receptor family members with potential activatory and inhibitory functions that may play important roles in immune regulation and balance. Because manipulation of the CD200-CD200R interaction affects the outcome of rodent disease models, targeting of this pathway may have therapeutic utility.",,
11519828,Characterization of the Epha1 receptor tyrosine kinase: expression in epithelial tissues.,"The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases plays a crucial role during development and is implicated in oncogenesis. Using a partial cDNA clone of an Eph-related kinase (Esk) we isolated the complete coding region of a gene which we show to be murine EphA1 by both structural and functional criteria. The chromosomal localization is shown to be syntenic to hEphA1 and the genomic organization also shows distinct features found in the hEphA1 gene. Functionally, in keeping with findings for the human homologue, both soluble recombinant and ""native"" mEphA1 show preferential binding to ephrin A1. However, we also observed significant binding to other A-type ligands as has been observed for other Eph receptors. We analysed the expression of mEphA1 mRNA by in situ hybridization on tissue sections. mEphA1 was expressed in epithelial elements of skin, adult thymus, kidney and adrenal cortex. Taken together with previous Northern blotting data these results suggest that mEphA1 is expressed widely in differentiated epithelial cells.","Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",2001
14722252,Characterization of the human calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor subtypes associated with receptor activity-modifying proteins.,"Coexpression of receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) with calcitonin receptor 2 (CTR2) or calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) leads to the formation of four functional heterodimeric receptors for human calcitonin gene-related peptide (hCGRP). In this study, we transfected hCGRP receptors into human embryonic kidney 293 cells and examined their pharmacological profiles using three dominant-negative (DN) RAMP mutants and various hCGRPalpha analogs. Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis revealed that their cotransfection with CTR2 induced cell surface expression of all three RAMPs, and the three CTR2/RAMP heterodimers mediated equivalent levels of cAMP production in response to hCGRPalpha that were approximately 50-fold greater than were seen with CTR2 alone. By contrast, [Tyr0]hCGRPalpha binding and signaling were markedly weaker with CTR2/RAMP2 or -3 than with CTR2/RAMP1 or CRLR/RAMP1; likewise, 125I-[His10]hCGRPalpha bound most potently to CTR2/RAMP1. When CTR2 was coexpressed with DN RAMP1 or -2, hCGRPalpha-evoked responses were similar to those seen with CTR2 alone, despite the expression of both CTR2 and DN RAMP at the cell surface. But coexpression of DN RAMP3 with CTR2 significantly diminished hCGRPalpha signaling compared with that seen with CTR2 alone, indicating that DN RAMP3 is able to function as a negative regulator of CTR2 function. Competition experiments showed the relative agonist sensitivity of the four receptors to be hCGRPalpha > [Tyr0]hCGRPalpha > [Cys(Et)2,7]hCGRPalpha > [Cys(ACM)2,7]hCGRPalpha. Of the linear analogs, [Cys(ACM)2,7]hCGRPalpha (ACM, acetylmethoxy) enhanced cAMP formation only via CTR2/RAMP1, whereas [Cys(Et2,7)]hCGRPalpha acted via CRLR/RAMP1 and somewhat less potently via CTR2/RAMP1. Thus, among the three CGRP8-37-insensitive receptors, CTR2/RAMP1 is most sensitive to the two linear analogs, suggesting that it could be classified as a CGRP2 receptor. Moreover, the combined use of iodinated CGRPalpha analogs may be useful for defining the CGRP1 receptor.",,
2828352,Characterization of the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor.,"Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine derived from activated T cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages. It stimulates myeloid and erythroid progenitors to form colonies in semisolid medium in vitro, as well as enhancing multiple differentiated functions of mature neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils. We have examined the binding of human GM-CSF to a variety of responsive human cells and cell lines. The most mature myelomonocytic cells, specifically human neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils, express the highest numbers of a single class of high affinity receptors (Kd approximately 37 pM, 293-1000 sites/cell). HL-60 and KG-1 cells exhibit an increase in specific binding at high concentrations of GM-CSF; computer analysis of the data is nonetheless consistent with a single class of high affinity binding sites with a Kd approximately 43 pM and 20-450 sites/cell. Dimethyl sulfoxide induces a 3-10-fold increase in high affinity receptors expressed in HL-60 cells, coincident with terminal neutrophilic differentiation. Finally, binding of 125I-GM-CSF to fresh peripheral blood cells from six patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia was analyzed. In three of six cases, binding was similar to the nonsaturable binding observed with HL-60 and KG-1 cells. GM-CSF binding was low, or in some cases, undetectable on myeloblasts obtained from eight patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. The observed affinities of the receptor for GM-CSF are consistent with all known biological activities. Affinity labeling of both normal neutrophils and dimethyl sulfoxide-induced HL-60 cells with unglycosylated 125I-GM-CSF yielded a band of 98 kDa, implying a molecular weight of approximately 84,000 for the human GM-CSF receptor.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1988
7475979,Characterization of the human oxytocin receptor stably expressed in 293 human embryonic kidney cells.,"The human oxytocin (OT) receptor was stably expressed in 293 embryonic kidney cells (293/OTR), characterized pharmacologically and compared to human uterine myometrial receptors. The cloned receptor is expressed at a reasonably high density (0.82 fmole/microgram protein) and exhibits high affinity for [3H]OT (Kd = 0.32nM), similar to the value found in human myometrial tissue. The rank-order of potency for various antagonist and agonist ligands from several structural classes is also similar between the cloned and native receptor, as seen in a comparison of their inhibitory constants for [3H]OT binding. Agonist affinity at the cloned OT receptor is decreased by guanine nucleotide analogs, demonstrating functional G-protein-coupling. The OT receptor in 293 cells, like in human myometrium, is also coupled to the inositol phosphate pathway. In 293/OTR cells, OT stimulates inositol phosphate accumulation with an EC50 = 4.1 nM, an effect blocked by a potent and selective OT antagonist, L-366,948. Additionally, the cloned receptor in 293 cells desensitizes to high concentrations of OT, similar to the desensitization in myometrial tissue and also described for several other G-protein-coupled receptors. These results illustrate the utility of the 293 cell line for expressing human OT receptors in an environment quite comparable to the native myometrial tissue.",Life sciences,1995
1532572,Characterization of the integrin alpha v beta 6 as a fibronectin-binding protein.,"Integrins are a complex family of divalent cation-dependent cell adhesion receptors composed of one alpha and one beta subunit noncovalently bound to one another. A subset of integrins contains the alpha v subunit in association with one of several beta subunits (e.g. beta 3, beta 5, beta 1). We have recently identified a novel integrin beta subunit, beta 6, that is present in a number of epithelial cell lines. Using a polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of beta 6, we have now identified the integrin heterodimer, alpha v beta 6, on the surface of two human carcinoma cell lines. Using affinity chromatography of lysates from the pancreatic carcinoma cell line, FG-2, we demonstrate that alpha v beta 6 binds to fibronectin, but not to vitronectin or collagen I. In contrast, the alpha v beta 5 integrin, which is also expressed on FG-2 cells, binds exclusively to vitronectin. Immobilized collagen I does not interact with alpha v integrins, but binds beta 1-containing integrins. Both alpha v beta 6 and alpha v beta 5 are eluted from their respective immobilized ligands by a hexa-peptide containing the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). RGD is highly effective in the presence of Ca2+, somewhat less effective in Mg2+, and virtually inactive in Mn2+. These results suggest that alpha v beta 6 functions as an RGD-dependent fibronectin receptor in FG-2 carcinoma cells. In agreement with this notion, cell adhesion assays show that FG-2 cell attachment to fibronectin is only partially inhibited by anti-beta 1 integrin antibodies, implying that other fibronectin receptors may be involved. Taken together with recent reports on the vitronectin receptor function of alpha v beta 5, our results suggest that the previously described carcinoma cell integrin, alpha v beta x (Cheresh, D. A., Smith, J. W., Cooper, H. M., and Quaranta, V. (1989) Cell 57, 59-69), is a mixture of at least two different receptors: alpha v beta 5, mediating adhesion to vitronectin, and alpha v beta 6, mediating adhesion to fibronectin.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1992
14522992,Characterization of the interaction of a recombinant soluble neuroligin-1 with neurexin-1beta.,"Neuroligins, proteins of the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family, are found as postsynaptic transmembrane proteins whose extracellular domain associates with presynaptic partners, proteins of the neurexin family. To characterize the molecular basis of neuroligin interaction with neurexin-beta, we expressed five soluble and exportable forms of neuroligin-1 from recombinant DNA sources, by truncating the protein before the transmembrane span near its carboxyl terminus. The extracellular domain of functional neuroligin-1 associates as a dimer when analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium. By surface plasmon resonance, we established that soluble neuroligins-1 bind neurexin-1beta, but the homologous alpha/beta-hydrolase fold protein, acetylcholinesterase, failed to associate with the neurexins. Neuroligin-1 has a unique N-linked glycosylation pattern in the neuroligin family, and glycosylation and its processing modify neuroligin activity. Incomplete processing of the protein and enzymatic removal of the oligosaccharides chain or the terminal sialic acids from neuroligin-1 enhance its activity, whereas deglycosylation of neurexin-1beta did not alter its association capacity. In particular, the N-linked glycosylation at position 303 appears to be a major determinant in modifying the association with neurexin-1beta. We show here that glycosylation processing of neuroligin, in addition to mRNA splicing and gene selection, contributes to the specificity of the neurexin-beta/neuroligin-1 association.",,
11003391,Characterization of the mouse interleukin-13 receptor alpha1 gene.,"Interleukin (IL)-13 is a pleiotropic immune regulatory cytokine that shares structural and biological characteristics with IL-4. The receptor for IL-13 is comprised of the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Ralpha) subunit and a low-affinity IL-13-binding subunit, IL-13Ralpha1. An additional receptor, IL-13Ralpha2, binds to IL-13 with high affinity, but lacks the cytoplasmic domain for signaling. In this study, we isolated the mouse IL-13Ralpha1 gene (Il13ra1) of approximately 56 kb that spans the entire coding region. The mouse Il13ra1 gene is composed of 11 exons, and shows striking similarity in genomic structure to the previously reported class I cytokine receptor genes. Motifs characteristic of the cytokine receptor family are similarly organized on the genome, including conserved cysteines, a WSxWS motif, and Box1, indicating closely related genetic evolution of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Alternative mRNA splicings were demonstrated to generate variant transcripts that encode soluble IL-13Ralpha1. The mouse Ill13ra1 gene was mapped to the proximal region of the mouse X chromosome, and was closely linked to the DXPas3 locus by interspecific backcross analysis. Il13ra1 mRNA was co-expressed with I14ra mRNA in mouse myeloid and natural killer cells on which IL-13 has been known to act, whereas the Il13ra2 mRNA was not detected in these cells, indicating that IL-13Ralpha1 is the major component of the IL-13 receptor complex in lymphohematopoietic cells.",Immunogenetics,2000
12609745,Characterization of the NPGP receptor and identification of a novel short mRNA isoform in human hypothalamus.,"Recently, an orphan G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) termed NPGPR was described. A shorter variant of this receptor lacking exon 1 was shown to have subnanomolar affinity for neuropeptide FF (NPFF), a pain modulatory peptide, and therefore was named NPFF(2) receptor. Here, we characterize the full-length cloned NPGPR and identify a novel short form lacking exon 2 with a differential pattern of mRNA abundance in several tissues and organs. The NPGPR is most similar to the recently cloned neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor which lacks exon 1, but also shows high homology to the orexin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor families, two neuropeptides involved in food intake regulation. Therefore, we used binding studies to examine the interaction of NPFF, orexin and NPY with the NPGPR. [125I] NPFF was displaced by NPFF with an IC(50) of 14.7 +/- 8.8 nM, whereas [125I] Orexin B was displaced by Orexin B with an IC(50) of 415 +/- 195 nM. We conclude that orexins interact with the NPGPR and that the affinity of NPFF for NPGPR is approximately 100-fold lower than for the NPFF2 receptor. We postulate that NPGPR is a splice variant of the family of NPFF receptors and displays a binding profile different from the other members of the NPFF receptor family due to the presence of exon 1. In order to evaluate whether NPGPR levels are affected by the feeding status, we examined the mRNA level using real-time PCR in two feeding models, i.e. before and after diet-induced body weight increase as well as after chronic food restriction in rats. However, hypothalamic NPGPR mRNA was unchanged in both models. Therefore, our evidence does not support the hypothesis that NPGPR is involved in feeding regulation.",Regulatory peptides,2003
17174565,Characterization of the receptors for axon guidance factor netrin-4 and identification of the binding domains.,"Netrins are a family of secreted protein related to laminin and act as tropic cues directing axon growth and cell migration during neural development. Netrin-4 is a novel member of netrin family recently identified in the vertebrate with neuritis elongation promoting activity; however, the receptors for netrin-4 are still unknown. To better understand the function and signal transduction pathway of netrin-4, the potential receptors for netrin-4 were studied in this paper. The netrin-4 protein was prepared by introducing a eukaryotic expression vector with a secretable alkaline phosphatase tag (AP4) into COS7 cells to allow the expression of AP4-netrin4 fusion protein. Axon guidance activity of netrin-4 was confirmed by using the cortical explants. After incubation with cultured primary cortical neurons, the neurons were distinctly labeled by the AP4-coupled netrin-4 ligands. In contrast, the binding activity of AP4-netrin4 to neurons could be completely competed by the exogenously expressed netrin-4 protein without AP4 tag, indicating specificity of netrin-4 binding to the potential receptors. Moreover, netrin-4 could also bind to CHO cells transfected with the plasmids expressing two known receptors for netrin-1, Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and UNC5 homolog 1 (UNC5H1) respectively. As there are three domains in netrin-4, we further tried to narrow down the region containing binding sites with the receptors. Interestingly, only the N-terminal domain (LNT) could bind to DCC and UNC5H1. A further ligand-receptor binding analysis showed that both the N- and the C-terminal domain (NCT) but not the EGF-like (EGFL) domain of netrin-4 could bind to the surface of cultured primary neurons, indicating the existence of novel receptors for netrin-4. After competed by netrin-4, we confirmed that the binding of AP tagged netrin-4 domains to neurons were also netrin-4 dependent. The binding activity of the N-terminal domain of netrin-4 is about 3-fold higher than that for the C-terminal domain. In summary, our data here indicated that the two known receptors for netrin-1, DCC and UNC5H1, are also receptors for netrin-4, while only LNT but not EGFL and NCT is the key domain for specific binding. In addition, there are novel receptors for netrin-4, where both LNT and NCT but not EGFL are key domains for binding.",Molecular and cellular neurosciences,2007
14580208,Characterization of the recombinant extracellular domains of human interleukin-20 receptors and their complexes with interleukin-19 and interleukin-20.,"The soluble extracellular domains of human interleukin-20 (IL-20) receptors I and II (sIL-20R1 and sIL20R2), along with their ligands IL-19 and IL-20, were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells and purified to homogeneity. Formation of the receptor/receptor and ligand/receptor complexes was studied by size exclusion chromatography. Both ligands and soluble receptors were found to be monomeric in solution; homo- or heterodimers are not formed even at elevated concentrations. Under native conditions, both IL-19 and IL-20 form stable ternary 1:1:1 complexes with the sIL-20R1 and sIL20R2 receptors, as well as high-affinity binary complexes with sIL-20R2. Unexpectedly, sIL-20R1 does not bind on its own to either IL-19 or IL-20. Thus, one of the possible consecutive mechanisms of formation of the signaling ternary complex may involve two steps: first, the ligand binds to receptor II, creating a high-affinity binding site for the receptor I, and only then does receptor I complete the complex.",Biochemistry,2003
12427015,Characterization of the role of the N-loop of MIP-1 beta in CCR5 binding.,"MIP-1beta is a CC-chemokine that plays a role in inflammation and host defense mechanisms by interacting with its specific receptor CCR5. CCR5 is a major coreceptor for macrophage-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and as a consequence, MIP-1beta can inhibit HIV entry. It is therefore of interest to understand how MIP-1beta and other CCR5 ligands bind to their receptor, as such understanding could lead to the rational design of more efficient HIV entry blockers. We have previously demonstrated the importance of Phe13, and of basic residues of the 40's loop, in mediating high-affinity binding of MIP-1beta to CCR5. We have now investigated further the relative contribution of other MIP-1beta residues in the interaction of the chemokine with CCR5, by studying the functional consequences of point mutations within the N-loop and the 3(10) turn of MIP-1beta, affecting the charge, size, and H-bonding properties of the side chains. Our data suggest that, in addition to Phe13, three amino acids of the N-loop and 3(10) turn (Arg18, Lys19, and Arg22) interact with CCR5 through their positive charge. We also found that Pro21 contributes to the CCR5 binding properties of MIP-1beta. Moreover, NMR spectroscopy has revealed that the presence of Tyr at position 15 is necessary for the proper folding of the chemokine. Our results therefore demonstrate that the binding determinants of MIP-1beta consist of residues arranged on one surface of the protein, including most of the basic residues in MIP-1beta, as well as two key hydrophobic groups. The good correlation observed between the potency of the mutants in a functional assay and their binding affinity strongly argues that basic residues Arg18, Lys19, and Arg22 of MIP-1beta are essential for its CCR5 binding properties, without a primary effect on CCR5 activation.",,
9886417,"Characterization of the signal transduction pathway activated in human monocytes and dendritic cells by MPIF-1, a specific ligand for CC chemokine receptor 1.","The receptor specificity and signal transduction pathway has been identified and characterized for a truncated form of myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor-1 (MPIF-1(24-99)). MPIF-1 binds specifically to sites, in particular CCR1, shared with macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) on the surface of human monocytes and dendritic cells, as inferred by its ability to compete for [125I]MIP-1alpha, but not for [125I]MIP-1beta or [125I]monocyte chemotactic protein-1(MCP-1) binding to intact cells. Based on calcium flux, MPIF-1 is an agonist on CCR1-transfected HEK-293 cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells, but not on CCR5-, CCR8-, or CX3CR1-transfected cells. The inhibitory effect of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio-triphosphate) (GTP-gammaS) or pertussis toxin pretreatment on MPIF-1 binding and calcium mobilization, respectively, indicates the involvement of G proteins in the interaction of MPIF-1 and its receptor(s). The increase in intracellular free calcium concentration following MPIF-1 treatment is mainly due to the influx of calcium from an extracellular pool. However, a portion of the intracellular free calcium concentration is derived from a phospholipase C inhibitor-sensitive intracellular pool. MPIF-1 induces a rapid dose-dependent release of [3H]arachidonic acid from monocytes that is dependent on extracellular calcium and is blocked by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors. Furthermore, PLA2 activation is shown to be necessary for filamentous actin formation in monocytes. Thus, the MPIF-1 signal transduction pathway appears to include binding to CCR1; transduction by G proteins; effector function by phospholipase C, protein kinase C, calcium flux, and PLA2; and cytoskeletal remodeling.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1999
1379593,Characterization of two high affinity human interleukin-8 receptors.,"Interleukin 8 (IL-8) and melanocyte growth-stimulatory activity/gro (MGSA) are structurally related proinflammatory cytokines that are chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils. Recently, cDNA clones encoding a high affinity IL-8 receptor (IL-8R-A) and a ""low affinity"" IL-8 receptor (IL-8R-B) have been isolated from human cDNA libraries. These two receptors have 77% amino acid identity and are members of the G protein-coupled superfamily of receptors with seven transmembrane domains. We have expressed these two receptors in mammalian cells and find that in this system both receptors bind IL-8 with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The receptor affinities differ for MGSA, however. IL-8R-A binds MGSA with low affinity (Kd approximately 450 nM); IL-8R-B binds MGSA with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The transfected cells respond to ligand binding with a transient increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. A Ca2+ response is found for IL-8R-A following the binding of IL-8; no response is found for MGSA. A Ca2+ response for IL-8R-B follows the binding of both ligands. Blot hybridization with oligonucleotide probes specific for the two receptors shows that mRNA for both receptors is present in human neutrophils. Analysis of IL-8 and MGSA binding data on neutrophils as well as Ca2+ response and desensitization data shows that the presence of these two IL-8 receptors on the cell surface can account for the profile of these two ligands on neutrophils.",,
9811851,Characterization of two patched receptors for the vertebrate hedgehog protein family.,"The multitransmembrane protein Patched (PTCH) is the receptor for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), a secreted molecule implicated in the formation of embryonic structures and in tumorigenesis. Current models suggest that binding of Shh to PTCH prevents the normal inhibition of the seven-transmembrane-protein Smoothened (SMO) by PTCH. According to this model, the inhibition of SMO signaling is relieved after mutational inactivation of PTCH in the basal cell nevus syndrome. Recently, PTCH2, a molecule with sequence homology to PTCH, has been identified. To characterize both PTCH molecules with respect to the various Hedgehog proteins, we have isolated the human PTCH2 gene. Biochemical analysis of PTCH and PTCH2 shows that they both bind to all hedgehog family members with similar affinity and that they can form a complex with SMO. However, the expression patterns of PTCH and PTCH2 do not fully overlap. While PTCH is expressed throughout the mouse embryo, PTCH2 is found at high levels in the skin and in spermatocytes. Because Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) is expressed specifically in the testis and is required for germ cell development, it is likely that PTCH2 mediates its activity in vivo. Chromosomal localization of PTCH2 places it on chromosome 1p33-34, a region deleted in some germ cell tumors, raising the possibility that PTCH2 may be a tumor suppressor in Dhh target cells.",,
24104458,Characterizing CEACAM5 interaction with CD8α and CD1d in intestinal homeostasis.,"Normal intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) could act as non-professional antigen-presenting cells, selectively activating CD8(+)-suppressor T cells. An epithelial cell surface glycoprotein, gp180, recognized by monoclonal antibodies B9 and L12 was determined to be critical in this process. Purification and sequence analysis of mAb B9 reactive material revealed amino-acid sequence homology with CEACAM5. We demonstrate that CEACAM5 has properties attributed to gp180, such as CD8α binding and activation of CD8-associated Lck. CEACAM5 is the only CEACAM member interacting with CD1d through the B3 domain. Its N domain (recognized by B9) is required for CD8α binding. Removal of the N-domain glycosylated residues reduces B9 recognition, CD8α binding affinity, and activation of LcK. Therefore, conformational changes in CEACAM5 glycosylation site are critical for its interaction with CD8α. CEACAM5-activated CD8(+) T cells acquire the ability to suppress the proliferation of CD4(+) T cells in vitro in the presence of interleukin (IL)-15 or IL-7. We provide new insights into the role of CEACAM5 and define its specific immunoregulatory properties among the CEACAMs expressed on IECs. We suggest that unique set of interactions between CEACAM5, CD1d, and CD8 render CD1d more class I-like molecule, facilitating antigen presentation and activation of CD8(+)-suppressor regulatory T cells.",,
9064356,"Chemokine receptor specific for IP10 and mig: structure, function, and expression in activated T-lymphocytes.","A human receptor that is selective for the CXC chemokines IP10 and Mig was cloned and characterized. The receptor cDNA has an open reading frame of 1104-bp encoding a protein of 368 amino acids with a molecular mass of 40,659 dalton. The sequence includes seven putative transmembrane segments characteristic of G-protein coupled receptors. It shares 40.9 and 40.3% identical amino acids with the two IL-8 receptors, and 34.2-36.9% identity with the five known CC chemokine receptors. The IP10/Mig receptor is highly expressed in IL-2-activated T lymphocytes, but is not detectable in resting T lymphocytes. B lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes.

The present observations suggest that the IP10/Mig receptor is involved in the selective recruitment of effector T cells.",,
9005985,Chemokine receptor usage by human eosinophils. The importance of CCR3 demonstrated using an antagonistic monoclonal antibody.,"Chemokines bind and signal through G-protein coupled seven transmembrane receptors. Various chemokine receptors are expressed on leukocytes, and these may impart selective homing of leukocyte subsets to sites of inflammation. Human eosinophils express the eotaxin receptor, CCR3, but respond to a variety of CC chemokines apart from eotaxin, including RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-2, MCP-3, and MCP-4. Here we describe a mAb, 7B11, that is selective for CCR3 and has the properties of a true receptor antagonist. 7B11 blocked binding of various radiolabeled chemokines to either CCR3 transfectants, or eosinophils. Pretreatment of eosinophils with this mAb blocked chemotaxis and calcium flux induced by all CCR3 ligands. In all individuals examined, including allergic and eosinophilic donors, > 95% of the response of eosinophils to eotaxin, RANTES, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MCP-4 was shown to be mediated through CCR3. The IL-8 receptors, particularly CXCR2, were induced on IL-5 primed eosinophils, however these eosinophils responded to CC chemokines in the same manner as unprimed eosinophils. These results demonstrate the importance of CCR3 for eosinophil responses, and the feasibility of completely antagonizing this receptor.",,

1335692,Chief cells possess a receptor with high affinity for PACAP and VIP that stimulates pepsinogen release.,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a 38-amino acid peptide of the secretin-vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) family. To investigate whether PACAP alters chief cell function, we prepared isolated chief cells (> 90% pure) from guinea pig stomach. PACAP-38, PACAP-27, VIP, and secretin all caused a threefold increase in pepsinogen release. The dose-response curves of PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP were biphasic, whereas with secretin it was not. The first phase comprised 40% of maximal release, and each of the three peptides (PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP) were equipotent (EC50 0.1-0.3 nM). For the second phase, comprising 60% of maximal release, the relative potencies were PACAP-38 > PACAP-27 = VIP. 125I-labeled secretin, 125I-VIP, and 125I-PACAP-27 all demonstrated saturable binding to chief cells. Binding of both 125I-PACAP-27 and 125I-VIP was inhibited completely and with similar potencies by PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP. Secretin had a > 500-fold lower affinity than PACAP-38 for displacing both 125I-PACAP-27 and 125I-VIP. With 125I-secretin, secretin was the most potent, and was 197 times more potent than PACAP-38, which was 6-8 times more potent than both PACAP-27 and VIP. We conclude that both PACAP-38 and PACAP-27 stimulate pepsinogen secretion from dispersed chief cells. In contrast to a number of other tissues, no evidence for a high-affinity receptor that interacted only with PACAP was found. PACAP and VIP interact with equal high affinity with a common receptor and with low affinity with the secretin receptor.",The American journal of physiology,1992
8530375,Chimeric molecules between keratinocyte growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor define domains that confer receptor binding specificities.,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) are structurally related fibroblast growth factors, yet they exhibit distinct receptor binding specificity. Basic FGF binds with high affinity to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4, whereas KGF does not interact with these receptors and can only bind an isoform of FGFR2 known as the KGFR. Basic GFG binds KGFR but with lower affinity than KGF. In order to identify domains that confer this specificity, four reciprocal chimeras were generated between the two growth factors and were analyzed for receptor recognition and biological activity. The chimeras are designated BK1 (bFGF1-54:KGF91-194), BK2 (bFGF1-74:KGF111-194), KB1 (KGF31-90:bFGF55-155), and KB2 (KGF31-110:bFGF75-155). The two BK chimera similarly interacted with FGFR1 and FGFR4 but differed from each other with respect to KGFR recognition. BK1 displayed a slightly better affinity for KGFR than BK2 and induced a higher level of DNA synthesis in keratinocytes compared with bFGF and BK2. A neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against bFGF specifically neutralized the biological activity of the BK chimeras. The reciprocal chimeras, KB1 and KB2, exhibited KGF-like receptor binding and activation properties. However, KB2 displayed higher affinity for KGFR and was significantly more potent mitogen that KB1. Altogether, our results suggest that the amino-terminal part of KGF and bFGF plays an important role in determining their receptor binding specificity. In addition, the results point to the contribution of a segment from the middle part of KGF (residues 91-110) for recognition and activation of the KGFR, as the two chimeras containing these residues (BK1 and KB2) displayed an enhanced interaction with the KGFR.",,

1281789,Ciliary neurotrophic factor induces acute-phase protein expression in hepatocytes.,"During inflammatory states, hepatocytes are induced to synthesize and secrete a group of proteins called acute-phase proteins. It has recently been shown that besides interleukin-6 (IL-6), related cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostation M and interleukin-11 are also mediators of the hepatic acute-phase response. All these mediators belong to the hematopoietic family of alpha-helical cytokines. Here we show that an additional member of this cytokine family, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), induces the hepatic acute-phase protein genes haptoglobin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin and beta-fibrinogen in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) and in primary rat hepatocytes with a time course and dose-response comparable with that of IL-6. Our next aim was to define the receptor components used by CNTF on hepatic cells. Using a cell-free binding assay we exclude that CNTF binds to the 80 kDa IL-6 receptor, a protein with significant homology to the CNTF receptor which has recently been cloned from neuroblastoma cells. In human hepatoma cells (Hep3B) which lack the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, CNTF was not able to induce acute-phase protein synthesis, indicating that this receptor protein may be part of the functional CNTF receptor on hepatic cells.",,
15655705,Circulation and degradation of GIP and GLP-1.,"The incretin hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are secreted from the intestinal K- and L-cells, respectively, but are immediately subject to rapid degradation. GLP-1 is found in two active forms, amidated GLP-1 (7-36) amide and glycine-extended GLP-1 (7-37), while GIP exists as a single 42 amino acid peptide. The aminopeptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), which is found in the endothelium of the local capillary bed within the intestinal wall, is important for the initial inactivation of both peptides, with GLP-1 being particularly readily degraded. DPP IV cleavage generates N-terminally truncated metabolites (GLP-1 (9-36) amide / (9-37) and GIP (3-42)), which are the major circulating forms. Subsequently, the peptides may be degraded by other enzymes and extracted in an organ-specific manner. However, other endogenous metabolites have not yet been identified, possibly because existing assays are unable either to recognize them or to differentiate them from the primary metabolites. Neutral endopeptidase 24.11 has been demonstrated to be able to degrade GLP-1 in vivo, but its relevance in GIP metabolism has not yet been established. Intact GLP-1 and GIP are inactivated during passage across the hepatic bed by DPP IV associated with the hepatocytes, and further degraded by the peripheral tissues, while the kidney is important for the final elimination of the metabolites.",Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,2004
20606624,Cis interaction between Semaphorin6A and Plexin-A4 modulates the repulsive response to Sema6A.,"The correct navigation of axons to their targets depends on guidance molecules in the extra-cellular environment. Differential responsiveness to a particular guidance cue is largely an outcome of disparity in the expression of its receptors on the reacting axons. Here, we show that the differential responsiveness of sympathetic and sensory neurons to the transmembrane Semaphorin Sema6A is mainly determined by its co-expression in the responding neurons. Both sympathetic and sensory neurons express the Sema6A receptor Plexin-A4, but only sympathetic neurons respond to it. The expression of Sema6A counteracts this responsiveness and is detected only in sensory neurons. Remarkably, sensory neurons that lack Sema6A gain sensitivity to it in a Plexin-A4-dependent manner. Using heterologus systems, we show that the co-expression of Sema6A and Plexin-A4 hinders the binding of exogenous ligand, suggesting that a Sema6A-Plexin-A4 cis interaction serves as an inhibitory mechanism. Finally, we provide evidence for differential modes of interaction in cis versus in trans. Thus, co-expression of a transmembrane cue together with its receptor can serve as a guidance response modulator.",The EMBO journal,2010
29981480,Class 4 Semaphorins and Plexin-B receptors regulate GABAergic and glutamatergic synapse development in the mammalian hippocampus.,"To understand how proper circuit formation and function is established in the mammalian brain, it is necessary to define the genes and signaling pathways that instruct excitatory and inhibitory synapse development. We previously demonstrated that the ligand-receptor pair, Sema4D and Plexin-B1, regulates inhibitory synapse development on an unprecedentedly fast time-scale while having no effect on excitatory synapse development. Here, we report previously undescribed synaptogenic roles for Sema4A and Plexin-B2 and provide new insight into Sema4D and Plexin-B1 regulation of synapse development in rodent hippocampus. First, we show that Sema4a, Sema4d, Plxnb1, and Plxnb2 have distinct and overlapping expression patterns in neurons and glia in the developing hippocampus. Second, we describe a requirement for Plexin-B1 in both the presynaptic axon of inhibitory interneurons as well as the postsynaptic dendrites of excitatory neurons for Sema4D-dependent inhibitory synapse development. Third, we define a new synaptogenic activity for Sema4A in mediating inhibitory and excitatory synapse development. Specifically, we demonstrate that Sema4A signals through the same pathway as Sema4D, via the postsynaptic Plexin-B1 receptor, to promote inhibitory synapse development. However, Sema4A also signals through the Plexin-B2 receptor to promote excitatory synapse development. Our results shed new light on the molecular cues that promote the development of either inhibitory or excitatory synapses in the mammalian hippocampus.",,
12974481,Class II cytokine receptors and their ligands: key antiviral and inflammatory modulators.,"Class II cytokine receptors were originally defined on the basis of sequence homologies in the extracellular domains of receptors for interferons (IFNs) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), and the ligands, known as class II cytokines, also have a common structure. More recently, a series of new receptors and cytokines that belong to this family have been discovered. The therapeutic potential of the 'old' members of this family, IFNs and IL-1, is recognized in the clinic, and the existence of structurally related molecules is raising expectations for additional clinical applications. In this review, I discuss both structural and biological data that are emerging about this family of receptors and ligands, to highlight the potential applications of modulating the activity of these cytokines.",Nature reviews.

17213806,CLCP1 interacts with semaphorin 4B and regulates motility of lung cancer cells.,"We previously established a highly metastatic subline, LNM35, from the NCI-H460 lung cancer cell line, and demonstrated upregulation of a novel gene, CLCP1 (CUB, LCCL-homology, coagulation factor V/VIII homology domains protein), in LNM35 and lung cancer specimens. In this study, we focused on the potential roles of that gene in cancer metastasis. First, we established stable LNM35 RNAi clones, in which CLCP1 expression was suppressed by RNAi, and found that their motility was significantly reduced, although growth rates were not changed. Next, in vitro selection of a phage display library demonstrated that a phage clone displaying a peptide similar to a sequence within the Sema domain of semaphorin 4B (SEMA4B) interacted with LNM35. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed interaction of CLCP1 with SEMA4B, regulation of CLCP1 protein by ubiquitination and proteasome degradation enhanced in the presence of SEMA4B. These results are the first to indicate that CLCP1 plays a role in cell motility, whereas they also showed that at least one of its ligands is SEMA4B and that their interaction mediates proteasome degradation by CLCP1. Although the physiological role of the interaction between CLCP1 and SEMA4B remains to be investigated, this novel gene may become a target of therapy to inhibit metastasis of lung cancers.",Oncogene,2007
12879005,Cleavage of metastasis suppressor gene product KiSS-1 protein/metastin by matrix metalloproteinases.,"A human placenta cDNA library was screened by the expression cloning method for gene products that interact with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and we isolated a cDNA whose product formed a stable complex with pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9. The cDNA encoded the metastasis suppressor gene KiSS-1. KiSS-1 protein was shown to form a complex with pro-MMP. KiSS-1 protein is known to be processed to peptide ligand of a G-protein-coupled receptor (hOT7T175) named metastin, and suppresses metastasis of tumors expressing the receptor. Active MMP-2, MMP-9, MT1-MMP, MT3-MMP and MT5-MMP cleaved the Gly118-Leu119 peptide bond of not only full-length KiSS-1 protein but also metastin decapeptide. Metastin decapeptide induced formation of focal adhesion and actin stress fibers in cells expressing the receptor, and digestion of metastin decapeptide by MMP abolished its ligand activity. Migration of HT1080 cells expressing hOT7T175 that harbor a high-level MMP activity was only slightly suppressed by either metastin decapeptide or MMP inhibitor BB-94 alone, but the combination of metastin decapeptide and BB-94 showed a synergistic effect in blocking cell migration. We propose that metastin could be used as an antimetastatic agent in combination with MMP inhibitor, or MMP-resistant forms of metastin could be developed and may also be efficacious.",Oncogene,2003
10845911,Cleaved high molecular weight kininogen binds directly to the integrin CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) and blocks adhesion to fibrinogen and ICAM-1.,"High molecular weight kininogen (HK) and its cleaved form (HKa) have been shown to bind to neutrophils. Based on studies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we postulated that CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) might be the receptor on the neutrophils for binding to HK/HKa. However, the direct interaction of HK/HKa and Mac-1 had not been demonstrated. We therefore transfected HEK 293 cells with human Mac-1. Cell binding assays using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled HKa showed increased binding to the Mac-1 transfected cells compared with the control transfected cells. The binding was specific because unlabeled HKa, Mac-1-specific antibody, and fibrinogen can inhibit the binding of biotin-HKa to Mac-1 transfected cells. HKa bound to Mac-1 transfected cells (20 000 molecules/cell) with a K(d) = 62 nmol/L. To demonstrate directly the formation of a complex between HKa and Mac-1, we examined the interaction of HKa and purified Mac-1 in a cell-free system using an IAsys resonant mirror optical biosensor. The association and dissociation rate constants (k(on) and k(off), respectively) were determined, and they yielded a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 3.2x10(-9) mol/L. The functional significance of direct interaction of HKa to Mac-1 was investigated by examining the effect of HKa on cellular adhesion to fibrinogen and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), molecules abundant in the injured vessel wall. HKa blocked the adhesion of Mac-1 transfected cells to fibrinogen and ICAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, HKa may interrupt Mac-1-mediated cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell adhesive interactions and may therefore influence the recruitment of circulating neutrophils/monocytes to sites of vessel injury.

36399563,CLEC-1 is a death sensor that limits antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells and represents a target for cancer immunotherapy.,"Tumors exploit numerous immune checkpoints, including those deployed by myeloid cells to curtail antitumor immunity. Here, we show that the C-type lectin receptor CLEC-1 expressed by myeloid cells senses dead cells killed by programmed necrosis. Moreover, we identified Tripartite Motif Containing 21 (TRIM21) as an endogenous ligand overexpressed in various cancers. We observed that the combination of CLEC-1 blockade with chemotherapy prolonged mouse survival in tumor models. Loss of CLEC-1 reduced the accumulation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in tumors and invigorated the activation state of dendritic cells (DCs), thereby increasing T cell responses. Mechanistically, we found that the absence of CLEC-1 increased the cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens by conventional type-1 DCs. We identified antihuman CLEC-1 antagonist antibodies able to enhance antitumor immunity in CLEC-1 humanized mice. Together, our results demonstrate that CLEC-1 acts as an immune checkpoint in myeloid cells and support CLEC-1 as a novel target for cancer immunotherapy.",,
10966616,CLF associates with CLC to form a functional heteromeric ligand for the CNTF receptor complex.,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a cytokine supporting the differentiation and survival of various cell types in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Its receptor complex consists of a non-signaling alpha chain, CNTFR, and two signaling beta chains, gp130 and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Striking phenotypic differences between CNTF- and CNTFR-deficient mice suggest that CNTFR serves as a receptor for a second, developmentally important ligand. We have identified this factor as a stable secreted complex of cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) and the soluble receptor cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF). CLF expression was required for CLC secretion, and the complex acted only on cells expressing functional CNTF receptors. The CLF/CLC complex activated gp130, LIFR and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and supported motor neuron survival. Our results indicate that the CLF/CLC complex is a second ligand for CNTFR with potentially important implications in nervous system development.",,
11562786,Clinical aspects of disrupted Hedgehog signaling (Review).,"The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway is involved in patterning and development of a variety of organ systems, including the nervous system, the skeletal system, the craniofacial structures, and the gastrointestinal tract. Recent evidence also implicates this signaling pathway in the postembryonic regulation of stem-cell number in epithelia and blood. The family of HH proteins consists of at least three different members, i.e., sonic HH (SHH), Indian HH (IHH), and desert HH (DHH). SHH is the most broadly expressed member of this family and is probably responsible for the major effects of this signaling pathway. The HH signal is received and transduced via a specific receptor complex composed of patched (PTCH) and smoothened (SMOH) transmembrane proteins. Abnormalities in this signaling cascade have been found in various developmental pathologies and neoplasms such as basal cell carcinoma. The abnormalities are associated with congenital or sporadic genetic alteration affecting function of different components of the HH signaling pathway, including SHH, PTCH, SMOH and GLI proteins.",International journal of molecular medicine,2001
12213892,"Clinical, genetic, and functional characterization of adrenocorticotropin receptor mutations using a novel receptor assay.","The ACTH receptor (MC2R) is expressed predominantly in the adrenal cortex, but is one of five G protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane melanocortin receptors (MCRs), all of which bind ACTH to some degree. Testing of MC2R activity is difficult because most cells express endogenous MCRs; hence, ACTH will elicit background activation of assayable reporter systems. Inactivating mutations of MC2R lead to hereditary unresponsiveness to ACTH, also known as familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD). These patients are usually seen in early childhood with very low cortisol concentrations, normal mineralocorticoids, hyperpigmentation, and increased bodily growth. Several MC2R mutations have been reported in FGD, but assays of the activities of these mutants are cumbersome. We saw two patients with typical clinical findings of FGD. Genetic analysis showed that patient 1 was homozygous for the mutation R137W, and patient 2 was a compound heterozygote for S74I and Y254C. We tested the activity of these mutations in OS-3 cells, which are unresponsive to ACTH but have intact downstream cAMP signal transduction. OS-3 cells transfected with a cAMP-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid (pCREluc) were unresponsive to ACTH, but cotransfection with a vector expressing human MC2R increased luciferase activity more than 40-fold. Addition of ACTH to cells cotransfected with the pCREluc reporter and wild-type MC2R activated luciferase expression with a 50% effective concentration of 5.5 x 10(-9) M ACTH, which is similar to previously reported values. By contrast, the MC2R mutant R137W had low activity, and the S74I or Y254C mutants elicited no measurable response. This assay provides excellent sensitivity in an easily assayed transient transfection system, providing a more rapid and efficient measurement of ACTH receptor activity.",,
9722565,Cloned human and rat galanin GALR3 receptors. Pharmacology and activation of G-protein inwardly rectifying K+ channels.,"The neuropeptide galanin has been implicated in the regulation of processes such as nociception, cognition, feeding behavior, and hormone secretion. Multiple galanin receptors are predicted to mediate its effects, but only two functionally coupled receptors have been reported. We now report the cloning of a third galanin receptor distinct from GALR1 and GALR2. The receptor, termed GALR3, was isolated from a rat hypothalamus cDNA library by both expression and homology cloning approaches. The rat GALR3 receptor cDNA can encode a protein of 370 amino acids with 35% and 52% identity to GALR1 and GALR2, respectively. Localization of mRNA by solution hybridization/RNase protection demonstrates that the GALR3 transcript is widely distributed, but expressed at low abundance, with the highest levels in the hypothalamus and pituitary. We also isolated the gene encoding the human homologue of GALR3. The human GALR3 receptor is 90% identical to rat GALR3 and contains 368 amino acids. Binding of porcine 125I-galanin to stably expressed rat and human GALR3 receptors is saturable (rat KD = 0.98 nM and human KD = 2.23 nM) and displaceable by galanin peptides and analogues in the following rank order: rat galanin, porcine galanin approximately M32, M35 approximately porcine galanin-(-7 to +29), galantide, human galanin > M40, galanin-(1-16) > [D-Trp2]galanin-(1-29), galanin-(3-29). This profile resembles that of the rat GALR1 and GALR2 receptors with the notable exception that human galanin, galanin-(1-16), and M40 show lower affinity at GALR3. In Xenopus oocytes, activation of rat and human GALR3 receptors co-expressed with potassium channel subunits GIRK1 and GIRK4 resulted in inward K+ currents characteristic of Gi/Go-coupled receptors. These data confirm the functional efficacy of GALR3 receptors and further suggest that GALR3 signaling pathways resemble those of GALR1 in that both can activate potassium channels linked to the regulation of neurotransmitter release.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998

In transfected COS-1 cells, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and less efficiently BMP-4, bound to BMPR-II. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of OP-1/BMP-7 to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-II in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by OP-1/BMP-7.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1995

The genes of GalRL were localized to chromosome 5q32 in human and to 18B3 in mouse. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of GalRL in the central nervous system of human and mouse and in 7- and 15-day-old mouse embryos. Minor levels were found in some peripheral organs and tissues, such as testis, liver, kidney and stomach. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated predominant expression of GalRL in the central nervous system, with a distinct localization in the habenular complex. In the peripheral nervous system single neurons of sensory ganglia were labeled. During embryonal development the expression was more widespread in the nervous system, where in addition to the dorsal thalamus, hybridization signals were detected in other areas of the brain including the striatum, the locus coeruleus, and several hindbrain nuclei. A weak activation of GalRL by galanin suggests that the endogenous ligand shares structural features with galanin.",,
9405404,Cloning and characterization of a novel promiscuous human beta-chemokine receptor D6.,"Members of the chemokine family of chemotactic peptides interact with their target cells through heptahelical cell surface receptors. An understanding of the biochemistry and expression patterns of these receptors is therefore central to our overall understanding of the roles played by chemokines in both physiological and pathological processes. To date, eight receptors for the beta-chemokine subfamily have been described. We have recently cloned a novel murine beta-chemokine receptor and report here the identification and characterization of a highly homologous human gene termed human D6 (hD6). This is a promiscuous beta-chemokine receptor and appears to be able to bind the majority of members of the beta-chemokine family. It is, however, specific for this family and shows no detectable affinity for members of the alpha-chemokine or the C or CXXXC chemokines. Unlike the majority of other chemokine receptors, human D6 does not appear to be able to flux calcium following ligand binding, thus it is currently not clear if this novel receptor is indeed a signaling receptor. Human D6 is expressed in a range of tissues including hemopoietic cells although it appears not to be ubiquitously expressed in hemopoietic cells. Human D6, unlike some other beta-chemokine receptors, appears not to be able to function as an entry co-factor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-)1 on CD4-expressing cells.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
9294137,Cloning and characterization of a specific receptor for the novel CC chemokine MIP-3alpha from lung dendritic cells.,"Dendritic cells are potent antigen-presenting cells involved in the initiation of immune responses. The trafficking of these cells to tissues and lymph nodes is mediated by members of the chemokine family. Recently, a novel CC chemokine known as MIP-3alpha or liver and activation-regulated chemokine has been identified from the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ expressed sequence tag database. In the present study, we have shown that the messenger RNA for MIP-3alpha is expressed predominantly in inflamed and mucosal tissues. MIP-3alpha produced either synthetically or by human embryonic kidney 293 cells is chemotactic for CD34(+)-derived dendritic cells and T cells, but is inactive on monocytes and neutrophils. MIP-3alpha was unable to displace the binding of specific CC or CXC chemokines to stable cell lines expressing their respective high affinity receptors, namely CCR1-5 and CXCR1 and CXCR2, suggesting that MIP-3alpha acts through a novel CC chemokine receptor. Therefore, we used degenerate oligonucleotide-based reverse transcriptase PCR to identify candidate MIP-3alpha receptors in lung dendritic cells. Our results show that the orphan receptor known as GCY-4, CKRL-3, or STRL-22 is a specific receptor for MIP-3alpha, and that its activation leads to pertussis toxin-sensitive and phospholipase C-dependent intracellular Ca2+ mobilization when it is expressed in HEK 293 cells.",,
8612563,Cloning and characterization of human urocortin.,"Urocortin, a new member of the CRF peptide family which also includes urotensin I and sauvagine, was recently cloned from the rat midbrain. The synthetic replicate of urocortin was found to bind with high affinity to type 1 and type 2 CRF receptors and, based upon its anatomic localization within the brain, was proposed to be a natural ligand for the type 2 CRF receptors. Using a genomic library, we have cloned the human counterpart of rat urocortin and localized it to human chromosome 2. Human and rat urocortin share 95% identity within the mature peptide region. Synthetic human urocortin binds with high affinity to CRF receptor types 1, 2 alpha, and 2 beta, stimulates cAMP accumulation from cells stably transfected with these receptors, and acts in vitro to release ACTH from dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells. In addition, the CRF-binding protein binds human urocortin with high affinity and can prevent urocortin-stimulated ACTH secretion in vitro. The inhibitory effect of the CRF-binding protein on human urocortin can be blocked by biologically inactive CRF fragments, such as CRF(9-33).",Endocrinology,1996

The human IL-1HY2 protein shares significant amino acid sequence similarity (37%) with the IL-1 receptor antagonist and has a predicted three-dimensional structure similar to that of the IL-1 receptor antagonist. The IL-1HY2 gene is located in close proximity to other IL-1 family genes on human chromosome 2, and the genomic organization of the IL-1HY2 gene is highly conserved with other IL-1 family members. IL-1HY2 protein is secreted from mammalian cells, and the purified recombinant IL-1HY2 protein binds soluble IL-1 receptor type I. IL-1HY2 is expressed in human skin, spleen, and tonsil. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the IL-1HY2 protein is expressed in the basal epithelia of skin and in proliferating B cells of the tonsil.

For the CRF2 receptor subtype, at least 2 splice forms with different 5'-coding sequences (CRF2 alpha and CRF2 beta) have been identified in rat. In this article, we report the genomic structure and the corresponding complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence of the human CRF2 receptor. The gene coding for human CRF2 receptor consists of at least 12 exons and spans approximately 30 kilobases. The cDNA sequence in the protein-coding region is 94% identical to that of the reported rat CRF2 alpha receptor. At present, there is no evidence for the existence of a CRF2 beta receptor homolog in humans. The encoded receptor is 411 amino acids in length and is 70% identical to the human CRF1 receptor, with least sequence homology in the N-terminal extracellular domain (47% identical). Cells transfected with the full-length human CRF2 receptor cDNA responded to rat/human CRF and sauvagine by increasing the intracellular cAMP level, with EC50 values of approximately 20 and 1 nM, respectively. The CRF- and sauvagine-induced accumulation of intracellular cAMP could be competitively inhibited by the CRF receptor antagonist D-Phe-CRF.

The 388-amino acid protein, with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 42 kDa, displays sequence similarity, particularly within putative transmembrane domains, with the recently cloned hSSTR1 (69%), hSSTR2 (56%), and hSSTR3 (58%). Membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transiently expressing the hSSTR4 gene bound 125I-[Leu8,D-Trp22,Tyr25]SST-28 in a saturable manner with high affinity (approximately 60 pM) and with a pharmacological profile and rank order of potency ([D-Trp8]SST-14 > SST-14 > SMS 201-995 > SST-28 > MK-678) indicative of a SST-14-selective receptor. Ki values for the inhibition of 125I-[Leu8,D-Trp22,Tyr25]SST-28 binding to the expressed receptor by these somatostatinergic peptides were 0.3, 1.1, 1.4, 2.2, and 6.5 nM, respectively. High affinity agonist binding to hSSTR4 was significantly reduced by GTP and pertussis toxin, indicating association of the expressed receptor with pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins.

Stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing SSTR1 or SSTR2 exhibit specific somatostatin binding, with an apparently higher affinity for somatostatin-14 than somatostatin-28, and NH2-terminally extended form of somatostatin-14. RNA blotting studies show that SSTR1 and SSTR2 are expressed at highest levels in jejunum and stomach and in cerebrum and kidney, respectively. A SSTR1 probe hybridized to multiple DNA fragments in EcoRI digests of human and mouse DNA, indicating that SSTR1 and SSTR2 are members of a larger family of somatostatin receptors. Thus, the biological effects of somatostatin are mediated by a family of receptors that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1992
8146174,Cloning and functional characterization of a third pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor subtype expressed in insulin-secreting cells.,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide belonging to the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/glucagon/secretin family. It is widely distributed in the body, and a variety of biological actions have been reported. PACAP exerts its biological effects by binding to specific receptors that are coupled to GTP-binding proteins. Recent studies have shown that there is a family of PACAP receptors (PACAPRs), and two members of this family have been identified. We report here the cloning, functional expression, and tissue distribution of a third PACAPR subtype, designated PACAPR-3. The cDNA encoding PACAPR-3 has been isolated from a mouse insulin-secreting beta-cell line MIN6 cDNA library. Mouse PACAPR-3 is a protein of 437 amino acids that has 50% and 51% identity with rat PACAP type I and type II receptors, respectively. Expression of recombinant mouse PACAPR-3 in mammalian cells shows that it binds to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide as well as PACAP-38 and -27, with a slightly higher affinity for PACAP-38, and is positively coupled to adenylate cyclase. The expression of PACAPR-3 in Xenopus oocytes indicates that calcium-activated chloride currents are evoked by PACAP and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, suggesting that PACAPR-3 can also be coupled to phospholipase C. RNA blot analysis studies reveal that PACAPR-3 mRNA is expressed at high levels in MIN6, at moderate levels in pancreatic islets and other insulin-secreting cell lines, HIT-T15 and RINm5F, as well as in the lung, brain, stomach, and colon, and at low levels in the heart. Furthermore, insulin secretion from MIN6 cells is significantly stimulated by PACAP-38. These results suggest that the diverse biological effects of PACAP are mediated by a family of structurally related proteins and that PACAPR-3 participates in the regulation of insulin secretion.",,
7559383,Cloning and functional expression of a cDNA encoding a human type 2 neuropeptide Y receptor.,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36-amino acid polypeptide that is widely distributed in the central nervous system and periphery. Pharmacological studies have suggested that there are at least three receptor subtypes, Y1, Y2, and Y3. Cloning of the Y1 subtype has been reported previously. Here we report the isolation by expression cloning of a cDNA encoding a human NPY receptor displaying a pharmacology typical of a Y2 receptor. COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA express high affinity binding sites for NPY, peptide YY, and NPY13-36, whereas [Leu31,Pro34]NPY binds with lower affinity. The receptor is 381 amino acids in length and has seven putative transmembrane regions typical of G-protein-coupled receptors. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of this Y2 receptor to that of the human Y1 receptor indicates that the two receptors are 31% identical at the amino acid level. Northern blot analyses reveal a single 4-kilobase mRNA species and indicate that the messenger RNA is present in many areas of the central nervous system. NPY induced calcium mobilization and inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells that stably express the Y2 receptor cDNA, indicating that the recombinant Y2 receptor is functionally coupled to second messenger systems.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1995
7622448,Cloning and functional expression of a human eosinophil CC chemokine receptor.,"Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, MIP-1 alpha and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1995
8390245,Cloning and functional expression of a human neuroendocrine vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor.,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a potent mediator of gastrointestinal, nervous, pulmonary, vascular and immune functions. A cDNA was obtained from human HT29 intestinal epithelial cells and found to encode a 457 amino acid, 52 kDa VIP receptor. Transfection of the cDNA into COS-7 cells and 293 cells resulted in expression of specific saturable binding of VIP with a Kd of 0.8 nM, and induction of increases in intracellular cAMP by VIP with an EC50 of 1 nM. The human VIP receptor is homologous to other G protein-coupled receptors of the secretin-parathyroid hormone receptor family. A 2.8 kb transcript was detected in human lung, HT29 cells and Raji B-lymphoblasts with weaker expression in human brain, heart, kidney, liver and placenta.",,
7592911,"Cloning and functional expression of a human Y4 subtype receptor for pancreatic polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, and peptide YY.","The pancreatic polypeptide family includes pancreatic polypeptide (PP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and peptide YY (PYY). Members of the PP family regulate numerous physiological processes, including appetite, gastrointestinal transit, anxiety, and blood pressure. Of the multiple Y-type receptors proposed for PP family members, only the Y1 subtype has been cloned previously. We now report the cloning of an additional Y-type receptor, designated Y4, by homology screening of a human placental genomic library with transmembrane (TM) probes derived from the rat Y1 gene. The Y4 genomic clone encodes a predicted protein of 375 amino acids that is most homologous to Y1 receptors from human, rat, and mouse (42% overall; 55% in TM). 125I-PYY binding to transiently expressed Y4 receptors was saturable (pKd = 9.89) and displaceable by human PP family derivatives: PP (pKi = 10.25) approximately PP2-36 (pKi = 10.06) > PYY (pKi = 9.06) approximately [Leu31,Pro34]NPY (pKi = 8.95) > NPY (pKi = 8.68) > PP13-36 (pKi = 7.13) > PP31-36 (pKi = 6.46) > PP31-36 free acid (pKi < 5). Human PP decreased [cAMP] and increased intracellular [Ca2+] in Y4-transfected LMTK- cells. Y4 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in human brain, coronary artery, and ileum, suggesting potential roles for Y4 receptors in central nervous system, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal function.",,
8243338,Cloning and functional expression of a rat brain corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptor.,"Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a key neuroregulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal cortical axis, also displays a broad range of effects on the endocrine, central nervous and immune systems. Having recently characterized the human pituitary CRF receptor by expression cloning of cDNA from a human Cushing's corticotropic adenoma, we report here the structure of the cDNA for a rat brain CRF receptor (rCRF-R) which was cloned by hybridization from a rat brain cDNA library. The sequence of the rCRF-R encodes a 415 amino acid protein comprising seven membrane spanning domains. The rCRF-R is 97% identical at the amino acid level to the human pituitary tumor CRF receptor, differing by only 12 amino acids. When expressed in COSM6 cells, the rCRF-R binds CRF with high affinity (Kd = 1.7 (0.8-3.8)nM). The receptor transduces a CRF stimulated accumulation of intracellular cAMP which is inhibited by the CRF antagonist, alpha helCRF(9-41). These results suggest that the brain expresses a CRF receptor similar to that in the pituitary.",,
8643460,Cloning and functional expression of cDNAs encoding human and rat pancreatic polypeptide receptors.,"PCR was used to isolate nucleotide sequences that may encode novel members of the neuropeptide Y receptor family. By use of a PCR product as a hybridization probe, a full-length human cDNA was isolated that encodes a 375-aa protein with a predicted membrane topology identifying it as a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. After stable transfection of the cDNA into human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the receptor exhibited high affinity (Kd = 2.8 nM) for 125I-labeled human pancreatic polypeptide (PP). Competition binding studies in whole cells indicated the following rank order of potency: human PP = bovine PP > or = human [Pro34]peptide YY > rat PP > human peptide YY = human neuropeptide Y. Northern blot analysis revealed that human PP receptor mRNA is most abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and, to a lesser extent, in lung and brain tissue. A rat cDNA clone encoding a high-affinity PP receptor that is 74% identical to the human PP receptor at the amino acid level was also isolated. These receptor clones will be useful in elucidating the functional role of PP and designing selective PP receptor agonists and antagonists.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1996
8404634,Cloning and functional expression of the human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor.,"Truncated forms of glucagon-like peptide-1 are the most potent endogenous stimuli of insulin secretion and have powerful antidiabetogenic effects. To determine the structure and coupling mechanisms of the human GLP-1 receptor we have isolated two pancreatic islet cDNAs, encoding the 463 amino acid receptor and differing mainly in their 3' untranslated regions. The deduced amino acid sequence is 90% homologous with the rat GLP-1 receptor. Northern blot analysis shows expression of a single 2.7 kb transcript in pancreatic tissue. When expressed in COS-7 cells the recombinant receptor conferred specific, high affinity GLP-1(7-37) binding. GLP-1(7-37) increased intracellular cAMP in a concentration dependent manner and caused an increase in the free cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) from an intracellular pool, characteristic of phospholipase C (PLC) activation. Thus, like the structurally related glucagon and parathyroid hormone receptors, the human GLP-1 receptor can activate multiple intracellular signaling pathways including adenylyl cyclase and PLC. Knowledge of the GLP-1 receptor structure will facilitate the development of receptor agonists and elucidation of the important role of GLP-1 in normal physiology and disease states.",,
2175397,Cloning of a cDNA encoding a non-isopeptide-selective subtype of the endothelin receptor.,"Endothelin-1 was initially identified as a 21-residue potent vasoconstrictor peptide produced by vascular endothelial cells, but was subsequently found to have many effects on both vascular and non-vascular tissues. The discovery of three isopeptides of the endothelin family, ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3, each possessing a diverse set of pharmacological activities of different potency, suggested the existence of several different endothelin receptor subtypes. Endothelins may elicit biological responses by various signal-transduction mechanisms, including the G protein-coupled activation of phospholipase C and the activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Thus, different subtypes of the endothelin receptor may use different signal-transduction mechanisms. Here we report the cloning of a complementary DNA encoding one subtype belonging to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA express specific and high-affinity binding sites for endothelins, responding to binding by the production of inositol phosphates and a transient increase in the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+. The three endothelin isopeptides are roughly equipotent in displacing 125I-labelled ET-1 binding and causing Ca2+ mobilization. A messenger RNA corresponding to the cDNA is detected in many rat tissues including the brain, kidney and lung but not in vascular smooth muscle cells. These results indicate that this cDNA encodes a 'nonselective' subtype of the receptor which is different from the vascular smooth muscle receptor.",Nature,1990
7869844,Cloning of a human kappa opioid receptor from the brain.,"By using a rat kappa opioid receptor cDNA as a probe to screen a human brain cDNA library, we isolated a 4.0-kb clone (z115) which encompasses a major portion of a human kappa opioid receptor (hkor), extending from the amino acid residue #6 to the 3'-untranslated region. The extreme 5'-region 232-bp fragment of z115 was used as a probe to screen a human genomic DNA library. A 1.6-kb fragment (d2) of one positive clone was found to extend from 5'-untranslated region to beyond the exon/intron junction at residue Arg86. The genomic DNA fragment d2 and the cDNA clone z115 were assembled to generate a clone (d2-z115) containing the entire coding sequence of hkor. Clone d2-z115 has an open reading frame of 1140 bp, which encodes for a 380-amino acid protein. The deduced amino acid sequence has 93.9% and 93.2% identity to rat and mouse kappa receptors, respectively. It also displays approximately 60% identity to both human mu and delta receptors. Northern blot analysis showed that in the human brain there was a single hkor mRNA transcript of 6.0 kb. Among brain regions examined, the amygdala, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus and subthalamic nucleus contained high levels of hkor mRNA. Hkor was cloned into the expression vector pBK-CMV and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. Hkor had high affinity for [3H] diprenorphine, a nonselective opioid antagonist, and displayed stereospecific binding to naloxone. kappa selective ligands (U50,488H and nor-BNI) had high affinities, whereas mu and delta selective ligands bound with much lower affinities. Dynorphin A (1-17) and alpha-neoendorphin, both endogenous kappa peptides, bound with high affinities. These binding characteristics confirmed that hkor is a kappa receptor, most likely kappa 1 type. Cloning of the human kappa receptor allows investigation of interactions of compounds with the human receptor, instead of rodent receptors, for development of better therapeutic agents.",,
7493937,Cloning of a human receptor of the NPY receptor family with high affinity for pancreatic polypeptide and peptide YY.,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptide YY (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) are structurally related peptides found in all higher vertebrates. NPY is expressed exclusively in neurons, whereas PYY and PP are produced primarily in gut endocrine cells. Several receptor subtypes have been identified pharmacologically, but only the NPY/PYY receptor of subtype Y1 has been cloned. This is a heptahelix receptor that couples to G proteins. We utilized Y1 sequence information from several species to clone a novel human receptor with 43% amino acid sequence identity to human Y1 and 53% identity in the transmembrane regions. The novel receptor displays a pharmacological profile that distinguishes it from all previously described NPY family receptors. It binds PP with an affinity (Ki) of 13.8 pM, PYY with 1.44 nM, and NPY with 9.9 nM. Because these data may identify the receptor as primarily a PP receptor, we have named it PP1. In stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells the PP1 receptor inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Northern hybridization detected mRNA in colon, small intestine, pancreas, and prostate. As all three peptides are present in the gut through either endocrine release or innervation, all three peptides may be physiological ligands to the novel NPY family receptor PP1.",,
9792649,"Cloning of a novel receptor subunit, AcPL, required for interleukin-18 signaling.","We have identified a novel member of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor family, which we have termed AcPL. In transient transfection assays, we were unable to demonstrate a role for AcPL in IL-1-induced activation of NFkappaB. Interleukin-18 (interferon-gamma-inducing factor) is another member of the IL-1 family of cytokines, and it has recently been shown that IL-18 has a weak affinity for IL-1R-rp1. We examined whether AcPL might function alone or in concert with IL-1R-rp1 to mediate IL-18 signaling. We found that both IL-1R-rp1 and AcPL expression were required for induction of NFkappaB activity and for activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in response to IL-18. Furthermore, a dominant negative version of AcPL specifically inhibited IL-18 signaling. In vitro immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that AcPL alone was unable to bind IL-18 with any appreciable affinity. We propose that although IL-1R-rp1 binds the cytokine, IL-1R-rp1 and AcPL proteins are both required for IL-18 signaling, analogous to the requirement for both IL-1R and IL-1RAcP in IL-1-mediated responses.",,
12802337,Cloning of adiponectin receptors that mediate antidiabetic metabolic effects.,"Adiponectin (also known as 30-kDa adipocyte complement-related protein; Acrp30) is a hormone secreted by adipocytes that acts as an antidiabetic and anti-atherogenic adipokine. Levels of adiponectin in the blood are decreased under conditions of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Administration of adiponectin causes glucose-lowering effects and ameliorates insulin resistance in mice. Conversely, adiponectin-deficient mice exhibit insulin resistance and diabetes. This insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin seems to be mediated by an increase in fatty-acid oxidation through activation of AMP kinase and PPAR-alpha. Here we report the cloning of complementary DNAs encoding adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) by expression cloning. AdipoR1 is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas AdipoR2 is predominantly expressed in the liver. These two adiponectin receptors are predicted to contain seven transmembrane domains, but to be structurally and functionally distinct from G-protein-coupled receptors. Expression of AdipoR1/R2 or suppression of AdipoR1/R2 expression by small-interfering RNA supports our conclusion that they serve as receptors for globular and full-length adiponectin, and that they mediate increased AMP kinase and PPAR-alpha ligand activities, as well as fatty-acid oxidation and glucose uptake by adiponectin.",Nature,2003
11590146,Cloning of human junctional adhesion molecule 3 (JAM3) and its identification as the JAM2 counter-receptor.,"We have identified a third member of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family. At the protein level JAM3 displays 36 and 32% identity to JAM2 and JAM1, respectively. The coding region is distributed over 9 exons and maps to chromosome 11q25. The gene shows widespread tissue expression with higher levels apparent in the kidney, brain, and placenta. At the cellular level we show expression of JAM3 transcript within endothelial cells. Our major finding is that JAM3 and JAM2 are binding partners. Thus, JAM3 ectodomain binds firmly to JAM2-Fc. This heterotypic interaction is maintained when JAM3-Fc is used to capture Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing full-length JAM2. In static adhesion assays we show that JAM3 is unable to bind to leukocyte cell lines. This is consistent with the lack of JAM2 expression. However, using JAM2-Fc pull-down experiments in combination with polyclonal anti-JAM3 serum, we demonstrate that JAM3 is the previously uncharacterized 43-kDa counter-receptor that mediates JAM2 adhesion to T cells. Most significantly we demonstrate up-regulation of JAM3 protein on peripheral blood lymphocytes following activation. Finally we show the utility of JAM3 ectodomain as an inhibitor of JAM2 adhesion.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
8609214,"Cloning of the human eosinophil chemoattractant, eotaxin. Expression, receptor binding, and functional properties suggest a mechanism for the selective recruitment of eosinophils.","The CC chemokine eotaxin, identified in guinea pigs and also recently in mice, may be a key element for the selective recruitment of eosinophils to certain inflamed tissues. Using a partial mouse eotaxin CDNA probe, the human eotaxin gene was cloned and found to be 61.8 and 63.2% identical at the amino acid level to guinea pig and mouse eotaxin. Human eotaxin protein was a strong and specific eosinophil chemoattractant in vitro and was an effective eosinophil chemoattractant when injected into the skin of a rhesus monkey. Radiolabeled eotaxin was used to identify a high affinity receptor on eosinophils (0.52 nM Kd), expressed at 4.8 x 10(4) sites per cell. This receptor also bound RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 with lower affinity, but not macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha. Eotaxin could desensitize calcium responses of eosinophils to RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein-3, although RANTES was able to only partially desensitize eosinophil calcium responses to eotaxin. Immunohistochemistry on human nasal polyp with antieotaxin mAbs showed that certain leukocytes as well as respiratory epithelium were intensely immunoreactive, and eosinophil infiltration occurred at sites of eotaxin upregulation. Thus eotaxin in humans is a potent and selective eosinophil chemoattractant that is expressed by a variety cell types in certain inflammatory conditions.",The Journal of clinical investigation,1996
10961879,"Cloning, characterization, and functional studies of human and mouse glycoprotein VI: a platelet-specific collagen receptor from the immunoglobulin superfamily.","Injuries to the vessel wall and subsequent exposure of collagen from the subendothelial matrix result in thrombus formation. In physiological conditions, the platelet plug limits blood loss. However, in pathologic conditions, such as rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, platelet-collagen interactions are associated with cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases. Platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) plays a crucial role in collagen-induced activation and aggregation of platelets, and people who are deficient in GPVI suffer from bleeding disorders. Based on the fact that GPVI is coupled to the Fc receptor (FcR)-gamma chain and thus should share homology with the FcR chains, the genes encoding human and mouse GPVI were identified. They belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and share 64% homology at the protein level. Functional evidence demonstrating the identity of the recombinant protein with GPVI was shown by binding to its natural ligand collagen; binding to convulxin (Cvx), a GPVI-specific ligand from snake venom; binding of anti-GPVI IgG isolated from a patient; and association to the FcR-gamma chain. The study also demonstrated that the soluble protein blocks Cvx and collagen-induced platelet aggregation and that GPVI expression is restricted to megakaryocytes and platelets. Finally, human GPVI was mapped to chromosome 19, long arm, region 1, band 3 (19q13), in the same region as multiple members of the Ig superfamily. This work offers the opportunity to explore the involvement of GPVI in thrombotic disease, to develop alternative antithrombotic compounds, and to characterize the mechanism involved in GPVI genetic deficiencies.

7997230,"Cloning, expression, and alternative splicing of the receptor for anti-Müllerian hormone.","Anti-Müllerian hormone, also called Müllerian-inhibiting substance or factor, is a glycoprotein dimer belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily and synthesized by immature Sertoli cells and postnatal granulosa cells. Anti-Müllerian hormone plays a key role in sex differentiation by inducing the regression of Müllerian ducts in the male fetus. It is also responsible for the stunting and masculinization of fetal ovaries in bovine freemartin fetuses and may be involved in the control of follicular maturation in the postnatal ovary. Using a degenerate probe for a consensus region of the transforming growth factor-beta receptor superfamily to screen a complementary DNA library from rabbit fetal ovaries, we cloned a complementary DNA coding for a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase, which is expressed around the fetal Müllerian duct, in fetal and adult granulosa cells, and in immature Sertoli cells. Two transcripts, generated by alternative splicing of an exon coding for an N-terminal 61-amino acid domain, are strongly expressed in anti-Müllerian hormone target organs and Sertoli cells. The longer, 569-amino acid, isoform binds anti-Müllerian hormone when transiently expressed in COS cells and is believed to encode its functional receptor.",,
8642344,"Cloning, expression, and characterization of the human eosinophil eotaxin receptor.","Although there is a mounting body of evidence that eosinophils are recruited to sites of allergic inflammation by a number of beta-chemokines, particularly eotaxin and RANTES, the receptor that mediates these actions has not been identified. We have now cloned a G protein-coupled receptor, CC CKR3, from human eosinophils which, when stably expressed in AML14.3D10 cells bound eotaxin, MCP-3 and RANTES with Kds of 0.1, 2.7 and 3.1 nM, respectively. CC CKR3 also bound MCP-1 with lower affinity, but did not bind MIP-1 alpha or MIP-1 beta. Eotaxin, RANTES, and to a lessor extent MCP-3, but not the other chemokines, activated CC CKR3 as determined by their ability to stimulate a Ca(2+) -flux. Competition binding studies on primary eosinophils gave binding affinities for the different chemokines which were indistinguishable from those measured with CC CKR3. Since CC CKR3 is prominently expressed in eosinophils we conclude that CC CKR3 is the eosinophil eotaxin receptor. Eosinophils also express a much lower level of a second chemokine receptor, CC CKR1, which appears to be responsible for the effects of MIP-1 alpha.",,

We report the cloning, chromosomal localization, expression, and ligand binding of a novel CC chemokine receptor, CCR10. CCR10 is expressed primarily in placenta and fetal liver, and binds two of the CC chemokines, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and MCP-3, with highest affinity. The KD for MCP-3 binding was 1 nM, and MCP-1 competed for MCP-3 binding with an IC50 of 1.2 nM. The CC chemokines MCP-4 and RANTES competed for MCP-3 binding with IC50 values of 7.5 and 5.4 nM, respectively. The chromosomal location of CCR10 was determined to coincide with the CC chemokine receptor cluster on chromosome 3 (3p21.31-3p21.32). These results indicate that CCR10 is a novel CC chemokine receptor with a unique expression pattern that would be consistent with a role in placental immunity or hematopoiesis.",DNA and cell biology,1997
9195948,"Cloning, in vitro expression, and functional characterization of a novel human CC chemokine of the monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) family (MCP-4) that binds and signals through the CC chemokine receptor 2B.","Here we describe the characterization of a novel human CC chemokine, tentatively named monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-4). This chemokine was detected by random sequencing of expressed sequence tags in cDNA libraries. The full-length cDNA revealed an open reading frame for a 98-amino acid residue protein, and a sequence alignment with known CC chemokines showed high levels of similarity (59-62%) with MCP-1, MCP-3, and eotaxin. MCP-4 cDNA was cloned into Drosophila S2 cells, and the mature protein (residues 24-98) was purified from the conditioned medium. Recombinant MCP-4 induced a potent chemotactic response (EC50 = 2.88 +/- 0.15 nM) and a transient rise in cytosolic calcium concentration in fresh human peripheral blood monocytes but not in neutrophils. Binding studies in monocytes showed that MCP-4 and MCP-3 were very potent in displacing high affinity binding of 125I-MCP-1 (IC50 for MCP-4, MCP-3, and unlabeled MCP-1 of 2.1 +/- 1.4, 0.85-1.6, and 0.7 +/- 0.2 nM respectively), suggesting that all three chemokines interact with the CC chemokine receptor-2 (MCP-1 receptor). This was confirmed in binding studies with Chinese hamster ovary cells, stably transfected with the CC chemokine 2B receptor. Northern blot analysis in extracts of normal human tissues showed expression of mRNA for MCP-4 in small intestine, thymus, and colon, but the level of protein expression was too low to be detected in Western blot analysis.

Administration of cortistatin into the brain ventricles specifically enhances slow-wave sleep, presumably by antagonizing the effects of acetylcholine on cortical excitability. Here we report the identification of cDNAs corresponding to mouse and human preprocortistatin and the mRNA distribution and gene mapping of mouse cortistatin. Analysis of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences from rat and mouse reveals that the 14 C-terminal residues of preprocortistatin, which make up the sequence that is most similar to somatostatin, are conserved between species. Lack of conservation of other dibasic amino acid residues whose cleavage by prohormone convertases would give rise to additional peptides suggests that cortistatin-14 is the only active peptide derived from the precursor. As in the rat, mouse preprocortistatin mRNA is present in GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The preprocortistatin gene maps to mouse chromosome 4, in a region showing conserved synteny with human 1p36.

8621645,"Co-purification and direct interaction of Ras with caveolin, an integral membrane protein of caveolae microdomains. Detergent-free purification of caveolae microdomains.","Caveolae are plasma membrane specializations that have been implicated in signal transduction. Caveolin, a 21-24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal structural component of caveolae membranes in vivo. G protein alpha subunits are concentrated in purified preparations of caveolae membranes, and caveolin interacts directly with multiple G protein alpha subunits, including G(s), G(o), and G(i2). Mutational or pharmacologic activation of G alpha subunits prevents the interaction of caveolin with G proteins, indicating that inactive G alpha subunits preferentially interact with caveolin. Here, we show that caveolin interacts with another well characterized signal transducer, Ras. Using a detergent-free procedure for purification of caveolin-rich membrane domains and a polyhistidine tagged form of caveolin, we find that Ras and other classes of lipid-modified signaling molecules co-fractionate and co-elute with caveolin. The association of Ras with caveolin was further evaluated using two distinct in vitro binding assays. Wild-type H-Ras interacted with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-caveolin fusion proteins but not with GST alone. Using a battery of GST fusion proteins encoding distinct regions of caveolin, Ras binding activity was localized to a 41-amino acid membrane proximal region of the cytosolic N-terminal domain of caveolin. In addition, reconstituted caveolin-rich membranes (prepared with purified recombinant caveolin and purified lipids) interacted with a soluble form of wild-type H-Ras but failed to interact with mutationally activated soluble H-Ras (G12V). Thus, a single amino acid change (G12V) that constitutively activates Ras prevents or destabilizes this interaction. These results clearly indicate that (i) caveolin is sufficient to recruit soluble Ras onto lipid membranes and (ii) membrane-bound caveolin preferentially interacts with inactive Ras proteins. In direct support of these in vitro studies, we also show that recombinant overexpression of caveolin in intact cells is sufficient to functionally recruit a nonfarnesylated mutant of Ras (C186S) onto membranes, overcoming the normal requirement for lipid modification of Ras. Taken together, these observations suggest that caveolin may function as a scaffolding protein to localize or sequester certain caveolin-interacting proteins, such as wild-type Ras, within caveolin-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane.",,
24517231,Coevolution of the spexin/galanin/kisspeptin family: Spexin activates galanin receptor type II and III.,"The novel neuropeptide spexin (SPX) was discovered using bioinformatics. The function of this peptide is currently under investigation. Here, we identified SPX along with a second SPX gene (SPX2) in vertebrate genomes. Syntenic analysis and relocating SPXs and their neighbor genes on reconstructed vertebrate ancestral chromosomes revealed that SPXs reside in the near vicinity of the kisspeptin (KISS) and galanin (GAL) family genes on the chromosomes. Alignment of mature peptide sequences showed some extent of sequence similarity among the 3 peptide groups. Gene structure analysis indicated that SPX is more closely related to GAL than KISS. These results suggest that the SPX, GAL, and KISS genes arose through local duplications before 2 rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplication. Receptors of KISS and GAL (GAL receptor [GALR]) are phylogenetically closest among rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors, and synteny revealed the presence of 3 distinct receptor families KISS receptor, GALR1, and GALR2/3 before 2R. A ligand-receptor interaction study showed that SPXs activate human, Xenopus, and zebrafish GALR2/3 family receptors but not GALR1, suggesting that SPXs are natural ligands for GALR2/3. Particularly, SPXs exhibited much higher potency toward GALR3 than GAL. Together, these results identify the coevolution of SPX/GAL/KISS ligand genes with their receptor genes. This study demonstrates the advantage of evolutionary genomics to explore the evolutionary relationship of a peptide gene family that arose before 2R by local duplications.",Endocrinology,2014
9487987,Coexistence of novel amylin-binding sites with calcitonin receptors in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells.,"Amylin, calcitonin (CT) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) share limited structural homology including amino-terminal ring structures linked by a disulfide bridge and amidated carboxy-termini. Here, we have compared [125I]Bolton-Hunter-[Lys1] rat amylin ([125I]amylin) binding and the stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation by human (h) amylin, hCT and hCGRP-I in the human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and T47D, which predominantly express hCT1a and hCT1b receptor isoforms (hCTR1a, hCTR1b) at a similar total number of hCT-binding sites. In MCF-7 cells, half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of [125I]amylin binding by human amylin was observed at 3.6 +/- 0.8 nM (n = 6). hCT and hCGRP-I displaced [125I]amylin binding with 22 and 66 times higher IC50. [125I]hCT binding was inhibited by hCT with an IC50 of 8.1 +/- 1.9 nM (n = 5), and human amylin and hCGRP-I were over 100 times less potent. In T47D cells, on the other hand, specific binding of [125I]amylin was not observed, but hCT inhibited [125I]hCT binding with an IC50 of 3.2 +/- 0.4 nM (n = 3), and human amylin and hCGRP-I had over 200 times higher IC50. In MCF-7 cells, half-maximal stimulation (EC50) of cyclic AMP accumulation by human amylin, hCT and hCGRP-I occurred at 1.4 +/- 0.2, 1.7 +/- 0.4 and 6.3 +/- 1.3 nM respectively. In T47D cells, the EC50 of hCT was 0.32 +/- 0.02 nM (n = 3), and 30- and 1900-fold higher with human amylin and hCGRP-I. In conclusion, the expression of hCTR1a and hCTR1b and [125I]hCT binding were indistinguishable in MCF-7 and T47D cells. Yet, [125I]amylin binding was only recognized in MCF-7 cells, consistent with a distinct amylin receptor.",,
7514177,Coexpression of erbB2 and erbB3 proteins reconstitutes a high affinity receptor for heregulin.,"The heregulin/neu differentiation factor gene products were purified and cloned based on their ability to stimulate the phosphorylation of a 185-kDa protein in human breast carcinoma cell lines known to express erbB2. However, not all cells that express erbB2 respond to heregulin, indicating that other components besides erbB2 may be required for heregulin binding. Cells that are transfected with the closely related receptor, erbB3, display a single class of lower affinity heregulin binding sites than has been previously observed on breast carcinoma cell lines. Little or no stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to heregulin occurs in cells that are transfected with erbB3 alone. Transfection of cells with erbB3 and erbB2 reconstitutes a higher affinity binding receptor, which is also capable of generating a tyrosine phosphorylation signal in response to heregulin. A monoclonal antibody to erbB2 will inhibit heregulin activation of tyrosine phosphorylation and binding in cells transfected with both receptors but not with erbB3 alone. In cells expressing erbB2 and erbB3, both proteins become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon interaction with heregulin. Direct interaction between heregulin and the two proteins was demonstrated by chemical cross-linking experiments using 125I-heregulin followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for erbB2 or erbB3.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1994
10514495,Collagenase-3 binds to a specific receptor and requires the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein for internalization.,"We have previously identified a specific receptor for collagenase-3 that mediates the binding, internalization, and degradation of this ligand in UMR 106-01 rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells. In the present study, we show that collagenase-3 binding is calcium-dependent and occurs in a variety of cell types, including osteoblastic and fibroblastic cells. We also present evidence supporting a two-step mechanism of collagenase-3 binding and internalization involving both a specific collagenase-3 receptor and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Ligand blot analysis shows that (125)I-collagenase-3 binds specifically to two proteins ( approximately 170 kDa and approximately 600 kDa) present in UMR 106-01 cells. Western blotting identified the 600-kDa protein as the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Our data suggest that the 170-kDa protein is a specific collagenase-3 receptor. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-null mouse embryo fibroblasts bind but fail to internalize collagenase-3, whereas UMR 106-01 and wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts bind and internalize collagenase-3. Internalization, but not binding, is inhibited by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein. We conclude that the internalization of collagenase-3 requires the participation of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and propose a model in which the cell surface interaction of this ligand requires a sequential contribution from two receptors, with the collagenase-3 receptor acting as a high affinity primary binding site and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein mediating internalization.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
16754721,"Collagens are functional, high affinity ligands for the inhibitory immune receptor LAIR-1.","Collagens are the most abundant proteins in the human body, important in maintenance of tissue structure and hemostasis. Here we report that collagens are high affinity ligands for the broadly expressed inhibitory leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1). The interaction is dependent on the conserved Gly-Pro-Hyp collagen repeats. Antibody cross-linking of LAIR-1 is known to inhibit immune cell function in vitro. We now show that collagens are functional ligands for LAIR-1 and directly inhibit immune cell activation in vitro. Thus far, all documented ligands for immune inhibitory receptors are membrane molecules, implying a regulatory role in cell-cell interaction. Our data reveal a novel mechanism of peripheral immune regulation by inhibitory immune receptors binding to extracellular matrix collagens.",The Journal of experimental medicine,2006
11432874,Colocalization and interaction of cyclooxygenase-2 with caveolin-1 in human fibroblasts.,"Results from our previous study suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) may be localized to caveolae-like structures (Liou, J.-Y., Shyue, S.-K., Tsai, M.-J., Chung, C.-L., Chu, K.-Y., and Wu, K. K. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15314-15320). In this study, we determined subcellular localization of COX-2 and caveolin-1 by confocal microscopy. COX-2 in human foreskin fibroblasts stimulated by PMA (100 nm) or interleukin-1beta (1 ng/ml) for 6 h was localized to plasma membrane in addition to endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Caveolin-1 was localized to plasma membrane, and image overlay showed colocalization of COX-2 with caveolin-1. This was confirmed by the presence of COX-2 and caveolin-1 in the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction of cells stimulated by PMA. Immunoprecipitation showed complex formation of COX-2 with caveolin-1 in a time-dependent manner. A larger quantity of COX-2 was complexed with caveolin-1 in PMA-treated than in interleukin-1beta-treated cells. Purified COX-2 complexed with glutathione S-transferase-fused caveolin-1, which was not inhibited by the scaffolding domain peptide. Caveolin-1-bound COX-2 was catalytically active, and its activity was not inhibited by the scaffolding domain peptide. These results suggest that COX-2 induced by PMA and interleukin-1beta is colocalized with caveolin-1 in the segregated caveolae compartment. Because caveolae are rich in signaling molecules, this COX-2 compartment may play an important role in diverse pathophysiological processes.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
15661745,Comparative agonist/antagonist responses in mutant human C5a receptors define the ligand binding site.,"The C terminus is responsible for all of the agonist activity of C5a at human C5a receptors (C5aRs). In this report we have mapped the ligand binding site on the C5aR using a series of agonist and antagonist peptide mimics of the C terminus of C5a as well as receptors mutated at putative interaction sites (Ile(116), Arg(175,) Arg(206), Glu(199), Asp(282), and Val(286)). Agonist peptide 1 (Phe-Lys-Pro-d-cyclohexylalanine-cyclohexylalanine-d-Arg) can be converted to an antagonist by substituting the bulkier Trp for cyclohexylalanine at position 5 (peptide 2). Conversely, mutation of C5aR transmembrane residue Ile(116) to the smaller Ala (I116A) makes the receptor respond to peptide 2 as an agonist (Gerber, B. O., Meng, E. C., Dotsch, V., Baranski, T. J., and Bourne, H. R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3394-3400). However, a potent cyclic hexapeptide antagonist, Phe-cyclo-[Orn-Pro-d-cyclohexylalanine-Trp-Arg] (peptide 3), derived from peptide 2 and which binds to the same receptor site, remains a full antagonist at I116AC5aR. This suggests that although the residue at position 5 might bind near to Ile(116), the latter is not essential for either activation or antagonism. Arg(206) and Arg(175) both appear to interact with the C-terminal carboxylate of C5a agonist peptides, suggesting a dynamic binding mechanism that may be a part of a receptor activation switch. Asp(282) has been previously shown to interact with the side chain of the C-terminal Arg residue, and Glu(199) may also interact with this side chain in both C5a and peptide mimics. Using these interactions to orient NMR-derived ligand structures in the binding site of C5aR, a new model of the interaction between peptide antagonists and the C5aR is presented.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2005
10454496,Comparative pharmacology of the nonpeptide neuromedin B receptor antagonist PD 168368.,"The mammalian peptide neuromedin B (NMB) and its receptor are expressed in a variety of tissues; however, little is definitively established about its physiological actions because of the lack of potent, specific antagonists. Recently, the peptoid PD 168368 was found to be a potent human NMB receptor antagonist. Because it had been shown previously that either synthetic analogs of bombesin (Bn) or other receptor peptoid or receptor antagonists function as an antagonist or agonist depends on animal species and receptor subtype studied, we investigated the pharmacological properties of PD 168368 compared with all currently known Bn receptor subtypes (NMB receptor, gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, Bn receptor subtype 3, and Bn receptor subtype 4) from human, mouse, rat, and frog. In binding studies, PD 168368 had similar high affinities (K(i) = 15-45 nM) for NMB receptors from each species examined, 30- to 60-fold lower affinity for gastrin-releasing peptide receptors, and >300-fold lower affinity for Bn receptor subtype 3 or 4. It inhibited NMB binding in a competitive manner. PD 168368 alone did not stimulate increases in either intracellular calcium concentration or [(3)H]inositol phosphates in any of the cells studied but inhibited NMB-induced responses with equivalent potencies in cells containing NMB receptors. PD 168368 was only minimally soluble in water. When hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin rather than dimethyl sulfoxide was used as the vehicle, both the affinity and the antagonist potency of PD 168368 were significantly greater. The results demonstrate that PD 168368 is a potent, competitive, and selective antagonist at NMB receptors, with a similar pharmacology across animal species. PD 168368 should prove useful for delineating the biological role of NMB and selectively blocking NMB signaling in bioassays and as a lead for the development of more selective nonpeptide antagonists for the NMB receptor.",,
12115612,Comparison of CD22 binding to native CD45 and synthetic oligosaccharide.,"The B cell surface molecule CD22 is a member of the Siglec family. Siglecs possess a conserved membrane-distal immunoglobulin domain that mediates binding to sialylated glycoproteins or glycolipids. Although the structural basis of sialic acid recognition by Siglecs is quite well understood, the binding properties of the interaction between Siglecs and their native ligands have not been investigated. CD22 binding requires alpha2-6-linked sialic acid, which is mostly carried on N-glycans. One protein that carries such N-glycans is CD45. In this study we used surface plasmon resonance to perform thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of CD22 binding to native CD45. CD22 bound with a low affinity (K(d) 130 microM at 25 degrees C) and very fast kinetics (k(off) >or=18 s(-1), calculated k(on) >or=1.5 x 10(5) M(-1)s(-1)). Van't Hoff analysis revealed that binding was enthalpically driven at physiological temperatures, as is typical of most lectin-carbohydrate interactions. Since there is evidence that CD22 binds preferably to CD45, even though many cell surface proteins carry alpha2-6-linked sialic acid, we compared the affinities of CD22 binding to CD45, to CD4 carrying alpha2-6-linked sialic acid, and to a synthetic alpha2-6-sialoglycoconjugate. The affinities did not differ substantially, suggesting that CD22 binds preferentially to CD45 not because the latter presents higher affinity ligands but because it carries multiple copies of thereof.",European journal of immunology,2002
10369464,"Comparison of the effects of [Phe1psi(CH2-NH)Gly2]nociceptin(1-13)NH2 in rat brain, rat vas deferens and CHO cells expressing recombinant human nociceptin receptors.","Nociceptin(NC) is the endogenous ligand for the opioid receptor like-1 receptor (NC-receptor). [Phe1(psi)(CH2-NH)Gly2]Nociceptin(1-13)NH2 ([F/G]NC(1-13)NH2) has been reported to antagonize NC actions in peripheral guinea-pig and mouse tissues. In this study, we investigated the effects of a range of NC C-terminal truncated fragments and [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 on NC receptor binding, glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical slices (rCX), inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in CHO cells expressing the NC receptor (CHO(NCR)) and electrically evoked contractions of the rat vas deferens (rVD). In radioligand binding assays, a range of ligands inhibited [125I]-Tyr14-NC binding in membranes from rCX and CHO(NCR) cells. As the peptide was truncated there was a general decline in pKi. [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 was as potent as NC(1-13)NH2. The order of potency for NC fragments to inhibit cyclic AMP accumulation in whole CHO(NCR) cells was NCNH2> or =NC=NC(1-13)NH2>NC(1-12)NH2> >NC(1-11)NH2. [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 was a full agonist with a pEC50 value of 8.65. NCNH2 and [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 both inhibited K+ evoked glutamate release from rCX with pEC50 and maximum inhibition of 8.16, 48.5+/-4.9% and 7.39, 58.9+/-6.8% respectively. In rVD NC inhibited electrically evoked contractions with a pEC50 of 6.63. Although [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2, displayed a small (instrinsic activity alpha = 0.19) but consistent residual agonist activity, it acted as a competitive antagonist (pA2 6.76) in the rVD. The differences between [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 action on central and peripheral NC signalling could be explained if [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 was a partial agonist with high strength of coupling in the CNS and low in the periphery. An alternative explanation could be the existence of central and peripheral receptor isoforms.",,
11027676,Comparison of the interactions of transferrin receptor and transferrin receptor 2 with transferrin and the hereditary hemochromatosis protein HFE.,"The transferrin receptor (TfR) interacts with two proteins important for iron metabolism, transferrin (Tf) and HFE, the protein mutated in hereditary hemochromatosis. A second receptor for Tf, TfR2, was recently identified and found to be functional for iron uptake in transfected cells (Kawabata, H., Germain, R. S., Vuong, P. T., Nakamaki, T., Said, J. W., and Koeffler, H. P. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 16618-16625). TfR2 has a pattern of expression and regulation that is distinct from TfR, and mutations in TfR2 have been recognized as the cause of a non-HFE linked form of hemochromatosis (Camaschella, C., Roetto, A., Cali, A., De Gobbi, M., Garozzo, G., Carella, M., Majorano, N., Totaro, A., and Gasparini, P. (2000) Nat. Genet. 25, 14-15). To investigate the relationship between TfR, TfR2, Tf, and HFE, we performed a series of binding experiments using soluble forms of these proteins. We find no detectable binding between TfR2 and HFE by co-immunoprecipitation or using a surface plasmon resonance-based assay. The affinity of TfR2 for iron-loaded Tf was determined to be 27 nm, 25-fold lower than the affinity of TfR for Tf. These results imply that HFE regulates Tf-mediated iron uptake only from the classical TfR and that TfR2 does not compete for HFE binding in cells expressing both forms of TfR.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
28480349,Complement factor P is a ligand for the natural killer cell-activating receptor NKp46.,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are involved in immune responses to microbes and various stressed cells, such as tumor cells. They include group 1 [such as natural killer (NK) cells and ILC1], group 2, and group 3 ILCs. Besides their capacity to respond to cytokines, ILCs detect their targets through a series of cell surface-activating receptors recognizing microbial and nonmicrobial ligands. The nature of some of these ligands remains unclear, limiting our understanding of ILC biology. We focused on NKp46, which is highly conserved in mammals and expressed by all mature NK cells and subsets of ILC1 and ILC3. We show here that NKp46 binds to a soluble plasma glycoprotein, the complement factor P (CFP; properdin), the only known positive regulator of the alternative complement pathway. Consistent with the selective predisposition of patients lacking CFP to lethal",,
14568956,Complement regulatory protein C1 inhibitor binds to selectins and interferes with endothelial-leukocyte adhesion.,"C1 inhibitor (C1INH), a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) family, is an inhibitor of proteases in the complement system, the contact system of kinin generation, and the intrinsic coagulation pathway. It is the most heavily glycosylated plasma protein, containing 13 definitively identified glycosylation sites as well as an additional 7 potential glycosylation sites. C1INH consists of two distinct domains: a serpin domain and an amino-terminal domain. The serpin domain retains all the protease-inhibitory function, while the amino-terminal domain bears most of the glycosylation sites. The present studies test the hypothesis that plasma C1INH bears sialyl Lewis(x)-related moieties and therefore binds to selectin adhesion molecules. We demonstrated that plasma C1INH does express sialyl Lewis(x)-related moieties on its N-glycan as detected using mAb HECA-452 and CSLEX1. The data also show that plasma C1INH can bind to P- and E-selectins by FACS and immunoprecipitation experiments. In a tissue culture model of endothelial-leukocyte adhesion, C1INH showed inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. Significant inhibition (>50%) was achieved at a concentration of 250 micro g/ml or higher. This discovery may suggest that C1INH plays a role in the endothelial-leukocyte interaction during inflammation. It may also provide another example of the multifaceted anti-inflammatory effects of C1INH in various animal models and human diseases.",,
12874224,Complexes of HLA-G protein on the cell surface are important for leukocyte Ig-like receptor-1 function.,"The nonclassical class I MHC molecule HLA-G is selectively expressed on extravillous cytotrophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface during pregnancy. HLA-G can inhibit the killing mediated by NK cells via interaction with the inhibitory NK cell receptor, leukocyte Ig-like receptor-1 (LIR-1). Comparison of the sequence of the HLA-G molecule to other class I MHC proteins revealed two unique cysteine residues located in positions 42 and 147. Mutating these cysteine residues resulted in a dramatic decrease in LIR-1 Ig binding. Accordingly, the mutated HLA-G transfectants were less effective in the inhibition of NK killing and RBL/LIR-1 induced serotonin release. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the involvement of the cysteine residues in the formation of HLA-G protein oligomers on the cell surface. The cysteine residue located at position 42 is shown to be critical for the expression of such complexes. These oligomers, unique among the class I MHC proteins, probably bind to LIR-1 with increased avidity, resulting in an enhanced inhibitory function of LIR-1 and an impaired killing function of NK cells.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2003
1502153,Complexes of tissue-type plasminogen activator and its serpin inhibitor plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1 are internalized by means of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor.,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator and urokinase are serine proteases secreted by many cell types that participate in biological processes, such as tissue restructuring, cell migration, and tumor metastasis. Clinically, these proteases are used to dissolve coronary fibrin clots that are the proximal causes of acute myocardial infarction. In vivo, the activity of these enzymes is controlled by plasminogen-activator inhibitors, members of the serpin family of protease inhibitors. This study shows that tissue-type plasminogen activator-inhibitor complexes bind in solution to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a large heterodimeric ubiquitous membrane receptor. In cultured cells, endocytosis and degradation of these complexes is reduced by polyclonal antibodies directed against LRP and inhibited by a M(r) 39,000 protein that binds to LRP and inhibits its interaction with previously known ligands, including apolipoprotein E and alpha 2-macroglobulin. We propose a role for LRP in the clearance of plasminogen activator-inhibitor complexes that is analogous to its function in the endocytosis of alpha 2-macroglobulin-protease complexes.",,
14656470,Components of the anti-Müllerian hormone signaling pathway in gonads.,"Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a member of the Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) family implicated in the regression of Müllerian ducts in male fetuses and in the development and function of gonads of both sexes. Members of the TGF-beta family signal through two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors called type I and type II, and two types of Smad proteins, receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad) and common Smad, Smad4. Components of the AMH signaling pathway have been identified in gonads and gonadal cell lines. The AMH type II receptor is highly specific. In contrast, the identity of the AMH type I receptor is not clear; three type I receptors of Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), Alk2, Alk3 and Alk6 may transduce AMH signals, but none of them has all the characteristics of an AMH type I receptor. AMH activates BMP-specific R-Smads and reporter genes.",,
10358030,Conformation of the core sequence in melanocortin peptides directs selectivity for the melanocortin MC3 and MC4 receptors.,"Melanocortin peptides regulate a variety of physiological processes. Five melanocortin receptors (MC-R) have been cloned and the MC3R and MC4R are the main brain MC receptors. The aim of this study was to identify structural requirements in both ligand and receptor that determine gamma-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) selectivity for the MC3R versus the MC4R. Substitution of Asp10 in [Nle4]Lys-gamma2-MSH for Gly10 from [Nle4]alpha-MSH, increased both activity and affinity for the MC4R while the MC3R remained unaffected. Analysis of chimeric MC3R/MC4Rs and mutant MC4Rs showed that Tyr268 of the MC4R mainly determined the low affinity for [Nle4]Lys-gamma2-MSH. The data demonstrate that Asp10 determines selectivity for the MC3R, however, not through direct side chain interactions, but probably by influencing how the melanocortin core sequence is presented to the receptor-binding pocket. This is supported by mutagenesis of Tyr268 to Ile in the MC4R which increased affinity and activity for [Nle4]Lys-gamma2-MSH, but decreased affinity for two peptides with constrained cyclic structure of the melanocortin core sequence, MT-II and [D-Tyr4]MT-II, that also displayed lower affinity for the MC3R. This study provides a general concept for peptide receptor selectivity, in which the major determinant for a selective receptor interaction is the conformational presentation of the core sequence in related peptides to the receptor-binding pocket.",,
15601748,Connective tissue growth factor CCN2 interacts with and activates the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA.,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is implicated as a factor promoting tissue fibrosis in several disorders, including diabetic nephropathy. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which it functions is not known. CTGF rapidly activates several intracellular signaling molecules in human mesangial cells (HMC), including extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2, Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, protein kinase B, CaMK II, protein kinase Calpha, and protein kinase Cdelta, suggesting that it functions via a signaling receptor. Treating HMC with CTGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins 75 to 80 and 140 to 180 kD within 10 min, and Western blot analysis of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates identified the neurotrophin receptor TrkA (molecular weight approximately 140 kD). Cross-linking rCTGF to cell surface proteins with 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) revealed that complexes formed with TrkA and with the general neurotrophin co-receptor p75(NTR). rCTGF stimulated phosphorylation of TrkA (tyr 490, 674/675). K252a, a known selective inhibitor of Trk, blocked this phosphorylation, CTGF-induced activation of signaling proteins, and CTGF-dependent induction of the transcription factor TGF-beta-inducible early gene in HMC. It is concluded that TrkA serves as a tyrosine kinase receptor for CTGF.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2005
18167060,Connective tissue growth factor with a novel fibronectin binding site promotes cell adhesion and migration during rat oval cell activation.,"Oval cell activation, as part of the regenerative process after liver injury, involves considerable cell-matrix interaction. The matricellular protein, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), has been shown to be critical for oval cell activation during liver regeneration following N-2-acetylaminofluorene/partial hepatectomy. To understand the mode of action of CTGF during this process, N-terminal CTGF was used as bait to screen a yeast two-hybrid complementary DNA library specific for regenerating livers with massive oval cell presence. Fibronectin (FN), a prominent component of hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM), was found to specifically bind to a new site on CTGF. In addition to module IV, this study showed that module I of CTGF was sufficient for binding to FN in both solid-phase in vitro binding assays and immunoprecipitation. Immunofluorescent staining revealed a dynamic ECM remodeling characterized by an FN-concentrated provisional matrix during oval cell-aided liver regeneration. Abundant CTGF protein was colocalized with FN in the provisional matrix. When expressed as recombinant proteins and immobilized on plastic surfaces, modules I and IV of CTGF were selectively adhesive to thymus cell antigen 1-positive (Thy1(+)) oval cells, stellate cells, and sinusoidal endothelial cells but not to hepatocytes. The adhesion of these two modules on Thy1(+) oval cells required heparan sulfate proteoglycan and integrin alpha(5)beta(1). Recombinant CTGF promoted an integrin alpha(5)beta(1)-dependent migration but not proliferation on Thy1(+) oval cells.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2008
15105373,Connective-tissue growth factor modulates WNT signalling and interacts with the WNT receptor complex.,"Connective-tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a member of the CCN family of secreted proteins. CCN family members contain four characteristic domains and exhibit multiple activities: they associate with the extracellular matrix, they can mediate cell adhesion, cell migration and chemotaxis, and they can modulate the activities of peptide growth factors. Many of the effects of CTGF are thought to be mediated by binding to integrins, whereas others may be because of its recently identified ability to interact with BMP4 and TGF beta. We demonstrate, using Xenopus embryos, that CTGF also regulates signalling through the Wnt pathway, in accord with its ability to bind to the Wnt co-receptor LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). This interaction is likely to occur through the C-terminal (CT) domain of CTGF, which is distinct from the BMP- and TGF beta-interacting domain. Our results define new activities of CTGF and add to the variety of routes through which cells regulate growth factor activity in development, disease and tissue homeostasis.",,
10866830,Conserved aromatic residues in the transmembrane region VI of the V1a vasopressin receptor differentiate agonist vs. antagonist ligand binding.,"Despite their opposite effects on signal transduction, the nonapeptide hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and its V1a receptor-selective cyclic peptide antagonist d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP display homologous primary structures, differing only at residues 1 and 2. These structural similarities led us to hypothesize that both ligands could interact with the same binding pocket in the V1a receptor. To determine receptor residues responsible for discriminating binding of agonist and antagonist ligands, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of conserved aromatic and hydrophilic residues as well as nonconserved residues, all located in the transmembrane binding pocket of the V1a receptor. Mutation of aromatic residues of transmembrane region VI (W304, F307, F308) reduced affinity for the d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP and markedly decreased affinity for the unrelated strongly hydrophobic V1a-selective nonpeptide antagonist SR 49059. Replacement of these aromatic residues had no effect on AVP binding, but increased AVP-induced coupling efficacy of the receptor for its G protein. Mutating hydrophilic residues Q108, K128 and Q185 in transmembrane regions II, III and IV, respectively, led to a decrease in affinity for both agonists and antagonists. Finally, the nonconserved residues T333 and A334 in transmembrane region VII, controlled the V1a/V2 binding selectivity for both nonpeptide and cyclic peptide antagonists. Thus, because conserved aromatic residues of the V1a receptor binding pocket seem essential for antagonists and do not contribute at all to the binding of agonists, we propose that these residues differentiate agonist vs. antagonist ligand binding.",European journal of biochemistry,2000
10318826,Contribution of melanocortin receptor exoloops to Agouti-related protein binding.,"Agouti-related protein (AGRP) is an endogenous antagonist of melanocortin action that functions in the hypothalamic control of feeding behavior. Although previous studies have shown that AGRP binds three of the five known subtypes of melanocortin receptor, the receptor domains participating in binding and the molecular interactions involved are presently unknown. The present studies were designed to examine the contribution of extracytoplasmic domains of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) to AGRP binding by making chimerical receptor constructs of the human melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R; a receptor that is not inhibited by AGRP) and the human MC4R (a receptor that is potently inhibited by AGRP). Substitutions of the extracytoplasmic NH2 terminus and the first extracytoplasmic loop (exoloop) of the MC4R with homologous domains of the MC1R had no effect on AGRP (87-132) binding affinity or inhibitory activity (the ability to inhibit melanocortin-stimulated cAMP generation). In contrast, cassette substitutions of exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC4R with the homologous exoloops of the MC1R resulted in a substantial loss of AGRP binding affinity and inhibitory activity. Conversely, the exchange of exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC1R with the homologous exoloops of the MC4R was found to confer AGRP binding and inhibitory activity to the basic structure of the MC1R. Importantly, these substitutions did not affect the ability of the alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone analogue [Nle4,D-Phe7] melanocyte stimulating hormone to bind or activate the chimeric receptors. These data indicate that exoloops 2 and 3 of the melanocortin receptors are important for AGRP binding.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
1717583,Contribution of the repeating domains of membrane cofactor protein (CD46) of the complement system to ligand binding and cofactor activity.,"Membrane cofactor protein (MCP) (CD46) of the C system binds to C3b and C4b, functions as a cofactor for their cleavage, and protects autologous cells from C-mediated injury. The predominant structural motif of MCP is the short consensus repeat (SCR), a repeating domain involved in ligand binding of other related C regulatory proteins. SCR deletion mutants were constructed to determine which of the four SCR of MCP contribute to ligand binding and cofactor activity. ELISA were developed to evaluate binding efficiency of mutants to ligand. Analysis of the deletion mutants indicated that the third and fourth SCR were important for both ligand binding and cofactor activity of C3b (iC3) and C4b. In addition, the same SCR were required for efficient binding of an mAb known to inhibit MCP function. The mutant deleted of SCR-2 bound but lacked cofactor activity for iC3. It did not bind or possess cofactor activity for C4b. Deletion of the first (amino-terminal) SCR had a minimal effect on iC3 binding and cofactor activity but reduced the efficiency of C4b binding. The results identify the SCR of MCP that contribute to ligand binding and cofactor activity. The data also suggest the presence of distinguishable iC3 and C4b binding sites and provide evidence that iC3 binding is not always sufficient for cofactor activity.",,
12496762,Control of hippocampal dendritic spine morphology through ephrin-A3/EphA4 signaling.,"Communication between glial cells and neurons is emerging as a critical parameter of synaptic function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of glial cells to modify synaptic structure and physiology are poorly understood. Here we describe a repulsive interaction that regulates postsynaptic morphology through the EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand ephrin-A3. EphA4 is enriched on dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the adult mouse hippocampus, and ephrin-A3 is localized on astrocytic processes that envelop spines. Activation of EphA4 by ephrin-A3 was found to induce spine retraction, whereas inhibiting ephrin/EphA4 interactions distorted spine shape and organization in hippocampal slices. Furthermore, spine irregularities in pyramidal neurons from EphA4 knockout mice and in slices transfected with kinase-inactive EphA4 indicated that ephrin/EphA4 signaling is critical for spine morphology. Thus, our data support a model in which transient interactions between the ephrin-A3 ligand and the EphA4 receptor regulate the structure of excitatory synaptic connections through neuroglial cross-talk.",,
21102460,Conversion of vascular endothelial cells into multipotent stem-like cells.,"Mesenchymal stem cells can give rise to several cell types, but varying results depending on isolation methods and tissue source have led to controversies about their usefulness in clinical medicine. Here we show that vascular endothelial cells can transform into multipotent stem-like cells by an activin-like kinase-2 (ALK2) receptor-dependent mechanism. In lesions from individuals with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a disease in which heterotopic ossification occurs as a result of activating ALK2 mutations, or from transgenic mice expressing constitutively active ALK2, chondrocytes and osteoblasts expressed endothelial markers. Lineage tracing of heterotopic ossification in mice using a Tie2-Cre construct also suggested an endothelial origin of these cell types. Expression of constitutively active ALK2 in endothelial cells caused endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and acquisition of a stem cell-like phenotype. Similar results were obtained by treatment of untransfected endothelial cells with the ligands transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) or bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) in an ALK2-dependent manner. These stem-like cells could be triggered to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes or adipocytes. We suggest that conversion of endothelial cells to stem-like cells may provide a new approach to tissue engineering.",,
8702701,Converting parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) into a potent PTH-2 receptor agonist.,"Most of the bone and kidney-related functions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) are thought to be mediated by the PTH/PTHrP receptor. Recently, a homologous receptor, the PTH-2 receptor, was obtained from rat and human brain cDNA libraries. This receptor displayed the remarkable property of responding potently to PTH, but not to PTHrP. To begin to define residues involved in the ligand specificity of the PTH-2 receptor, we studied the interaction of several PTH/PTHrP hybrid ligands and other related peptide analogs with the human PTH-2 receptor. The results showed that two sites in PTH and PTHrP fully account for the different potencies that the two ligands exhibited with PTH-2 receptors; residue 5 (His in PTHrP and Ile in PTH) determined signaling capability, while residue 23 (Phe in PTHrP and Trp in PTH) determined binding affinity. By changing these two residues of PTHrP to the corresponding residues of PTH, we were able to convert PTHrP into a ligand that avidly bound to the PTH-2 receptor and fully and potently stimulated cAMP formation. Changing residue 23 alone yielded [Trp23]hPTHrP-(1-36), which was an antagonist for the PTH-2 receptor, but a full agonist for the PTH/PTHrP receptor. Residues 5 and 23 in PTH and PTHrP thus play key roles in signaling and binding interactions, respectively, with the PTH-2 receptor. Receptor-selective agonists and antagonists derived from these studies could help to identify the biological role of the PTH-2 receptor and to map specific sites of ligand-receptor interaction.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
17051153,Corneal avascularity is due to soluble VEGF receptor-1.,"Corneal avascularity-the absence of blood vessels in the cornea-is required for optical clarity and optimal vision, and has led to the cornea being widely used for validating pro- and anti-angiogenic therapeutic strategies for many disorders. But the molecular underpinnings of the avascular phenotype have until now remained obscure and are all the more remarkable given the presence in the cornea of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a potent stimulator of angiogenesis, and the proximity of the cornea to vascularized tissues. Here we show that the cornea expresses soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1; also known as sflt-1) and that suppression of this endogenous VEGF-A trap by neutralizing antibodies, RNA interference or Cre-lox-mediated gene disruption abolishes corneal avascularity in mice. The spontaneously vascularized corneas of corn1 and Pax6+/- mice and Pax6+/- patients with aniridia are deficient in sflt-1, and recombinant sflt-1 administration restores corneal avascularity in corn1 and Pax6+/- mice. Manatees, the only known creatures uniformly to have vascularized corneas, do not express sflt-1, whereas the avascular corneas of dugongs, also members of the order Sirenia, elephants, the closest extant terrestrial phylogenetic relatives of manatees, and other marine mammals (dolphins and whales) contain sflt-1, indicating that it has a crucial, evolutionarily conserved role. The recognition that sflt-1 is essential for preserving the avascular ambit of the cornea can rationally guide its use as a platform for angiogenic modulators, supports its use in treating neovascular diseases, and might provide insight into the immunological privilege of the cornea.",Nature,2006

10816663,Corticotropin releasing factor receptors and their ligand family.,"The CRF receptors belong to the VIP/GRF/PTH family of G-protein coupled receptors whose actions are mediated through activation of adenylate cyclase. Two CRF receptors, encoded by distinct genes, CRF-R1 and CRF-R2, and that can exist in two alternatively spliced forms, have been cloned. The type-1 receptor is expressed in many areas of the rodent brain, as well as in the pituitary, gonads, and skin. In the rodent, one splice variant of the type-2 receptor, CRF-R2 alpha, is expressed mainly in the brain, whereas the other variant, CRF-R2 beta, is found not only in the CNS, but also in cardiac and skeletal muscle, epididymis, and the gastrointestinal tract. The poor correlation between the sites of expression of CRF-R2 and CRF, as well as the relatively low affinity of CRF for CRF-R2, suggested the presence of another ligand, whose existence was confirmed in our cloning of urocortin. This CRF-like peptide is found not only in brain, but also in peripheral sites, such as lymphocytes. The broad tissue distribution of CRF receptors and their ligands underscores the important role of this system in maintenance of homeostasis. Functional studies of the two receptor types reveal differences in the specificity for CRF and related ligands. On the basis of its greater affinity for urocortin, in comparison with CRF, as well as its brain distribution, CRF-R2 may be the cognate receptor for urocortin. Mutagenesis studies of CRF receptors directed toward understanding the basis for their specificity, provide insight into the structural determinants for hormone-receptor recognition and signal transduction.",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,1999
9851694,"Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1 from Tupaia belangeri--cloning, functional expression and tissue distribution.","A cDNA clone encoding corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) type 1 (CRF-R1) has been isolated from the tree shrew Tupaia belangeri with a PCR-based approach. The full-length cDNA encoded a 415-amino-acid protein with highest sequence identity (approximately 98%) to human CRF-R1 and slightly less identity to rat or mouse CRF-R1 (approximately 97%). Only eight amino acids (residues 3, 4, 6, 35, 36 and 39 in the N-terminus, residue 232 in transmembrane domain 4 and residue 410 in the C-terminus) differed between tree shrew CRF-R1 (tCRF-R1) and human CRF-R1 (hCRF-R1). tCRF-R1 mRNA was detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR and RNase protection analysis in the pituitary and in brain areas such as amygdala, brainstem, cerebellum, cortex, olfactory bulb, and striatum. In peripheral organs, only weak expression of tCRF-R1 mRNA was observed in ovary, testis, and adrenal gland. Binding studies using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably transfected with tCRF-R1 showed that the CRF agonists ovine CRF (KD = 1.28 nM), human/rat CRF (KD = 1.09 nM), urocortin (KD = 0.37 nM) and sauvagine (KD = 0.77 nM), respectively, were bound with significantly higher affinities than the CRF antagonist astressin (KD = 12.4 nM). In agreement with the binding data half maximum effective EC50 values of 0.83 nM (human/rat CRF), 1.41 nM (ovine CRF), 1.25 nM (rat urocortin) and 0.71 nM (sauvagine) were calculated when the cAMP production in HEK293 cells stably transfected with tCRF-R1 was stimulated with the four CRF analogues. These data underline the close relationship between human and tree shrew CRF-R1.",,
11227737,"Cortistatin, but not somatostatin, binds to growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) receptors of human pituitary gland.","Antagonism between GH secretagogues (GHS) and somatostatin (SRIH) has been postulated and demonstrated, but SRIH does not bind to GHS receptors (GHS-R) and potent synthetic peptidyl GHS (GHRP6, hexarelin) do not displace radiolabeled SRIH from its receptors. However, non-natural SRIH octapeptide agonists (mainly lanreotide and vapreotide) displace 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin from pituitary binding sites suggesting that an endogenous factor related to SRIH might exist and interact with GHS-R. Our aims were to investigate the ability of different SRIH-like peptides such as various SRIH fragments (SRIH 3-14, SRIH 7-14, SRIH 3-10, SRIH 7-10, SRIH 2-9) and a natural neuropeptide that shows a high structural homology with SRIH such as cortistatin-14 (CST) to compete with 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin for human pituitary binding sites and to compare their binding affinity with that of hexarelin and ghrelin, a gastric-derived peptidyl GHS that has been proposed as a natural ligand of GHS-R. While the binding of 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin to pituitary membranes was completely displaced by unlabelled hexarelin, ghrelin and CST, none of the SRIH fragments tested inhibited this binding. Ghrelin and CST exhibited a similar affinity (4.6-5.4 x 10(-7) mol/l) for the binding while hexarelin was more effective by about four orders of magnitude in displacing 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin. Our data demonstrate for the first time that cortistatin, a natural peptide related to SRIH, binds to GHS-R and suggest that this factor may play a role in modulating the activity of these receptors.",,
11011067,Cortistatin: a member of the somatostatin neuropeptide family with distinct physiological functions.,"Cortistatin is a recently discovered neuropeptide relative of somatostatin named after its predominantly cortical expression and ability to depress cortical activity. Cortistatin-14 shares 11 of the 14 amino acids of somatostatin-14 yet their nucleotide sequences and chromosomal localization clearly indicate they are products of separate genes. Now cloned from human, mouse and rat sources, cortistatin is known to bind all five cloned somatostatin receptors and share many pharmacological and functional properties with somatostatin including the depression of neuronal activity. However, cortistatin also has many properties distinct from somatostatin including induction of slow-wave sleep, apparently by antagonism of the excitatory effects of acetylcholine on the cortex, reduction of locomotor activity, and activation of cation selective currents not responsive to somatostatin. Expression of mRNA encoding cortistatin follows a circadian rhythm and is upregulated on deprivation of sleep, suggesting cortistatin is a sleep modulatory factor. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of cortistatin, examines the similarities and differences between cortistatin and somatostatin, and asks the question: does cortistatin bind to a cortistatin-specific receptor?",Brain research.

12121226,Costimulation of T cell receptor-triggered IL-2 production by Jurkat T cells via fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 upon its engagement by CD56.,"Recent studies have demonstrated that neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is involved in multiple adhesive interactions with several different classes of ligands on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. One of these ligands is fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) that is expressed on neural cells. While it is known that CD56 is a molecular isoform of NCAM expressed on human NK cells and a subset of T cells, it remains poorly characterized, with its ligand unidentified. Therefore, we were prompted to examine if CD56 molecules on NK cells interact with FGFR expressed on T cells. We demonstrate that ligation of FGFR1 beta on J.C2-14 Jurkat T cells by CD56 on fixed NK-92 cells costimulates TCR/CD3-triggered IL-2 production. CD56-binding mAbs inhibited the costimulatory effect of NK-92 cells in 50-75%. Flow cytometric analysis and cell adhesion assays showed that FGFR1 beta/Fc and FGFR2 beta/Fc chimeric proteins bind to NK-92 cells. The binding of FGFR1 beta/Fc protein to CD56 molecules was verified by immunoprecipitation of CD56 with anti-CD56 mAb followed by Western blotting with FGFR1 beta/Fc. These findings suggest that ligation of FGFR1 by CD56 may contribute to the interaction between NK cells and T cells that we have postulated in our previous studies.",Immunology and cell biology,2002
16212421,Coupling interaction between thromboxane A2 receptor and alpha-13 subunit of guanine nucleotide-binding protein.,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form a large superfamily of membrane proteins that play an essential role in modulating many vital physiological events, such as cell communication, neurotransmission, sensory perception, and chemotaxis. Understanding of the 3D (dimensional) structures of these receptors and their binding interactions with G proteins will help in the design of drugs for the treatment of GPCR-related diseases. By means of the approach of structural bioinformatics, the 3D structures of human alpha-13 subunit of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G alpha 13) and human thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor were developed. The former plays an important role in the control of cell growth that may serve as a prototypical G protein; the latter is a target for nitric oxide-mediated desensitization that may serve as a prototypical GPCR. On the basis of the 3D models, their coupling interactions were investigated via docking studies. It has been found that the two proteins are coupled with each other mainly through the interaction between the minigene of G alpha 13 and the 3rd intracellular loop of the TXA2 receptor, consistent with the existing deduction in the literatures. However, it has also been observed via a close view that some residues of the TXA2 receptor that are sequentially far away but spatially quite close to the loop region are also involved in forming hydrogen bonds with the minigene of G alpha 13. These findings may provide useful information for conducting mutagenesis and reveal the molecular mechanism how the human TXA2 receptor interact with G alpha 13 to activate intracellular signaling. The findings may also provide useful insights for stimulating new therapeutic approaches by manipulating the interaction of the receptor with the relevant G proteins.",Journal of proteome research,2005
19144685,Coupling of beta2-adrenoceptors to XLalphas and Galphas: a new insight into ligand-induced G protein activation.,"Galpha(s) and extra-large Galpha(s) (XLalpha(s)) can both transduce receptor activation into intracellular cAMP generation. It is unknown, however, whether these two GNAS-locus products display distinct properties with respect to receptor coupling. Here, we show that XLalpha(s) couples to the beta2-adrenoceptor more efficiently than Galpha(s). In transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts null for both Galpha(s) and XLalpha(s) (2B2 cells), basal cAMP accumulation mediated by XLalpha(s) was higher than that mediated by Galpha(s). Inverse agonist treatment reduced Galpha(s)-mediated basal activity, whereas its effect was markedly blunted on XLalpha(s)-mediated basal activity. Rank order of ligand efficacies regarding cAMP accumulation was the same when the receptor was coupled to XLalpha(s) or Galpha(s). However, ligand-induced and XLalpha(s)-mediated cAMP generation was higher than that mediated by Galpha(s). The relatively high efficiency of XLalpha(s)-mediated cAMP generation was conditional, disappearing with increased level of receptor expression or increased efficacy of ligand. Full-agonist responses in XLalpha(s)- and Galpha(s)-expressing cells were comparable even at low receptor levels, whereas partial agonist responses became comparable only when the receptor expression was increased (>3 pmol/mg). Radioligand binding studies showed that the high-affinity component in agonist binding to beta2-adrenoceptor was more pronounced in cells expressing XLalpha(s) than those expressing Galpha(s). We discuss these findings in the framework of current receptor-G protein activation models and offer an extended ternary complex model that can fully explain our observations.",,
11120746,Coupling of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor tyrosine kinase to Gi2 in human intestinal smooth muscle: Gbetagamma -dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and growth.,"Endogenous insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) stimulates growth of cultured human intestinal smooth muscle by activating distinct mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-dependent and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways. In Rat1 and Balb/c3T3 fibroblasts and in neurons the IGF-I receptor is coupled to an inhibitory G protein, G(i), which mediates G(beta)gamma-dependent MAP kinase activation. The present study determined whether in normal human intestinal smooth muscle cells the IGF-I receptor activates a heterotrimeric G protein and the role of G protein activation in mediating IGF-I-induced growth. IGF-I elicited IGF-I receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in the specific activation of G(i2). G(beta)gamma subunits selectively mediated IGF-I-dependent MAP kinase activation; G(alpha)i2 subunits selectively mediated IGF-I-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. IGF-I-stimulated MAP kinase activation and growth were inhibited by pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of G(i)/G(o) activation. Cyclic AMP inhibits growth of human intestinal muscle cells. IGF-I inhibited both basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. This inhibition was attenuated in the presence of pertussis toxin. IGF-I stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, in contrast to MAP kinase activation, occurred independently of G(i2) activation. These data suggest that IGF-I specifically activates G(i2), resulting in concurrent G(beta)gamma-dependent stimulation of MAP kinase activity and growth, and G(alpha)i2-dependent inhibition of cAMP levels resulting in disinhibition of cAMP-mediated growth suppression.",,
12682303,Cripto forms a complex with activin and type II activin receptors and can block activin signaling.,"Activin, nodal, Vg1, and growth and differentiation factor 1 are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily and signal via the activin type II (ActRII/IIB) and type I (ALK4) serine/threonine kinase receptors. Unlike activins, however, signaling by nodal, Vg1, and growth and differentiation factor 1 requires a coreceptor from the epidermal growth factor-Cripto-FRL1-Cryptic protein family such as Cripto. Cripto has important roles during development and oncogenesis and binds nodal or related ligands and ALK4 to facilitate assembly of type I and type II receptor signaling complexes. Because Cripto mediates signaling via activin receptors and binds directly to ALK4, we tested whether transfection with Cripto would affect the ability of activin to signal and/or interact with its receptors. Here we show that Cripto can form a complex with activin and ActRII/IIB. We were unable to detect activin binding to Cripto in the absence of ActRII/IIB, indicating that unlike nodal, activin requires type II receptors to bind Cripto. If cotransfected with ActRII/IIB and ALK4, Cripto inhibited crosslinking of activin to ALK4 and the association of ALK4 with ActRII/IIB. In addition, Cripto blocked activin signaling when transfected into either HepG2 cells or 293T cells. We have also shown that under conditions in which Cripto facilitates nodal signaling, it antagonizes activin. Inhibition of activin signaling provides an additional example of a Cripto effect on the regulation of signaling by transforming growth factor-beta superfamily members. Because activin is a potent inhibitor of cell growth in multiple cell types, these results provide a mechanism that may partially explain the oncogenic action of Cripto.",,
11909953,Cripto-1 activates nodal- and ALK4-dependent and -independent signaling pathways in mammary epithelial Cells.,"Cripto-1 (CR-1), an epidermal growth factor-CFC (EGF-CFC) family member, has a demonstrated role in embryogenesis and mammary gland development and is overexpressed in several human tumors. Recently, EGF-CFC proteins were implicated as essential signaling cofactors for Nodal, a transforming growth factor beta family member whose expression has previously been defined as embryo specific. To identify a receptor for CR-1, a human brain cDNA phage display library was screened using CR-1 protein as bait. Phage inserts with identity to ALK4, a type I serine/threonine kinase receptor for Activin, were identified. CR-1 binds to cell surface ALK4 expressed on mammalian epithelial cells in fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, as well as by coimmunoprecipitation. Nodal is coexpressed with mouse Cr-1 in the mammary gland, and CR-1 can phosphorylate the transcription factor Smad-2 in EpH-4 mammary epithelial cells only in the presence of Nodal and ALK4. In contrast, CR-1 stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT in these cells is independent of Nodal and ALK4, suggesting that CR-1 may modulate different signaling pathways to mediate its different functional roles.",,
7782300,Critical contributions of amino-terminal extracellular domains in agonist binding and activation of secretin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptors. Studies of chimeric receptors.,"Secretin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) receptors are closely related G protein-coupled receptors in a recently described family possessing a large amino-terminal ectodomain. We postulated that this domain might be critical for agonist recognition and therefore constructed a series of six chimeric receptors, exchanging the amino terminus, the first extracellular loop, or both in secretin and VIP receptors. Constructs were expressed in COS cells and characterized by cAMP generation and binding of both secretin and VIP radio-ligands. Wild type receptors demonstrated high affinity binding of respective ligands (IC50 values (in nM): at the secretin receptor: 2.2 for secretin, > 1000 for VIP; at the VIP receptor: 2.2 for VIP, > 1000 for secretin) and appropriately sensitive and selective biological responses (EC50 values (in nM): at the secretin receptor: 1.5 for secretin, 127 for VIP; at the VIP receptor: 1.0 for VIP, 273 for secretin). Replacement of the secretin receptor amino terminus with that of the VIP receptor resulted in biological responsiveness typical of the VIP receptor (EC50 = 120 nM for secretin, 1.7 nM for VIP). The converse was not true, with this domain of the secretin receptor not able to provide the same response when incorporated into the VIP receptor (EC50 = 50 nM for VIP, 30 nM for secretin). The addition of both the first loop and the amino terminus of the secretin receptor was effective in yielding a secretin receptor-like response (EC50 = 2.0 nM for secretin, 47 nM for VIP). All chimeric constructs expressing selectivity for secretin-stimulated activity bound this hormone with high affinity (IC50 = 0.2-2.2 nM); however, there was divergence between VIP binding and biological activity. Thus, the amino terminus of secretin and VIP receptors plays a key role in agonist recognition and responsiveness, with the first loop playing a critical complementary role for the secretin receptor.",,
7963560,Cross-linking of CD53 promotes activation of resting human B lymphocytes.,"The CD53 pan-leukocyte glycoprotein is a member of the recently described tetraspan family of cell membrane proteins. The structure and functional characteristics of these molecules indicate that they may play important roles in transmembrane signaling in different cells. Recently, it was reported that cross-linking of CD53 on human B cells led to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium fluxes. In the present study, we wished to further explore the possible role of CD53 in functional B cell responses. Cross-linking of CD53 with the use of the mAb MEM-53 and a polyclonal sheep anti-mouse Ig promoted activation of resting B cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle as judged by increased expression of the early activation Ag CD69, increases in cellular volume, RNA synthesis, and c-myc protein levels, and enhanced binding of 7-aminoactinomycin D. In contrast, MEM-53 alone had no detectable effects. Cross-linking of anti-CD53 induced negligible S phase entry in the absence of other stimuli. However, cytokines, in particular IL-2 and IL-4, potentiated the DNA synthesis induced by cross-linking of CD53. Furthermore, cross-linking of the CD53 Ag induced Ig production in the presence of T cell supernatant. Taken together, the data suggest that CD53 plays an important functional role in B cell activation and differentiation.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1994

25163760,Crystal structure and its bearing towards an understanding of key biological functions of EpCAM.,"EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule), a stem and carcinoma cell marker, is a cell surface protein involved in homotypic cell-cell adhesion via intercellular oligomerization and proliferative signalling via proteolytic cleavage. Despite its use as a diagnostic marker and being a drug target, structural details of this conserved vertebrate-exclusive protein remain unknown. Here we present the crystal structure of a heart-shaped dimer of the extracellular part of human EpCAM. The structure represents a cis-dimer that would form at cell surfaces and may provide the necessary structural foundation for the proposed EpCAM intercellular trans-tetramerization mediated by a membrane-distal region. By combining biochemical, biological and structural data on EpCAM, we show how proteolytic processing at various sites could influence structural integrity, oligomeric state and associated functionality of the molecule. We also describe the epitopes of this therapeutically important protein and explain the antigenicity of its regions.",Nature communications,2014

Heparin also interacts with FGFR in the adjoining 1:1 FGF:FGFR complex to promote FGFR dimerization. The 6-O-sulfate group of heparin plays a pivotal role in mediating both interactions. The unexpected stoichiometry of heparin binding in the structure led us to propose a revised model for FGFR dimerization. Biochemical data in support of this model are also presented. This model provides a structural basis for FGFR activation by small molecule heparin analogs and may facilitate the design of heparin mimetics capable of modulating FGF signaling.",Molecular cell,2000
12297049,Crystal structure of a truncated epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular domain bound to transforming growth factor alpha.,"We report the crystal structure, at 2.5 A resolution, of a truncated human EGFR ectodomain bound to TGFalpha. TGFalpha interacts with both L1 and L2 domains of EGFR, making many main chain contacts with L1 and interacting with L2 via key conserved residues. The results indicate how EGFR family members can bind a family of highly variable ligands. In the 2:2 TGFalpha:sEGFR501 complex, each ligand interacts with only one receptor molecule. There are two types of dimers in the asymmetric unit: a head-to-head dimer involving contacts between the L1 and L2 domains and a back-to-back dimer dominated by interactions between the CR1 domains of each receptor. Based on sequence conservation, buried surface area, and mutagenesis experiments, the back-to-back dimer is favored to be biologically relevant.",Cell,2002
11780069,Crystal structure of an Eph receptor-ephrin complex.,"The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their membrane-anchored ephrin ligands are important in regulating cell-cell interactions as they initiate a unique bidirectional signal transduction cascade whereby information is communicated into both the Eph-expressing and the ephrin-expressing cells. Initially identified as regulators of axon pathfinding and neuronal cell migration, Ephs and ephrins are now known to have roles in many other cell-cell interactions, including those of vascular endothelial cells and specialized epithelia. Here we report the crystal structure of the complex formed between EphB2 and ephrin-B2, determined at 2.7 A resolution. Each Eph receptor binds an ephrin ligand through an expansive dimerization interface dominated by the insertion of an extended ephrin loop into a channel at the surface of the receptor. Two Eph-Ephrin dimers then join to form a tetramer, in which each ligand interacts with two receptors and each receptor interacts with two ligands. The Eph and ephrin molecules are precisely positioned and orientated in these complexes, promoting higher-order clustering and the initiation of bidirectional signalling.",,
15851468,Crystal structure of BMP-9 and functional interactions with pro-region and receptors.,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), a subset of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily, regulate a diverse array of cellular functions during development and in the adult. BMP-9 (also known as growth and differentiation factor (GDF)-2) potently induces osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, has been implicated in the differentiation of cholinergic neurons, and may help regulate glucose metabolism. We have determined the structure of BMP-9 to 2.3 A and examined the differences between our model and existing crystal structures of other BMPs, both in isolation and in complex with their receptors. TGF-beta ligands are translated as precursors, with pro-regions that generally dissociate after cleavage from the ligand, but in some cases (including GDF-8 and TGF-beta1, -2, and -3), the pro-region remains associated after secretion from the cell and inhibits binding of the ligand to its receptor. Although the proregion of BMP-9 remains tightly associated after secretion, we find, in several cell-based assays, that the activities of BMP-9 and BMP-9.pro-region complex were equivalent. Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1), an orphan receptor in the TGF-beta family, was also identified as a potential receptor for BMP-9 based on surface plasmon resonance studies (BIAcore) and the ability of soluble ALK-1 to block the activity of BMP-9.pro-region complex in cell-based assays.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2005
12833155,Crystal structure of CD1a in complex with a sulfatide self antigen at a resolution of 2.15 A.,"CD1 antigens bind a variety of self and foreign lipid and glycolipid antigens for presentation to CD1-restricted T cell receptors (TCRs). Here we report the crystal structure of human CD1a in complex with a sulfatide self antigen at a resolution of 2.15 A. The lipid adopts an S-shaped conformation, with the sphingosine chain completely buried in the A' pocket and the fatty acid chain emerging from the interface of the A' pocket into the more exposed F' pocket. The headgroup is anchored in the A'-F' junction and protrudes into the F' pocket for TCR recognition. Because the A' pocket is narrow with a fixed terminus, it can act as a molecular 'ruler' to select alkyl chains of a particular length.",Nature immunology,2003
11069186,Crystal structure of fibroblast growth factor receptor ectodomain bound to ligand and heparin.,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a large family of structurally related proteins with a wide range of physiological and pathological activities. Signal transduction requires association of FGF with its receptor tyrosine kinase (FGFR) and heparan sulphate proteoglycan in a specific complex on the cell surface. Direct involvement of the heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide in the molecular association between FGF and its receptor is essential for biological activity. Although crystal structures of binary complexes of FGF-heparin and FGF-FGFR have been described, the molecular architecture of the FGF signalling complex has not been elucidated. Here we report the crystal structure of the FGFR2 ectodomain in a dimeric form that is induced by simultaneous binding to FGF1 and a heparin decasaccharide. The complex is assembled around a central heparin molecule linking two FGF1 ligands into a dimer that bridges between two receptor chains. The asymmetric heparin binding involves contacts with both FGF1 molecules but only one receptor chain. The structure of the FGF1-FGFR2-heparin ternary complex provides a structural basis for the essential role of heparan sulphate in FGF signalling.",,
12897781,"Crystal structure of HLA-A2 bound to LIR-1, a host and viral major histocompatibility complex receptor.","Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LIR-1), an inhibitory receptor expressed on monocytes, dendritic cells and lymphocytes, regulates cellular function by binding a broad range of classical and nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, and the human cytomegalovirus MHC class I homolog UL18. Here we describe the 3.4-A crystal structure of a complex between the LIR-1 D1D2 domains and the MHC class I molecule HLA-A2. LIR-1 contacts the mostly conserved beta(2)-microglobulin and alpha3 domains of HLA-A2. The LIR-1 binding site comprises residues at the interdomain hinge, and a patch at the D1 tip. The structure shows how LIR-1 recognizes UL18 and diverse MHC class I molecules, and indicates that a similar mode of MHC class I recognition is used by other LIR family members.",Nature immunology,2003
15718280,Crystal structure of HLA-G: a nonclassical MHC class I molecule expressed at the fetal-maternal interface.,"HLA-G is a nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecule that is primarily expressed at the fetal-maternal interface, where it is thought to play a role in protecting the fetus from the maternal immune response. HLA-G binds a limited repertoire of peptides and interacts with the inhibitory leukocyte Ig-like receptors LIR-1 and LIR-2 and possibly with certain natural killer cell receptors. To gain further insights into HLA-G function, we determined the 1.9-A structure of a monomeric HLA-G complexed to a natural endogenous peptide ligand from histone H2A (RIIPRHLQL). An extensive network of contacts between the peptide and the antigen-binding cleft reveal a constrained mode of binding reminiscent of the nonclassical HLA-E molecule, thereby providing a structural basis for the limited peptide repertoire of HLA-G. The alpha3 domain of HLA-G, a candidate binding site for the LIR-1 and -2 inhibitory receptors, is structurally distinct from the alpha3 domains of classical MHC-I molecules, providing a rationale for the observed affinity differences for these ligands. The structural data suggest a head-to-tail mode of dimerization, mediated by an intermolecular disulfide bond, that is consistent with the observation of HLA-G dimers on the cell surface.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2005
8897595,Crystal structure of human interleukin-10 at 1.6 A resolution and a model of a complex with its soluble receptor.,"The crystal structure of human interleukin-10 (IL-10) was refined at 1.6 A resolution against X-ray diffraction data collected at 100 K with the use of synchrotron radiation. Although similar to the IL-10 structure determined previously at room temperature, this low-temperature IL-10 structure contains, in addition, four N-terminal residues, three sulfate anions, and 175 extra water molecules. Whereas the main-chain conformation is preserved, about 30% of the side chains, most of them on the protein surface, assume different conformations. A computer model of a complex of IL-10 with its two soluble receptors was generated based on the topological similarity of IL-10 to interferon-gamma. The contact region between the cytokine and each receptor shows excellent complementarity of polar and hydrophobic interactions, suggesting that the model is generally correct and should be useful in guiding mutagenesis experiments.",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,1996
10490030,Crystal structure of nerve growth factor in complex with the ligand-binding domain of the TrkA receptor.,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is involved in a variety of processes involving signalling, such as cell differentiation and survival, growth cessation and apoptosis of neurons. These events are mediated by NGF as a result of binding to its two cell-surface receptors, TrkA and p75. TrkA is a receptor with tyrosine kinase activity that forms a high-affinity binding site for NGF. Of the five domains comprising its extracellular portion, the immunoglobulin-like domain proximal to the membrane (TrkA-d5 domain) is necessary and sufficient for NGF binding. Here we present the crystal structure of human NGF in complex with human TrkA-d5 at 2.2 A resolution. The ligand-receptor interface consists of two patches of similar size. One patch involves the central beta-sheet that forms the core of the homodimeric NGF molecule and the loops at the carboxy-terminal pole of TrkA-d5. The second patch comprises the amino-terminal residues of NGF, which adopt a helical conformation upon complex formation, packing against the 'ABED' sheet of TrkA-d5. The structure is consistent with results from mutagenesis experiments for all neurotrophins, and indicates that the first patch may constitute a conserved binding motif for all family members, whereas the second patch is specific for the interaction between NGF and TrkA.",,
10881198,Crystal structure of the BMP-2-BRIA ectodomain complex.,Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the large transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. BMP-2 can induce ectopic bone and cartilage formation in adult vertebrates and is involved in central steps in early embryonal development in animals. Signaling by these cytokines requires binding of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinase chains classified as type I and type II. Here we report the crystal structure of human dimeric BMP-2 in complex with two high affinity BMP receptor IA extracellular domains (BRIAec). The receptor chains bind to the 'wrist' epitopes of the BMP-2 dimer and contact both BMP-2 monomers. No contacts exist between the receptor domains. The model reveals the structural basis for discrimination between type I and type II receptors and the variability of receptor-ligand interactions that is seen in BMP-TGF-beta systems.,,
12297050,Crystal structure of the complex of human epidermal growth factor and receptor extracellular domains.,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulates cell proliferation and differentiation by binding to the EGF receptor (EGFR) extracellular region, comprising domains I-IV, with the resultant dimerization of the receptor tyrosine kinase. In this study, the crystal structure of a 2:2 complex of human EGF and the EGFR extracellular region has been determined at 3.3 A resolution. EGFR domains I-III are arranged in a C shape, and EGF is docked between domains I and III. The 1:1 EGF*EGFR complex dimerizes through a direct receptor*receptor interaction, in which a protruding beta-hairpin arm of each domain II holds the body of the other. The unique ""receptor-mediated dimerization"" was verified by EGFR mutagenesis.",,
11733492,Crystal structure of the extracellular domain of mouse RANK ligand at 2.2-A resolution.,"Bone remodeling involves the resorption of bone by osteoclasts and the synthesis of bone matrix by osteoblasts. Receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand (RANKL, also known as ODF and OPGL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, triggers osteoclastogenesis by forming a complex with its receptor, RANK. We have determined the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of mouse RANKL at 2.2-A resolution. The structure reveals that the RANKL extracellular domain is trimeric, which was also shown by analytical ultracentrifugation, and each subunit has a beta-strand jellyroll topology like the other members of the TNF family. A comparison of RANKL with TNF beta and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), whose structures were determined to be in the complex form with their respective receptor, reveals conserved and specific features of RANKL in the TNF superfamily and suggests the presence of key residues of RANKL for receptor binding.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
15167892,Crystal structure of the HGF beta-chain in complex with the Sema domain of the Met receptor.,"The Met tyrosine kinase receptor and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), play important roles in normal development and in tumor growth and metastasis. HGF-dependent signaling requires proteolysis from an inactive single-chain precursor into an active alpha/beta-heterodimer. We show that the serine protease-like HGF beta-chain alone binds Met, and report its crystal structure in complex with the Sema and PSI domain of the Met receptor. The Met Sema domain folds into a seven-bladed beta-propeller, where the bottom face of blades 2 and 3 binds to the HGF beta-chain 'active site region'. Mutation of HGF residues in the area that constitutes the active site region in related serine proteases significantly impairs HGF beta binding to Met. Key binding loops in this interface undergo conformational rearrangements upon maturation and explain the necessity of proteolytic cleavage for proper HGF signaling. A crystallographic dimer interface between two HGF beta-chains brings two HGF beta:Met complexes together, suggesting a possible mechanism of Met receptor dimerization and activation by HGF.",,
11323700,Crystal structure of the human natural killer cell inhibitory receptor KIR2DL1-HLA-Cw4 complex.,"Inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell receptors down-regulate the cytotoxicity of NK cells upon recognition of specific class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on target cells. We report here the crystal structure of the inhibitory human killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 2DL1 (KIR2DL1) bound to its class I MHC ligand, HLA-Cw4. The KIR2DL1-HLA-Cw4 interface exhibits charge and shape complementarity. Specificity is mediated by a pocket in KIR2DL1 that hosts the Lys80 residue of HLA-Cw4. Many residues conserved in HLA-C and in KIR2DL receptors make different interactions in KIR2DL1-HLA-Cw4 and in a previously reported KIR2DL2-HLA-Cw3 complex. A dimeric aggregate of KIR-HLA-C complexes was observed in one KIR2DL1-HLA-Cw4 crystal. Most of the amino acids that differ between human and chimpanzee KIRs with HLA-C specificities form solvent-accessible clusters outside the KIR-HLA interface, which suggests undiscovered interactions by KIRs.",Nature immunology,2001
11850637,Crystal structure of the human TbetaR2 ectodomain--TGF-beta3 complex.,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is the prototype of a large family of structurally related cytokines that play key roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis by signaling through two classes of functionally distinct Ser/Thr kinase receptors, designated as type I and type II. TGF-beta initiates receptor assembly by binding with high affinity to the type II receptor. Here, we present the 2.15 A crystal structure of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human TGF-beta type II receptor (ecTbetaR2) in complex with human TGF-beta3. ecTbetaR2 interacts with homodimeric TGF-beta3 by binding identical finger segments at opposite ends of the growth factor. Relative to the canonical 'closed' conformation previously observed in ligand structures across the superfamily, ecTbetaR2-bound TGF-beta3 shows an altered arrangement of its monomeric subunits, designated the 'open' conformation. The mode of TGF-beta3 binding shown by ecTbetaR2 is compatible with both ligand conformations. This, in addition to the predicted mode for TGF-beta binding to the type I receptor ectodomain (ecTbetaR1), suggests an assembly mechanism in which ecTbetaR1 and ecTbetaR2 bind at adjacent positions on the ligand surface and directly contact each other via protein--protein interactions.",Nature structural biology,2002
11485736,Crystal structure of the IL-10/IL-10R1 complex reveals a shared receptor binding site.,Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a dimeric cytokine that plays a central role in suppressing inflammatory responses. These activities are dependent on the interaction of IL-10 with its high-affinity receptor (IL-10R1). This intermediate complex must subsequently recruit the low-affinity IL-10R2 chain before cell signaling can occur. Here we report the 2.9 A crystal structure of IL-10 bound to a soluble form of IL-10R1 (sIL-10R1). The complex consists of two IL-10s and four sIL-10R1 molecules. Several residues in the IL-10/sIL-10R1 interface are conserved in all IL-10 homologs and their receptors. The data suggests that formation of the active IL-10 signaling complex occurs by a novel molecular recognition paradigm where IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 both recognize the same binding site on IL-10.,Immunity,2001
12087105,Crystal structure of the platelet glycoprotein Ib(alpha) N-terminal domain reveals an unmasking mechanism for receptor activation.,"Glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) is a platelet receptor with a critical role in mediating the arrest of platelets at sites of vascular damage. GPIb binds to the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (vWF-A1) at high blood shear, initiating platelet adhesion and contributing to the formation of a thrombus. To investigate the molecular basis of GPIb regulation and ligand binding, we have determined the structure of the N-terminal domain of the GPIb(alpha) chain (residues 1-279). This structure is the first determined from the cell adhesion/signaling class of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins and reveals the topology of the characteristic disulfide-bonded flanking regions. The fold consists of an N-terminal beta-hairpin, eight leucine-rich repeats, a disulfide-bonded loop, and a C-terminal anionic region. The structure also demonstrates a novel LRR motif in the form of an M-shaped arrangement of three tandem beta-turns. Negatively charged binding surfaces on the LRR concave face and anionic region indicate two-step binding kinetics to vWF-A1, which can be regulated by an unmasking mechanism involving conformational change of a key loop. Using molecular docking of the GPIb and vWF-A1 crystal structures, we were also able to model the GPIb.vWF-A1 complex.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
8387891,Crystal structure of the soluble human 55 kd TNF receptor-human TNF beta complex: implications for TNF receptor activation.,"The X-ray crystal structure of the complex of the extracellular domain of the human 55 kd tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor with human TNF beta has been determined at 2.85 A resolution. The complex has three receptor molecules bound symmetrically to one TNF beta trimer. The receptor fragment, a very elongated end to end assembly of four similar folding domains, binds in the groove between two adjacent TNF beta subunits. The structure of the complex defines the orientation of the ligand with respect to the cell membrane and provides a model for TNF receptor activation. The novel fold of the TNF receptor structure is likely to be representative of the nerve growth factor (NGF)/TNF receptor family as a whole.",,
11581298,Crystal structure of the TRANCE/RANKL cytokine reveals determinants of receptor-ligand specificity.,"RANK, the receptor activator of NF-kappaB, and its ligand RANKL (initially termed TRANCE, also termed ODF and OPGL), are a TNF superfamily receptor-ligand pair that govern the development and function of osteoclasts, lymphoid tissue, and mammary epithelium. While TNF family cytokines share a common structural scaffold, individual receptor-ligand pairs associate with high specificity. Given the low level of amino acid conservation among members of the TNF superfamily, the means by which these molecules achieve specificity cannot be completely understood without knowledge of their three-dimensional structures. To determine the elements of RANKL that mediate RANK activation, we have crystallized the ectodomain of murine RANKL and solved its structure to a resolution of 2.6 A. RANKL self-associates as a homotrimer with four unique surface loops that distinguish it from other TNF family cytokines. Mutagenesis of selected residues in these loops significantly modulates RANK activation, as evidenced by in vitro osteoclastogenesis, thereby establishing their necessity in mediating the biological activities of RANKL. Such structural determinants of RANKL-RANK specificity may be of relevance in the pharmacologic design of compounds to ameliorate osteopenic disorders of bone.",,
9062193,Crystal structure of the type-I interleukin-1 receptor complexed with interleukin-1beta.,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important mediator of inflammatory disease. The IL-1 family currently consists of two agonists, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, and one antagonist, IL-1ra. Each of these molecules binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL1R). The binding of IL-1alpha or IL-1beta to IL1R is an early step in IL-1 signal transduction and blocking this interaction may therefore be a useful target for the development of new drugs. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of IL-1beta bound to the extracellular domain of IL1R (s-IL1R) at 2.5 A resolution. IL-1beta binds to s-IL1R with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure shows that s-IL1R consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains which wrap around IL-1beta in a manner distinct from the structures of previously described cytokine-receptor complexes. The two receptor-binding regions on IL-1beta identified by site-directed mutagenesis both contact the receptor: one binds to the first two domains of the receptor, while the other binds exclusively to the third domain.",,
18606138,Cthrc1 selectively activates the planar cell polarity pathway of Wnt signaling by stabilizing the Wnt-receptor complex.,"Vertebrate Wnt proteins activate several distinct pathways. Intrinsic differences among Wnt ligands and Frizzled (Fzd) receptors, and the availability of pathway-specific coreceptors, LRP5/6, and Ror2, affect pathway selection. Here, we show that a secreted glycoprotein, Cthrc1, is involved in selective activation of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway by Wnt proteins. Although Cthrc1 null mutant mice appeared normal, the introduction of a heterozygous mutation of a PCP gene, Vangl2, resulted in abnormalities characteristic of PCP mutants. In HEK293T cells, Cthrc1 activated the PCP pathway but suppressed the canonical pathway. Cell-surface-anchored Cthrc1 bound to Wnt proteins, Fzd proteins, and Ror2 and enhanced the interaction of Wnt proteins and Fzd/Ror2 by forming the Cthrc1-Wnt-Fzd/Ror2 complex. Consistent with this, Ror2 mutant mice also showed PCP-related abnormalities in the inner ear. These results suggest that Cthrc1 is a Wnt cofactor protein that selectively activates the Wnt/PCP pathway by stabilizing ligand-receptor interaction.",Developmental cell,2008

17182537,Cutting Edge: Allele-specific and peptide-dependent interactions between KIR3DL1 and HLA-A and HLA-B.,"Although it is clear that KIR3DL1 recognizes Bw4(+) HLA-B, the role of Bw4(+) HLA-A allotypes as KIR3DL1 ligands is controversial. We therefore examined the binding of tetrameric HLA-A and -B complexes, including HLA*2402, a common Bw4(+) HLA-A allotype, to KIR3DL1*001, *005, *007, and *1502 allotypes. Only Bw4(+) tetramers bound KIR3DL1. Three of four HLA-A*2402 tetramers bound one or more KIR3DL1 allotypes and all four KIR3DL1 allotypes bound to one or more HLA-A*2402 tetramers, but with different binding specificities. Only KIR3DL1*005 bound both HLA-A*2402 and HLA-B*5703 tetramers. HLA-A*2402-expressing target cells were resistant to lysis by NK cells expressing KIR3DL1*001 or *005. This study shows that HLA-A*2402 is a ligand for KIR3DL1 and demonstrates how the binding of KIR3DL1 to Bw4(+) ligands depends upon the bound peptide as well as HLA and KIR3DL1 polymorphism.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2007
11238599,Cutting edge: CD43 functions as a T cell counterreceptor for the macrophage adhesion receptor sialoadhesin (Siglec-1).,"Sialoadhesin (Siglec-1) is a macrophage-restricted sialic acid-binding receptor that mediates interactions with hemopoietic cells, including lymphocytes. In this study, we identify sialoadhesin counterreceptors on T lymphocytes. Several major glycoproteins (85, 130, 240 kDa) were precipitated by sialoadhesin-Fc fusion proteins from a murine T cell line (TK-1). Binding of sialoadhesin to these glycoproteins was sialic acid dependent and was abolished by mutation of a critical residue (R97A) of the sialic acid binding site in the membrane distal Ig-like domain of sialoadhesin. The 130- and 240-kDa sialoadhesin-binding glycoproteins were identified as the sialomucins CD43 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (CD162), respectively. CD43 expressed in COS cells supported increased binding to immobilized sialoadhesin. Finally, sialoadhesin bound different glycoforms of CD43 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, including unbranched (core 1) and branched (core 2) O:-linked glycans, that are normally found on CD43 in resting and activated T cells, respectively. These results identify CD43 as a T cell counterreceptor for sialoadhesin and suggest that in addition to its anti-adhesive role CD43 may promote cell-cell interactions.",,
15034010,Cutting edge: CD96 (tactile) promotes NK cell-target cell adhesion by interacting with the poliovirus receptor (CD155).,"The poliovirus receptor (PVR) belongs to a large family of Ig molecules called nectins and nectin-like proteins, which mediate cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, and serve as entry receptors for viruses. It has been recently shown that human NK cells recognize PVR through the receptor DNAM-1, which triggers NK cell stimulation in association with beta(2) integrin. In this study, we show that NK cells recognize PVR through an additional receptor, CD96, or T cell-activated increased late expression (Tactile). CD96 promotes NK cell adhesion to target cells expressing PVR, stimulates cytotoxicity of activated NK cells, and mediates acquisition of PVR from target cells. Thus, NK cells have evolved a dual receptor system that recognizes nectins and nectin-like molecules on target cells and mediates NK cell adhesion and triggering of effector functions. As PVR is highly expressed in certain tumors, this receptor system may be critical for NK cell recognition of tumors.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2004
10706668,"Cutting edge: identification of a novel chemokine receptor that binds dendritic cell- and T cell-active chemokines including ELC, SLC, and TECK.","Searching for new receptors of dendritic cell- and T cell-active chemokines, we used a combination of techniques to interrogate orphan chemokine receptors. We report here on human CCX CKR, previously represented only by noncontiguous expressed sequence tags homologous to bovine PPR1, a putative gustatory receptor. We employed a two-tiered process of ligand assignment, where immobilized chemokines constructed on stalks (stalkokines) were used as bait for adhesion of cells expressing CCX CKR. These cells adhered to stalkokines representing ELC, a chemokine previously thought to bind only CCR7. Adhesion was abolished in the presence of soluble ELC, SLC (CCR7 ligands), and TECK (a CCR9 ligand). Complete ligand profiles were further determined by radiolabeled ligand binding and competition with >80 chemokines. ELC, SLC, and TECK comprised high affinity ligands (IC50 <15 nM); lower affinity ligands include BLC and vMIP-II (IC50 <150 nM). With its high affinity for CC chemokines and homology to CC receptors, we provisionally designate this new receptor CCR10.",,
25595774,Cutting Edge: identification of neutrophil PGLYRP1 as a ligand for TREM-1.,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 is an orphan receptor implicated in innate immune activation. Inhibition of TREM-1 reduces sepsis in mouse models, suggesting a role for it in immune responses triggered by bacteria. However, the absence of an identified ligand has hampered a full understanding of TREM-1 function. We identified complexes between peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1) and bacterially derived peptidoglycan that constitute a potent ligand capable of binding TREM-1 and inducing known TREM-1 functions. Interestingly, multimerization of PGLYRP1 bypassed the need for peptidoglycan in TREM-1 activation, demonstrating that the PGLYRP1/TREM-1 axis can be activated in the absence of bacterial products. The role for PGLYRP1 as a TREM-1 activator provides a new mechanism by which bacteria can trigger myeloid cells, linking two known, but previously unrelated, pathways in innate immunity.",,
10229797,"Cutting edge: identification of the orphan chemokine receptor GPR-9-6 as CCR9, the receptor for the chemokine TECK.","Thymus-expressed chemokine (TECK) has been reported to chemoattract dendritic cells, thymocytes, and activated macrophages. Here, we show that TECK is a specific agonist for a human orphan receptor called GPR-9-6. We have determined the cDNA sequence of human GPR-9-6 and cloned the corresponding murine cDNA. Human and murine GPR-9-6 expression is very high in the thymus and low in lymph nodes and spleen. RT-PCR analysis of murine GPR-9-6 expression on murine FACS-sorted thymocyte subpopulations showed that this gene is expressed in both immature and mature T cells. Additions of human or murine TECK to HEK 293/human GPR-9-6 and HEK 293/murine GPR-9-6 transfectants provoked intracytoplasmic calcium mobilization. Human TECK also induced the in vitro migration of HEK 293/human GPR-9-6 cells. These results confirm that GPR-9-6 is a specific receptor for TECK.

One previously reported orphan receptor is an incomplete PCR clone, called GPR2. Here we report the cloning of full-length human (h)GPR2 and mouse (m)GPR2 cDNAs, and the identification of GPR2 as a receptor for a novel CC chemokine called ESkine. hGPR2 is expressed at high levels in testis and small intestine, and at lower levels in other tissues. mGPR2 was expressed at high levels in small intestine, colon, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches and at lower levels in thymus and spleen. Stimulation of L1.2/hGPR2 transfectants with hESkine induced their migration and resulted in intracellular calcium mobilization. These results provide evidence that GPR2 is a specific receptor for ESkine. We propose that GPR2 be renamed as CCR10. The expression pattern of mGPR2/CCR10 suggests that it may play a role in the homing/trafficking of leukocytes within intestinal and lymphoid environments.",,
14764663,Cutting edge: IL-26 signals through a novel receptor complex composed of IL-20 receptor 1 and IL-10 receptor 2.,"The receptor for IL-26 (AK155), a cytokine of the IL-10 family, has not previously been defined. We demonstrate that the active receptor complex for IL-26 is a heterodimer composed of two receptor proteins: IL-20R1 and IL-10R2. Signaling through the IL-26R results in activation of STAT1 and STAT3 which can be blocked by neutralizing Abs against IL-20R1 or IL-10R2. IL-10R2 is broadly expressed on a wide variety of tissues, whereas only a limited number of tissues express IL-20R1. Therefore, the ability to respond to IL-26 is restricted by the expression of IL-20R1. IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, and IL-24 fail to signal through the combination of IL-10R2 and IL-20R1 proteins, demonstrating that this receptor combination is unique and specific for IL-26.",,
15153464,Cutting edge: NTB-A activates NK cells via homophilic interaction.,"NK cells are an important component of the innate immune system. Their activity is tightly regulated by activating and inhibitory surface receptors. However, the exact functions of many activating surface receptors, as well as their ligands, still remain to be elucidated. NTB-A is a receptor on the surfaces of human NK, T, and B cells, mediating a signal whose malfunction may be involved in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease. However, the ligand of NTB-A has remained elusive so far. Using trimeric recombinant proteins, we now show that NTB-A is its own ligand. Homophilic interaction of NTB-A enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and influences NK cell proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion. We suggest that NTB-A is an interlymphocyte signaling molecule, which serves to orchestrate the activities of immune cells.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2004
11564763,"Cutting edge: STAT activation by IL-19, IL-20 and mda-7 through IL-20 receptor complexes of two types.","IL-10-related cytokines include IL-20 and IL-22, which induce, respectively, keratinocyte proliferation and acute phase production by hepatocytes, as well as IL-19, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 7, and AK155, three cytokines for which no activity nor receptor complex has been described thus far. Here, we show that mda-7 and IL-19 bind to the previously described IL-20R complex, composed by cytokine receptor family 2-8/IL-20Ralpha and DIRS1/IL-20Rbeta (type I IL-20R). In addition, mda-7 and IL-20, but not IL-19, bind to another receptor complex, composed by IL-22R and DIRS1/IL20Rbeta (type II IL-20R). In both cases, binding of the ligands results in STAT3 phosphorylation and activation of a minimal promoter including STAT-binding sites. Taken together, these results demonstrate that: 1) IL-20 induces STAT activation through IL-20R complexes of two types; 2) mda-7 and IL-20 redundantly signal through both complexes; and 3) IL-19 signals only through the type I IL-20R complex.",,
11418623,Cutting edge: the common gamma-chain is an indispensable subunit of the IL-21 receptor complex.,"The common gamma-chain (gamma(c)) is an indispensable subunit of the functional receptor complexes for IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 as well as IL-2. Here we show that the gamma(c) is also shared with the IL-21R complex. Although IL-21 binds to the IL-21R expressed on gamma(c)-deficient ED40515(-) cells, IL-21 is unable to transduce any intracytoplasmic signals. However, in EDgamma-16 cells, a gamma(c)-transfected ED40515(-) cell line, IL-21 binds to the IL-21R and can activate Janus kinase (JAK)1, JAK3, STAT1, and STAT3. The chemical cross-linking study reveals the direct binding of IL-21 to the gamma(c). These data clearly demonstrate that the gamma(c) is an indispensable subunit of the functional IL-21R complex.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2001
10725697,"Cutting edge: the orphan chemokine receptor G protein-coupled receptor-2 (GPR-2, CCR10) binds the skin-associated chemokine CCL27 (CTACK/ALP/ILC).","We recently reported the identification of a chemokine (CTACK), which has been renamed CCL27 according to a new systematic chemokine nomenclature. We report that CCL27 binds the previously orphan chemokine receptor GPR-2, as detected by calcium flux and chemotactic responses of GPR-2 transfectants. We renamed this receptor CCR10. Because of the skin-associated expression pattern of CCL27, we focused on the expression of CCL27 and CCR10 in normal skin compared with inflammatory and autoimmune skin diseases. CCL27 is constitutively produced by keratinocytes but can also be induced upon stimulation with TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. CCR10 is not expressed by keratinocytes and is instead expressed by melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and dermal microvascular endothelial cells. CCR10 was also detected in T cells as well as in skin-derived Langerhans cells. Taken together, these observations suggest a role for this novel ligand/receptor pair in both skin homeostasis as well as a potential role in inflammatory responses.",,
18566366,Cutting edge: TLR2 is a functional receptor for acute-phase serum amyloid A.,"Induced secretion of acute-phase serum amyloid A (SAA) is a host response to danger signals and a clinical indication of inflammation. The biological functions of SAA in inflammation have not been fully defined, although recent reports indicate that SAA induces proinflammatory cytokine expression. We now show that TLR2 is a functional receptor for SAA. HeLa cells expressing TLR2 responded to SAA with potent activation of NF-kappaB, which was enhanced by TLR1 expression and blocked by the Toll/IL-1 receptor/resistance (TIR) deletion mutants of TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6. SAA stimulation led to increased phosphorylation of MAPKs and accelerated IkappaBalpha degradation in TLR2-HeLa cells, and results from a solid-phase binding assay showed SAA interaction with the ectodomain of TLR2. Selective reduction of SAA-induced gene expression was observed in tlr2-/- mouse macrophages compared with wild-type cells. These results suggest a potential role for SAA in inflammatory diseases through activation of TLR2.",,
8550564,CXC chemokines bind to unique sets of selectivity determinants that can function independently and are broadly distributed on multiple domains of human interleukin-8 receptor B. Determinants of high affinity binding and receptor activation are distinct.,"Human interleukin-8 receptors A (IL-8RA) and B (IL-8RB) are seven-transmembrane domain (TMD) neutrophil chemokine receptors with similar sequences (77% amino acid identity) and similar G protein selectivity, but markedly different selectivity for CXC chemokines. IL-8RB is selective for IL-8, growth-related oncogene alpha (GRO alpha) and neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2), whereas IL-8RA is selective only for IL-8. To identify selectivity determinants, we made eight chimeric receptors exchanging: 1) the three main regions of sequence divergence between IL-8RA and IL-8RB (the N-terminal segment before TMD1, the region from TMD4 to the end of the second extracellular (e2) loop, and the C-terminal tail), and 2) the N-terminal segment of CC chemokine receptor 1, which does not bind CXC chemokines. Chimeras were tested by direct 125I-IL-8, 125I-GRO alpha, and 125I-NAP-2 binding, heterologous competition binding, and calcium flux assays using human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with receptor DNAs. The following results were obtained: 1) chimeric receptors had binding sites for IL-8, GRO alpha and NAP-2 distinct from those on IL-8RA and IL-8RB; 2) IL-8, GRO alpha and NAP-2 bound to overlapping but distinct sites that mapped differentially to multiple domains on IL-8RB; 3) high affinity radioligand binding and high agonist potency were separable functions for IL-8, GRO alpha and NAP-2, suggesting that the determinants of high affinity binding may not be critical for receptor activation; and 4) determinants of GRO alpha and NAP-2 selectivity were found in both the N-terminal segment before TMD1 and the region from TMD4 to the end of the e2 loop of IL-8RB, and functioned independently of each other. Stated reciprocally, the N-terminal segment of IL-8RA was not a dominant selectivity determinant. These data suggest that both narrow and broad spectrum chemokine antagonists can be developed to block functions mediated by IL-8RB.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
33801414,CXCL10 Is an Agonist of the CC Family Chemokine Scavenger Receptor ACKR2/D6.,"Atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) are important regulators of chemokine functions. Among them, the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2 (also known as D6) has long been considered as a scavenger of inflammatory chemokines exclusively from the CC family. In this study, by using highly sensitive β-arrestin recruitment assays based on NanoBiT and NanoBRET technologies, we identified the inflammatory CXC chemokine CXCL10 as a new strong agonist ligand for ACKR2. CXCL10 is known to play an important role in the infiltration of immune cells into the tumour bed and was previously reported to bind to CXCR3 only. We demonstrated that ACKR2 is able to internalize and reduce the availability of CXCL10 in the extracellular space. Moreover, we found that, in contrast to CC chemokines, CXCL10 activity towards ACKR2 was drastically reduced by the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) N-terminal processing, pointing to a different receptor binding pocket occupancy by CC and CXC chemokines. Overall, our study sheds new light on the complexity of the chemokine network and the potential role of CXCL10 regulation by ACKR2 in many physiological and pathological processes, including tumour immunology. Our data also testify that systematic reassessment of chemokine-receptor pairing is critically needed as important interactions may remain unexplored.",Cancers,2021
14625285,"CXCL16 signals via Gi, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, I kappa B kinase, and nuclear factor-kappa B and induces cell-cell adhesion and aortic smooth muscle cell proliferation.","CXCL16, a recently discovered transmembrane chemokine, is expressed in human aortic smooth muscle cell (ASMC). It facilitates uptake of low density lipoproteins by macrophages, resulting in foam cell formation. However, it is not known whether ASMC express CXCR6, the receptor for CXCL16, or whether CXCL16 affects ASMC biology. To dissect the biological and signal transduction pathways elicited by CXCL16, human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were treated with pharmacological inhibitors or transiently transfected with pathway-specific dominant-negative or kinase-dead expression vectors prior to the addition of CXCL16. HASMC expressed CXCR6 at basal conditions. Exposure of HASMC to CXCL16 increased NF-kappa B DNA binding activity, induced kappa B-driven luciferase activity, and up-regulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in an NF-kappa B-dependent manner. However, treatment with pertussis toxin (G(i) inhibitor), wortmannin or LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K inhibitors)), or Akt inhibitor or overexpression of dominant-negative (dn) PI3K gamma, dnPDK-1, kinase-dead (kd) Akt, kdIKK-beta, dnIKK-gamma, dnI kappa B-alpha, or dnI kappa B-beta significantly attenuated CXCL16-induced NF-kappa B activation. Furthermore, CXCL16 increased cell-cell adhesion and induced cellular proliferation in an NF-kappa B-dependent manner. In conclusion, CXCL16 is a potent and direct activator of NF-kappaB and induces kappa B-dependent proinflammatory gene transcription. CXCL16-mediated NF-kappa B activation occurred via heterotrimeric G proteins, PI3K, PDK-1, Akt, and I kappa B kinase (IKK). CXCL16 induced I kappa B phosphorylation and degradation. Most importantly, CXCL16 increased cell-cell adhesion and induced kappa B-dependent ASMC proliferation, indicating that CXCL16 may play an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease.",,
38502733,CXCL17 is an allosteric inhibitor of CXCR4 through a mechanism of action involving glycosaminoglycans.,"CXCL17 is a chemokine principally expressed by mucosal tissues, where it facilitates chemotaxis of monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages and has antimicrobial properties. CXCL17 is also implicated in the pathology of inflammatory disorders and progression of several cancers, and its expression is increased during viral infections of the lung. However, the exact role of CXCL17 in health and disease requires further investigation, and there is a need for confirmed molecular targets mediating CXCL17 functional responses. Using a range of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based assays, here we demonstrated that CXCL17 inhibited CXCR4-mediated signaling and ligand binding. Moreover, CXCL17 interacted with neuropillin-1, a VEGFR2 coreceptor. In addition, we found that CXCL17 only inhibited CXCR4 ligand binding in intact cells and demonstrated that this effect was mimicked by known glycosaminoglycan binders, surfen and protamine sulfate. Disruption of putative GAG binding domains in CXCL17 prevented CXCR4 binding. This indicated that CXCL17 inhibited CXCR4 by a mechanism of action that potentially required the presence of a glycosaminoglycan-containing accessory protein. Together, our results revealed that CXCL17 is an endogenous inhibitor of CXCR4 and represents the next step in our understanding of the function of CXCL17 and regulation of CXCR4 signaling.",Science signaling,2024
12571234,CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of the chemokine IP-10 (CXCL10).,"The chemokine IP-10 (interferon-inducible protein of 10 kDa, CXCL10) binds the G protein-coupled receptor CXCR3, which is found mainly on activated T cells and NK cells, and plays an important role in Th1-type inflammatory diseases. IP-10 also binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), an interaction thought to be important for its sequestration on endothelial and other cells. In this study, we performed an extensive mutational analysis to identify the CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of murine IP-10. The mutants were characterized for heparin binding, CXCR3 binding, and the ability to induce chemotaxis, Ca(2+) flux, and CXCR3 internalization. Double mutations neutralizing adjacent basic residues at the C terminus did not lead to a significant reduction in heparin binding, indicating that the main heparin binding site of IP-10 is not along the C-terminal alpha helix. Alanine exchange of Arg-22 had the largest effect on heparin binding, with residues Arg-20, Ile-24, Lys-26, Lys-46, and Lys-47 further contributing to heparin binding. A charge change mutation of Arg-22 resulted in further reduction in heparin binding. The N-terminal residue Arg-8, preceding the first cysteine, was critical for CXCR3 signaling. Mutations of charged and uncharged residues in the loop regions of residues 20-24 and 46-47, which caused reduced heparin binding, also resulted in reduced CXCR3 binding and signaling. CXCR3 expressing GAG-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed that GAG binding was not required for IP-10 binding and signaling through CXCR3, which suggests that the CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of IP-10 are partially overlapping.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
26780310,CXCR4 and CXCR7 Mediate TFF3-Induced Cell Migration Independently From the ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway.,"Trefoil factor family (TFF) peptides, and in particular TFF3, are characteristic secretory products of mucous epithelia that promote antiapoptosis, epithelial migration, restitution, and wound healing. For a long time, a receptor for TFF3 had not yet been identified. However, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been described as a low affinity receptor for TFF2. Additionally, CXCR7, which is able to heterodimerize with CXCR4, has also been discussed as a potential TFF2 receptor. Since there are distinct structural similarities between the three known TFF peptides, this study evaluated whether CXCR4 and CXCR7 may also act as putative TFF3 receptors.",,
11287419,"CYR61 stimulates human skin fibroblast migration through Integrin alpha vbeta 5 and enhances mitogenesis through integrin alpha vbeta 3, independent of its carboxyl-terminal domain.","CYR61, an angiogenic factor and a member of the CCN protein family, is an extracellular matrix-associated, heparin-binding protein that mediates cell adhesion, promotes cell migration, and enhances growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation. CYR61 induces angiogenesis and promotes tumor growth in vivo and is expressed in dermal fibroblasts during cutaneous wound healing. It has been demonstrated recently that adhesion of primary skin fibroblasts to CYR61 is mediated through integrin alpha(6)beta(1) and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, resulting in adhesive signaling and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3. CYR61 is composed of four discrete structural domains that bear sequence similarities to the insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, von Willebrand factor type C repeat, thrombospondin type 1 repeat, and a carboxyl-terminal (CT) domain that resembles cysteine knots found in some growth factors. In this study, we show that a CYR61 mutant (CYR61DeltaCT) that has the CT domain deleted is unable to support adhesion of primary human skin fibroblasts but is still able to stimulate chemotaxis and enhance basic fibroblast growth factor-induced mitogenesis similar to wild type. In addition, fibroblast migration to CYR61 is mediated through integrin alpha(v)beta(5) but not integrins alpha(6)beta(1) or alpha(v)beta(3). Furthermore, we show that CYR61 binds directly to purified integrin alpha(v)beta(5) in vitro. By contrast, CYR61 enhancement of basic fibroblast growth factor-induced DNA synthesis is mediated through integrin alpha(v)beta(3), a known receptor for CYR61 that mediates CYR61-dependent cell adhesion and chemotaxis in vascular endothelial cells. Thus, CYR61 promotes primary human fibroblast adhesion, migration, and mitogenesis through integrins alpha(6)beta(1), alpha(v)beta(5), and alpha(v)beta(3), respectively. Together, these findings establish CYR61 as a novel ligand for integrin alpha(v)beta(5) and show that CYR61 interacts with distinct integrins to mediate disparate activities in a cell type-specific manner.",,
10395410,Cysteine residues in a synthetic peptide corresponding to human follicle-stimulating hormone beta-subunit receptor-binding domain 81-95 [hFSH-beta-(81-95)] modulate the in vivo effects of hFSH-beta-(81-95) on the mouse estrous cycle.,"We have previously reported that synthetic peptide amides corresponding to subdomains of the human FSH 3-subunit, hFSH-beta-(33--53) and hFSH-beta-(81--95), interact with the external domain of the FSH receptor in two in vitro model systems. Consistent with these in vitro observations, we found that intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of each of these peptides prolonged vaginal estrus in normally cycling mice in vivo. Both hFSH-beta-(33--53) and hFSH-beta-(81--95) contain cysteine (Cys) residues with free sulfhydryl groups of potential significance in receptor interactions. To assess the possible involvement of these groups in the in vivo effects of hFSH-beta-(33--53) and hFSH-beta-(81--95), synthetic peptide analogs were prepared in which all Cys residues were replaced with serine (Ser). In the present study, we demonstrate that the in vivo effect of hFSH-beta-(33--53) on the mouse estrous cycle, extension of vaginal estrus, was not changed by substitution of Cys-51 with Ser. In contrast, mice receiving the Ser-substituted analog of hFSH-beta-(81--95) had normal estrus stages, but were arrested in diestrus. hFSH-beta-(33--53)-(81--95), a linear peptide encompassing both domains, also prolonged vaginal estrus. The Ser-substituted analog of this peptide, however, prolonged vaginal estrus in some of the mice tested and induced cycle arrest at diestrus in others. hFSH-beta-(90--95), the active subdomain at the C-terminus of hFSH-beta-(81--95), extended vaginal estrus, but diestrus stages were of normal duration. Its Ser-substituted analog, however, prolonged the estrus stage of the majority of mice treated, but induced diestrus arrest in some. The differing responses to these peptides are presumably due to interactions of the synthetic peptides with different regions of the FSH receptor. This further suggests that one consequence of ligand interaction with multiple receptor binding domains may be variable effects on ovarian function, and that Cys to Ser analogs may have value in the design of a novel class of synthetic peptides capable of fertility regulation and control.",Regulatory peptides,1999

The immunobiological functions of CYTL1 remain largely unknown, and its potential receptor(s) has not been identified. A previous proposed hypothesis suggested that CYTL1 had structural similarities with CCL2 and that CCR2 was a potential receptor of CYTL1. In this study, we verify that CYTL1 possesses chemotactic activity and demonstrate that its functional receptor is CCR2B using a series of experiments performed in HEK293 cells expressing CCR2B or CCR2B-EGFP, including chemotaxis, receptor internalization, and radioactive binding assays. CYTL1 chemoattracts human monocytes but not PBLs, and its chemotactic activity toward monocytes is dependent on the CCR2B-ERK pathway. Furthermore, both human and mouse recombinant CYTL1 protein have chemotactic effects on macrophages from wild-type mice but not from Ccr2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, the chemotactic activity of CYTL1 is sensitive to pertussis toxin. All of the above data confirm that CCR2B is a functional receptor of CYTL1.",,
12105206,"Decorin binds to a narrow region of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, partially overlapping but distinct from the EGF-binding epitope.","Decorin, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, is a key regulator of tumor growth by acting as an antagonist of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. To search for cell surface receptors interacting with decorin, we generated a decorin/alkaline phosphatase chimeric protein and used it to screen a cDNA library by expression cloning. We identified two strongly reactive clones that encoded either the full-length EGFR or its ectodomain. A physiologically relevant interaction between decorin and EGFR was confirmed in the yeast two-hybrid system and further validated by experiments using EGF/EGFR interaction and transient cell transfection assays. Using a panel of deletion mutants, decorin binding was mapped to a narrow region of the EGFR within its ligand-binding L2 domain. Moreover, the central leucine-rich repeat 6 of decorin was required for interaction with the EGFR. Site-directed mutagenesis of the EGFR L2 domain showed that a cluster of residues, His(394)-Ile(402), was essential for both decorin and EGF binding. In contrast, K465, previously shown to be cross-linked to epidermal growth factor (EGF), was required for EGF but not for decorin binding. Thus, decorin binds to a discrete region of the EGFR, partially overlapping with but distinct from the EGF-binding domain. These findings could lead to the generation of protein mimetics capable of suppressing EGFR function.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
9988678,Decorin is a biological ligand for the epidermal growth factor receptor.,"Ectopic expression of decorin induces profound cytostatic effects in transformed cells with diverse histogenetic backgrounds. The mechanism of action has only recently begun to be elucidated. Exogenous decorin activates the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, thereby triggering a signaling cascade that leads to phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, induction of p21, and growth suppression. In this study we demonstrate a direct interaction of decorin with the EGF receptor. Binding of decorin induces dimerization of the EGF receptor and rapid and sustained phosphorylation of MAP kinase in squamous carcinoma cells. In a cell-free system, decorin induces autophosphorylation of purified EGF receptor by activating the receptor tyrosine kinase and can also act as a substrate for the EGF receptor kinase itself. Using radioligand binding assays we show that both immobilized and soluble decorin bind to the EGF receptor ectodomain or to purified EGF receptor. The binding is mediated by the protein core and has relatively low affinity (Kd approximately 87 nM). Thus, decorin should be considered as a novel biological ligand for the EGF receptor, an interaction that could regulate cell growth during remodeling and cancer growth.",,
21059704,Defective gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuron migration in mice lacking SEMA3A signalling through NRP1 and NRP2: implications for the aetiology of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.,"Kallmann syndrome (KS) is a genetic disease characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and impaired sense of smell. The genetic causes underlying this syndrome are still largely unknown, but are thought to be due to a developmental defect in the migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Understanding the causes of the disease is hampered by lack of appropriate mouse models. GnRH neurons are hypothalamic cells that centrally control reproduction in mammals by secreting the GnRH decapeptide into the portal blood vessels of the pituitary to stimulate the production of gonadotropins. During development, these cells are born in the nasal placode outside the brain and migrate in association with olfactory/vomeronasal axons to reach the forebrain and position themselves in the hypothalamus. By combining the analysis of genetically altered mice with in vitro models, we demonstrate here that a secreted guidance cue of the class 3 semaphorin family, SEMA3A, is essential for the development of the GnRH neuron system: loss of SEMA3A signalling alters the targeting of vomeronasal nerves and the migration of GnRH neurons into the brain, resulting in reduced gonadal size. We found that SEMA3A signals redundantly through both its classical receptors neuropilin (NRP) 1 and, unconventionally, NRP2, while the usual NRP2 ligand SEMA3F is dispensable for this process. Strikingly, mice lacking SEMA3A or semaphorin signalling through both NRP1 and NRP2 recapitulate the anatomical features of a single case of KS analysed so far, and may therefore be used as genetic models to elucidate the pathogenesis of KS.",,

Our predicted results using an in silico simulation model of dendritic cells and our observed results in human myeloid dendritic cells, show that DEFB103 significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced 6 responses, attenuated 7 responses, and both enhanced/attenuated the CXCL1 and TNF responses to Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin B (HagB). In murine JAWSII dendritic cells, DEFB103 significantly attenuated, yet rarely enhanced, the Cxcl2, Il6, and Csf3 responses to HagB; and in C57/BL6 mice, DEFB103 significantly enhanced, yet rarely attenuated, the Cxcl1, Csf1, and Csf3 responses. Thus, DEFB103 influences pro-inflammatory activities with the concentration of DEFB103 and order of timing of DEFB103 exposure to dendritic cells, with respect to microbial antigen exposure to cells, being paramount in orchestrating the onset, magnitude, and composition of the chemokine and cytokine response.",,

9211865,Defining the topology of integrin alpha5beta1-fibronectin interactions using inhibitory anti-alpha5 and anti-beta1 monoclonal antibodies. Evidence that the synergy sequence of fibronectin is recognized by the amino-terminal repeats of the alpha5 subunit.,"The high affinity interaction of integrin alpha5beta1 with the central cell binding domain (CCBD) of fibronectin requires both the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence (in the 10th type III repeat) and a second site (in the adjacent 9th type III repeat) which synergizes with RGD. We have attempted to map the fibronectin binding interface on alpha5beta1 using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit ligand recognition. The binding of two anti-alpha5 mAbs (P1D6 and JBS5) to alpha5beta1 was strongly inhibited by a tryptic CCBD fragment of fibronectin (containing both synergy sequence and RGD) but not by GRGDS peptide. Using recombinant wild type and mutated fragments of the CCBD, we show that the synergy region of the 9th type III repeat is involved in blocking the binding of P1D6 and JBS5 to alpha5beta1. In contrast, binding of the anti-beta1 mAb P4C10 to alpha5beta1 was inhibited to a similar extent by GRGDS peptide, the tryptic CCBD fragment, or recombinant proteins lacking the synergy region, indicating that the RGD sequence is involved in blocking P4C10 binding. P1D6 inhibited the interaction of a wild type CCBD fragment with alpha5beta1 but had no effect on the binding of a mutant fragment that lacked the synergy region. The epitopes of P1D6 and JBS5 mapped to the NH2-terminal repeats of the alpha5 subunit. Our results indicate that the synergy region is recognized primarily by the alpha5 subunit (in particular by its NH2-terminal repeats) but that the beta1 subunit plays the major role in binding of the RGD sequence. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms, specificity, and topology of integrin-ligand interactions.",,

The identity of the amino acid residues on the KIR molecule important for binding to the HLA protein is not well understood; although some KIR2D residues involved in HLA-C recognition have been identified, their relative importance and whether other amino acids contribute to binding was unclear. This novel system was used to study, by site-directed mutagenesis, the role of various amino acids in KIR binding to HLA-C ligand. The data presented here show that while multiple polymorphic residues contribute to the HLA-C binding site on KIR proteins, two clusters of polymorphic residues define the group allotype specificity of HLA-C binding to a KIR2D molecule.",,
10504396,Definition of receptor binding sites on human interleukin-11 by molecular modeling-guided mutagenesis.,"Interleukin-11 (IL-11) belongs to the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-type subfamily of long-chain helical cytokines including IL-6, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M, and cardiotrophin-1, which all share the glycoprotein gp130 as a signal transducing receptor component. IL-11 acts on cells expressing gp130 and the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) alpha-subunit (IL-11Ralpha). The structural epitopes of IL-11 required for the recruitment of the individual receptor subunits have not yet been defined. Based on the structure of CNTF, a three-dimensional model of human IL-11 was built. Using this model, 10 surface exposed amino acid residues of IL-11 were selected for mutagenesis using analogies to the well-characterized receptor recruitment sites of IL-6, CNTF, and LIF. The respective mutants of human IL-11 were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in bacteria. Their biological activities were determined on HepG2 and Ba/F3-130-11alpha cells. Several mutants with substantially decreased bioactivity and one hyperagonistic mutant were identified and further analyzed with regard to recruitment of IL-11Ralpha and gp130. The low-activity mutant I171D still binds IL-11Ralpha but fails to recruit gp130, whereas the hyperagonistic variant R135E more efficiently engages the IL-11R subunits. The low-activity mutants R190E and L194D failed to bind to IL-11Ralpha. These findings reveal a common mechanism of receptor recruitment in the family of IL-6-type cytokines and offer considerable perspectives for the rational design of IL-11 antagonists and hyperagonists.",European journal of biochemistry,1999
8861902,Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) encodes a netrin receptor.,"The guidance of developing axons in the nervous system is mediated partly by diffusible chemoattractants secreted by axonal target cells. Netrins are chemoattractants for commissural axons in the vertebrate spinal cord, but the mechanisms through which they produce their effects are unknown. We show that Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC), a transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is expressed on spinal commissural axons and possesses netrin-1-binding activity. Moreover, an antibody to DCC selectively blocks the netrin-1-dependent outgrowth of commissural axons in vitro. These results indicate that DCC is a receptor or a component of a receptor that mediates the effects of netrin-1 on commissural axons, and they complement genetic evidence for interactions between DCC and netrin homologs in C. elegans and Drosophila.",Cell,1996
9525885,Deletions in the third intracellular loop of the thyrotropin receptor. A new mechanism for constitutive activation.,"Gain-of-function mutations of the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) gene have been invoked as one of the major causes of toxic thyroid adenomas. In a toxic thyroid nodule, we recently identified a 9-amino acid deletion (amino acid positions 613-621) within the third intracellular (i3) loop of the TSHR resulting in constitutive receptor activity. This finding exemplifies a new mechanism of TSHR activation and raises new questions concerning the function of the i3 loop. Because the i3 loop is thought to be critical for receptor/G protein interaction in many receptors, we systematically reexamined the role of the TSHR's i3 loop for G protein coupling. Thus, various deletion mutants were generated and functionally characterized. We identified an optimal deletion length responsible for constitutive activity. If the number of deleted amino acids was reduced, elevated basal cAMP accumulation was found to be concomitantly diminished. Expansion of the deletion dramatically impaired cell surface expression of the receptor. Shifting the deletion toward the N terminus of the i3 loop resulted in unaltered strong constitutive receptor activity. In contrast, translocation of the deletion toward the C terminus led to significantly reduced basal cAMP formation, most probably due to destruction of a conserved cluster of amino acids. In this study, we show for the first time that amino acid deletions within the i3 loop of a G protein-coupled receptor result in constitutive receptor activity. In the TSHR, 75% of the i3 loop generally assumed to play an essential role in G protein coupling can be deleted without rendering the mutant receptor unresponsive to thyrotropin. These findings support a novel model explaining the molecular events accompanying receptor activation by agonist.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
8617199,Delineation of the peptide binding site of the human galanin receptor.,"Galanin, a neuroendocrine peptide of 29 amino acids, binds to Gi/Go-coupled receptors to trigger cellular responses. To determine which amino acids of the recently cloned seven-transmembrane domain-type human galanin receptor are involved in the high-affinity binding of the endogenous peptide ligand, we performed a mutagenesis study. Mutation of the His264 or His267 of transmembrane domain VI to alanine, or of Phe282 of transmembrane domain VII to glycine, results in an apparent loss of galanin binding. The substitution of Glu271 to serine in the extracellular loop III of the receptor causes a 12-fold loss in affinity for galanin. We combined the mutagenesis results with data on the pharmacophores (Trp2, Tyr9) of galanin and with molecular modelling of the receptor using bacteriorhodopsin as a model. Based on these studies, we propose a binding site model for the endogenous peptide ligand in the galanin receptor where the N-terminus of galanin hydrogen bonds with Glu271 of the receptor, Trp2 of galanin interacts with the Zn2+ sensitive pair of His264 and His267 of transmembrane domain VI, and Tyr9 of galanin interacts with Phe282 of transmembrane domain VII, while the C-terminus of galanin is pointing towards the N-terminus of th",The EMBO journal,1996
9819428,Delta-1 activation of notch-1 signaling results in HES-1 transactivation.,"The Notch receptor is involved in many cell fate determination events in vertebrates and invertebrates. It has been shown in Drosophila melanogaster that Delta-dependent Notch signaling activates the transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless, leading to an increased expression of the Enhancer of Split genes. Genetic evidence has also implicated the kuzbanian gene, which encodes a disintegrin metalloprotease, in the Notch signaling pathway. By using a two-cell coculture assay, we show here that vertebrate Dl-1 activates the Notch-1 cascade. Consistent with previous data obtained with active forms of Notch-1 a HES-1-derived promoter construct is transactivated in cells expressing Notch-1 in response to Dl-1 stimulation. Impairing the proteolytic maturation of the full-length receptor leads to a decrease in HES-1 transactivation, further supporting the hypothesis that only mature processed Notch is expressed at the cell surface and activated by its ligand. Furthermore, we observed that Dl-1-induced HES-1 transactivation was dependent both on Kuzbanian and RBP-J activities, consistent with the involvement of these two proteins in Notch signaling in Drosophila. We also observed that exposure of Notch-1-expressing cells to Dl-1 results in an increased level of endogenous HES-1 mRNA. Finally, coculture of Dl-1-expressing cells with myogenic C2 cells suppresses differentiation of C2 cells into myotubes, as previously demonstrated for Jagged-1 and Jagged-2, and also leads to an increased level of endogenous HES-1 mRNA. Thus, Dl-1 behaves as a functional ligand for Notch-1 and has the same ability to suppress cell differentiation as the Jagged proteins do.",,

15677347,Demonstration of a specific site of covalent labeling of the human motilin receptor using a biologically active photolabile motilin analog.,"The motilin receptor belongs to a group of class I G protein-coupled receptors that also includes the growth hormone secretagogue and ghrelin receptors. These represent clinically useful targets for pharmacotherapy. Their potentially unique structures and the molecular basis of their binding are not yet clear. We previously reported the initial affinity labeling of a region within this receptor (a cyanogen bromide fragment extending from the first to the second extracellular loop) using a position 1 photolabile motilin analog. To extend our understanding of the molecular basis of motilin binding, we have developed an additional radioiodinatable motilin analog probe having site of covalent attachment in position 5. This was a full agonist that bound to the motilin receptor specifically and with high affinity, and that efficiently established a single covalent bond to its receptor. Sequential chemical and enzymatic cleavage of labeled wild-type and mutant motilin receptor constructs established that the region of labeling was within the third extracellular loop. This was further localized to Phe(332) using radiochemical Edman degradation sequencing. These data provide the first spatial approximation constraint that can be used in the docking of this peptide ligand to its receptor. We hope that a series of such constraints can be determined to provide adequate structural information to begin to elucidate the conformation of this agonist-bound receptor and to ultimately be useful in the rational design of drugs acting at this important target.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2005
18852879,Dendritic cells release HLA-B-associated transcript-3 positive exosomes to regulate natural killer function.,"NKp30, a natural cytotoxicity receptor expressed on NK cells is critically involved in direct cytotoxicity against various tumor cells and directs both maturation and selective killing of dendritic cells. Recently the intracellular protein BAT3, which is involved in DNA damage induced apoptosis, was identified as a ligand for NKp30. However, the mechanisms underlying the exposure of the intracellular ligand BAT3 to surface NKp30 and its role in NK-DC cross talk remained elusive. Electron microscopy and flow cytometry demonstrate that exosomes released from 293T cells and iDCs express BAT3 on the surface and are recognized by NKp30-Ig. Overexpression and depletion of BAT3 in 293T cells directly correlates with the exosomal expression level and the activation of NK cell-mediated cytokine release. Furthermore, the NKp30-mediated NK/DC cross talk resulting either in iDC killing or maturation was BAT3-dependent. Taken together this puts forward a new model for the activation of NK cells through intracellular signals that are released via exosomes from accessory cells. The manipulation of the exosomal regulation may offer a novel strategy to induce tumor immunity or inhibit autoimmune diseases caused by NK cell-activation.",,
32706374,Deorphanizing FAM19A proteins as pan-neurexin ligands with an unusual biosynthetic binding mechanism.,"Neurexins are presynaptic adhesion molecules that organize synapses by binding to diverse trans-synaptic ligands, but how neurexins are regulated is incompletely understood. Here we identify FAM19A/TAFA proteins, ""orphan"" cytokines, as neurexin regulators that interact with all neurexins, except for neurexin-1γ, via an unusual mechanism. Specifically, we show that FAM19A1-A4 bind to the cysteine-loop domain of neurexins by forming intermolecular disulfide bonds during transport through the secretory pathway. FAM19A-binding required both the cysteines of the cysteine-loop domain and an adjacent sequence of neurexins. Genetic deletion of neurexins suppressed FAM19A1 expression, demonstrating that FAM19As physiologically interact with neurexins. In hippocampal cultures, expression of exogenous FAM19A1 decreased neurexin O-glycosylation and suppressed its heparan sulfate modification, suggesting that FAM19As regulate the post-translational modification of neurexins. Given the selective expression of FAM19As in specific subtypes of neurons and their activity-dependent regulation, these results suggest that FAM19As serve as cell type-specific regulators of neurexin modifications.",The Journal of cell biology,2020
20560146,Design and development of analogues of dimers of insulin-like peptide 3 B-chain as high-affinity antagonists of the RXFP2 receptor.,"Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) is one of 10 members of the human relaxin-insulin superfamily of peptides. It is a peptide hormone that is expressed by fetal and postnatal testicular Leydig cells and postnatal ovarian thecal cells. It mediates testicular descent during fetal life and suppresses sperm apoptosis in adult males, whereas, in females, it causes oocyte maturation. INSL3 has also been shown to promote thyroid tumor growth and angiogenesis in human. These actions of INSL3 are mediated through its G protein-coupled receptor, RXFP2. INSL3, a two-chained peptide, binds to its receptor primarily via its B-chain, whereas elements of the A-chain are essential for receptor activation. In an attempt to design a high-affinity antagonist with potential clinical application as an anticancer agent as well as a contraceptive, we have previously prepared a synthetic parallel dimer of INSL3 B-chain and demonstrated that it binds to RXFP2 with high affinity. In this work, we undertook full pharmacological characterization of this peptide and show that it can antaogonize INSL3-mediated cAMP signaling through RXFP2. Further refinement by truncation of 18 residues yielded a minimized analogue that retained full binding affinity and INSL3 antagonism. It is an attractive lead peptide for in vivo evaluation as an inhibitor of male and female fertility and of INSL3-mediated carcinogenesis.",,
15084136,Design of potent and selective agonists for the human vasopressin V1b receptor based on modifications of [deamino-cys1]arginine vasopressin at position 4.,"The glutamine(4) residue in [deamino-Cys(1)]arginine vasopressin (dAVP) was replaced by a broad series of aliphatic, aromatic, polar, and charged amino acids to give the following peptides: d[Gly(4)]AVP (1), d[Ala(4)]AVP (2), d[Abu(4)]AVP (3), d[Nva(4)]AVP (4), d[Nle(4)]AVP (5), d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Ile(4)]AVP (7), d[Thi(4)]AVP (8), d[Phe(4)]AVP (9), d[Tyr(4)]AVP (10), d[Trp(4)]AVP (11), d[Asn(4)]AVP (12), d[Ser(4)]AVP (13), d[Thr(4)]AVP (14), d[Dap(4)]AVP (15), d[Dab(4)]AVP (16), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), d[Har(4)]AVP (20), and d[Glu(4)]AVP (21). All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods using BOC chemistry for all but one peptide (8), which required the use of Fmoc chemistry. The binding and functional properties of these position 4 substituted analogues of dAVP (d[X(4)]AVP) and the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP (Derick et al. Endocrinology 2002, 143, 4655-4664) were evaluated on human arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1a), V(1b), and V(2) receptors and on the human oxytocin (OT) receptor expressed in living Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Binding studies revealed that broad modifications of the fourth residue of dAVP do not significantly alter affinity for the human V(1b) receptor. Only aromatic (Phe, Tyr, Trp) or negatively charged (Glu) residues reduce V(1b) affinity. By contrast, the human V(1a) and more particularly the human V(2) and the OT receptors are more sensitive to many of these modifications. Thus, the replacement of the Gln(4) residue of dAVP by aliphatic (Leu, Cha) or positively charged (Orn, Lys, Arg, Har) amino acids led to analogues exhibiting drastic reductions of their affinity for the human V(1a), V(2), and OT receptors. Consequently, in addition to the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP, peptides 6 and 17-20 display excellent selectivities for the human V(1b) receptor. The key structural requirement responsible for optimal V(1b) selectivity appears to be the length and branching of the aliphatic side chain of the fourth residue of dAVP. Functional studies performed on CHO cells expressing the different human AVP/OT receptors confirm the V(1b) selectivity of peptides 6, 17, 18, 20, and d[Cha(4)]AVP. However, d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), which triggers an excellent coupling between the human V(2) receptor and adenylyl cyclase, was found to exhibit both V(1b) and V(2) agonism in functional tests. More interestingly, these functional experiments revealed that, depending on the AVP/OT receptor, a given d[X(4)]AVP analogue may behave as a full agonist or as a partial agonist. This strongly suggests that the fourth residue of dAVP plays an important role in the coupling between the hormone-receptor complex, the heterotrimeric G protein, and the effectors. In conclusion, the synthesis of these d[X(4)]AVP analogues led to the discovery of new V(1b) agonists with high affinity and greatly enhanced selectivities. Thus, in addition to d[Cha(4)]AVP, d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), and d[Har(4)]AVP (20) are useful new tools for studying the structure and the function of the human V(1b) receptor.",,
12943195,"Design, synthesis and in vitro evaluation of novel benzo[b]thiophene derivatives as serotonin N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) inhibitors.","Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, AANAT) is the penultimate enzyme in melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine) biosynthesis.

17708745,Determination of protein regions responsible for interactions of amelogenin with CD63 and LAMP1.,"The enamel matrix protein amelogenin is secreted by ameloblasts into the extracellular space to guide the formation of highly ordered hydroxyapatite mineral crystallites, and, subsequently, is almost completely removed during mineral maturation. Amelogenin interacts with the transmembrane proteins CD63 and LAMP (lysosome-associated membrane protein) 1, which are involved in endocytosis. Exogenously added amelogenin has been observed to move rapidly into CD63/LAMP1-positive vesicles in cultured cells. In the present study, we demonstrate the protein region defined by amino acid residues 103-205 for CD63 interacts not only with amelogenin, but also with other enamel matrix proteins (ameloblastin and enamelin). A detailed characterization of binding regions in amelogenin, CD63 and LAMP1 reveals that the amelogenin region defined by residues PLSPILPELPLEAW is responsible for the interaction with CD63 through residues 165-205, with LAMP1 through residues 226-251, and with the related LAMP2 protein through residues 227-259. We predict that the amelogenin binding region is: (i) hydrophobic; (ii) largely disordered; and (iii) accessible to the external environment. In contrast, the binding region of CD63 is likely to be organized in a '7' shape within the mushroom-like structure of CD63 EC2 (extracellular domain 2). In vivo, the protein interactions between the secreted enamel matrix proteins with the membrane-bound proteins are likely to occur at the specialized secretory surfaces of ameloblast cells called Tomes' processes. Such protein-protein interactions may be required to establish short-term order of the forming matrix and/or to mediate feedback signals to the transcriptional machinery of ameloblasts and/or to remove matrix protein debris during enamel biomineralization.",The Biochemical journal,2007
10395669,Determination of residues involved in ligand binding and signal transmission in the human IFN-alpha receptor 2.,"The human IFN-alpha receptor (hIFNAR) is a complex composed of at least two chains, hIFNAR1 and hIFNAR2. We have performed a structure-function analysis of hIFNAR2 extracellular domain regions using anti-hIFNAR2 mAbs (1D3, 1F3, and 3B7) and several type I human IFNs. These mAbs block receptor activation, as determined by IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 formation, and block the antiviral cytopathic effects induced by type I IFNs. We generated alanine substitution mutants of hIFNAR2-IgG and determined that regions of hIFNAR2 are important for the binding of these blocking mAbs and hIFN-alpha2/alpha1. We further demonstrated that residues E78, W101, I104, and D105 are crucial for the binding of hIFN-alpha2/alpha1 and form a defined protrusion when these residues are mapped upon a structural model of hIFNAR2. To confirm that residues important for ligand binding are indeed important for IFN signal transduction, we determined the ability of mouse L929 cells expressing hIFNAR2 extracellular domain mutants to mediate hIFN signal. hIFN-alpha8, previously shown to signal a response in L929 cells expressing hIFNAR1, was unable to signal in L929 cells expressing hIFNAR2. Transfected cells expressing hIFNAR2 containing mutations at residues E78, W101, I104, or D105 were unresponsive to hIFN-alpha2, but remained responsive to hIFN-beta. In summary, we have identified specific residues of hIFNAR2 important for the binding to hIFN-alpha2/1 and demonstrate that specific regions of the IFNAR interact with the subspecies of type I IFN in different manners.",,
8235612,Determination of type I receptor specificity by the type II receptors for TGF-beta or activin.,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and activin signal primarily through interaction with type I and type II receptors, which are transmembrane serine-threonine kinases. Tsk 7L is a type I receptor for TGF-beta and requires coexpression of the type II TGF-beta receptor for ligand binding. Tsk 7L also specifically bound activin, when coexpressed with the type IIA activin receptor. Tsk 7L could associate with either type II receptor and the ligand binding specificity of Tsk 7L was conferred by the type II receptor. Tsk 7L can therefore act as type I receptor for both activin and TGF-beta, and possibly other ligands.",,
9437714,Development of high affinity selective VIP1 receptor agonists.,"The biological effects of VIP are mediated by at least two VIP receptors: the VIP1 and the VIP2 receptors that were cloned in rat, human and mice. As the mRNA coding for each receptor are located in different tissues, it is likely that each receptor modulates different functions. It is therefore of interest to obtain selective agonists for each receptor subtype. In the present work, we achieved the synthesis of two VIP1 receptor selective agonsits derived from secretin and GRF. [R16]chicken secretin had IC50 values of binding of 1,10,000, 20, and 3000 nM for the rat VIP1-, VIP2-, secretion- and PACAP receptors, respectively. This peptide, however, had a weaker affinity for the human VIP1 receptor (IC50 of 60 nM). The chimeric, substituted peptide [K15, R16, L27]VIP(1-7)/GRF(8-27) had IC50 values of binding of 1,10,000, 10,000 and 30,000 nM for the rat VIP1-, VIP2-, secretin- and PACAP receptors, respectively. Furthermore, its also showed an IC50 of 0.8 nM for the human VIP1 receptor and a low affinity for the human VIP2 receptor. It is unlikely that this GRF analogue interacted with a high affinity to the pituitary GRF receptors as it did not stimulate rat pituitary adenylate cyclase activity. The two described analogues stimulated maximally the adenylate cyclase activity on membranes expressing each receptor subtype.",Peptides,1997

22915648,Differences in signaling through the B-cell leukemia oncoprotein CRLF2 in response to TSLP and through mutant JAK2.,"Approximately 10% of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs) overexpress the cytokine receptor subunit CRLF2, which may confer a poor prognosis. CRLF2 binds its ligand thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) as a heterodimer with IL7R. Subsets of CRLF2-overexpressing B-ALLs also have a gain-of-function CRLF2 F232C mutation or activating mutations in JAK2. Whether these mutant alleles confer differences in signaling has not been addressed. Through a domain mutation analysis, we demonstrate a distinct dependence on the CRLF2 intracellular tyrosine Y368 in signaling by CRLF2 F232C, but not signaling induced by TSLP or through CRLF2/mutant JAK2. In contrast, CRLF2 signaling in each context is strictly dependent on both the CRLF2 box1 domain and the intracellular tryptophan W286. Using a global quantitative analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by TSLP, we previously identified TSLP-induced phosphorylation of multiple kinases implicated in B-cell receptor signaling, including Lyn, Btk, Hck, Syk, MAPK8, MAPK9, and MAPK10. We now demonstrate that cells dependent on CRLF2/mutant JAK2 have reduced phosphorylation at these targets, suggesting that the kinases promote TSLP-mediated proliferation but serve as negative regulators of CRLF2/mutant JAK2 signaling. Thus, targetable nodes downstream of CRLF2 differ based on the presence or absence of additional mutations in CRLF2 signaling components.",Blood,2012
11123370,Different binding modes of amphibian and human corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 and type 2 receptors: evidence for evolutionary differences.,"The binding characteristics of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) type 1 (CRF(1)) and type 2 (CRF(2)) receptors from human (hCRF(1) and hCRF(2alpha)) and Xenopus (xCRF(1) and xCRF(2)) were compared using four different (125)I-labeled CRF analogs, the agonists (125)I-CRF and (125)I-sauvagine, and the antagonists (125)I-astressin ((125)I-AST) and (125)I-antisauvagine-30 ((125)I-aSVG). The hCRF(2alpha) and xCRF(2) receptors bound all four radioligands with different affinities, whereas hCRF(1) did not bind (125)I-aSVG, and xCRF(1) bound neither (125)I-sauvagine nor (125)I-aSVG. Competitive binding studies using unlabeled agonists and antagonists with hCRF(1) and hCRF(2alpha) receptors revealed that most agonists exhibited higher affinity in displacing agonist radioligands compared with displacement of antagonist radioligands. Exceptions were the agonists human and rat urocortin, which displayed high-affinity binding in the presence of either (125)I-labeled agonist or antagonist ligands. In contrast, the affinities of antagonists were independent of the nature of the radioligand. We also found that, in contrast to the mammalian CRF receptors, the affinity of ligand binding to xCRF(1) and xCRF(2) receptors strongly depended on the nature of the radioligand used for competition. For xCRF(1), competitors showed different rank order binding profiles with (125)I-CRF compared with (125)I-AST as the displaceable ligand. Similarly, binding of competitors to the xCRF(2) receptor showed markedly different profiles with (125)I-CRF as the competed ligand compared with the other radioligands. These data demonstrate that amphibian CRF receptors have distinctly different binding modes compared with their mammalian counterparts.",,
8621513,Different single receptor domains determine the distinct G protein coupling profiles of members of the vasopressin receptor family.,"The vasopressin receptor family is unique among all classes of peptide receptors in that its individual members couple to different subsets of G proteins. The V1a vasopressin receptor, for example, is preferentially linked to G proteins of the Gq/11 class (biochemical response: stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis), whereas the V2 vasopressin receptor is selectively coupled to Gs (biochemical response: stimulation of adenylyl cyclase). To elucidate the structural basis underlying this functional heterogeneity, we have systematically exchanged different intracellular domains between the V1a and V2 receptors. Transient expression of the resulting hybrid receptors in COS-7 cells showed that all mutant receptors containing V1a receptor sequence in the second intracellular loop were able to activate the phosphatidylinositol pathway with high efficiency. On the other hand, only those hybrid receptors containing V2 receptor sequence in the third intracellular loop were capable of efficiently stimulating cAMP production. These findings suggest that the differential G protein coupling profiles of individual members of a structurally closely related receptor subfamily can be determined by different single intracellular receptor domains.",,
10570056,Different vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor domains are involved in the selective recognition of two VPAC(2)-selective ligands.,"A vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) analog, acylated on the amino-terminal histidine by hexanoic acid (C(6)-VIP), behaved as a VPAC(2) preferring agonist in binding and functional studies on human VIP receptors, and radioiodinated C(6)-VIP was a suitable ligand for binding studies on wild-type and chimeric receptors. We evaluated the properties of C(6)-VIP, its analog AcHis(1)-VIP, and the VPAC(2)-selective agonist Ro 25-1553 on the wild-type VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) receptors and on the chimeric receptors exchanging the different domains between both receptors. VIP had a normal affinity and efficacy on the chimeras starting with the amino-terminal VPAC(2) receptor sequence. The binding and functional profile of these chimeric receptors suggested that the high affinity of Ro 25-1553 for VPAC(2) receptors is supported by the amino-terminal extracellular domain, whereas the ability to prefer C(6)-VIP over VIP is supported by the VPAC(2) fifth transmembrane (TM5)-EC(3) receptor domain. These results further support the hypothesis that the central and carboxyl-terminal regions of the peptide (modified in RO 25-1553) recognize the extracellular amino-terminal region domain, whereas the amino-terminal VIP amino acids bind to the TM receptor core. VIP had a reduced affinity and efficacy on the N-VPAC(1)/VPAC(2) and on the N-->EC(2)-VPAC(1)/VPAC(2) chimeric receptors. C(6)-VIP behaved as a high-affinity agonist on these constructions. The antagonists [AcHis(1),D-Phe(2),Lys(15),Arg(16), Leu(27)]VIP(3-7)/GRF(8-27) and VIP(5-27) had comparable affinities for the wild-type receptors and for the two latter chimeras, supporting the hypothesis that these chimeras were properly folded but unable to reach the high-agonist-affinity, active receptor conformation in response to VIP binding.",,
2570358,Differential activation by atrial and brain natriuretic peptides of two different receptor guanylate cyclases.,"Alpha atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide are homologous polypeptide hormones involved in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. These two natriuretic peptides apparently share common receptors and stimulate the intracellular production of cyclic GMP as a second messenger. Molecular cloning has defined two types of natriuretic peptide receptors: the ANP-C receptor of relative molecular mass (Mr) 60-70,000 (60-70 K), which is not coupled to cGMP production and may function in the clearance of ANP and the ANP-A receptor of Mr 120-140 K, which is a membrane form of guanylate cyclase in which ligand binding to the extracellular domain activates the cytoplasmic domain of the enzyme. Here we report the cloning and expression of a second human natriuretic peptide-receptor guanylate cyclase, the ANP-B receptor. The ANP-B receptor is preferentially activated by porcine brain natriuretic peptide rather than human alpha-ANP, whereas the ANP-A receptor responds similarly to both natriuretic peptides. These observations may have important implications for our understanding of the central and peripheral control of cardiovascular homeostasis.",Nature,1989
9552007,Differential activities of secreted lymphotoxin-alpha3 and membrane lymphotoxin-alpha1beta2 in lymphotoxin-induced inflammation: critical role of TNF receptor 1 signaling.,"Lymphotoxin (LT, LT alpha, TNF beta) is a member of the immediate TNF family that also includes TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin-beta (LT beta). LT is produced by activated lymphocytes and functions as either a secreted homotrimer or a membrane-associated heterotrimer that includes the transmembrane protein LT beta. Secreted LT alpha3 can bind to two cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, while the membrane-bound heterotrimer LT alpha1beta2 has been shown to interact with a distinct receptor, LT betaR. LT alpha induces inflammation at the sites of expression of a rat insulin promoter-driven lymphotoxin (RIPLT) transgene in the pancreas and kidney. To determine the role of the various ligands and their receptors in LT-induced inflammation, mice deficient in either TNFR1, TNFR2, or LT beta were crossed to RIPLT-transgenic mice. Our results indicate that LT alpha-induced inflammation is dependent on the interaction of LT alpha3 with TNFR1, and there is no obvious role for TNFR2, since in its absence, LT alpha-induced inflammation is quantitatively and qualitatively similar to that seen in the wild type. However, the absence of LT beta results in accentuated infiltration of the kidney with an increase in the proportion of memory cells in the infiltrate. These data show a crucial role for the secreted LT alpha3 signaling via TNFR1 in LT alpha-induced inflammation, and a separate and distinct role for the membrane LT alpha1beta2 form in this inflammatory process.",,

ApoER2 is a cell surface molecule that elicits intracellular signal transduction through binding of Reelin. The structural requirements for Reelin binding to apoER2 and the receptor domains involved in this process are unclear at present. Using a series of receptor mutants, we characterized the interaction of apoER2 with Reelin and compared this interaction to that of apoER2 with the receptor-associated protein (RAP), an apoER2 ligand that does not induce signaling. By surface plasmon resonance we demonstrate that apoER2 exhibits 6-fold higher affinity for Reelin than the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), which also functions as a Reelin receptor (K(D) 0.2 nM versus K(D) 1.2 nM). Acidic amino acid residues in complement-type repeat domains 1 and 3 of apoER2 are required for Reelin binding. The same regions of the receptor are also bound by RAP with a 25-fold lower affinity (K(D) 5 nM). Whereas RAP binds to apoER2 with a 1:1 stoichiometry, experimental evidence suggests that Reelin associates with two or more receptor molecules simultaneously to achieve high-affinity interaction. This finding indicates that aggregation of apoER2 by multivalent ligands such as Reelin may be the structural basis for signal transduction.",Biochemistry,2003
10409677,Differential binding of vascular endothelial growth factor B splice and proteolytic isoforms to neuropilin-1.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) is expressed in various tissues, especially strongly in the heart, and binds selectively to one of the VEGF receptors, VEGFR-1. The two splice isoforms, VEGF-B(167) and VEGF-B(186), have identical NH(2)-terminal cystine knot growth factor domains but differ in their COOH-terminal domains which give these forms their distinct biochemical properties. In this study, we show that both splice isoforms of VEGF-B bind specifically to Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a receptor for collapsins/semaphorins and for the VEGF(165) isoform. The NRP1 binding of VEGF-B could be competed by an excess of VEGF(165). The binding of VEGF-B(167) was mediated by the heparin binding domain, whereas the binding of VEGF-B(186) to NRP1 was regulated by exposure of a short COOH-terminal proline-rich peptide upon its proteolytic processing. In immunohistochemistry, NRP1 distribution was found to be overlapping or adjacent to known sites of VEGF-B expression in several tissues, in particular in the developing heart, suggesting the involvement of VEGF-B in NRP1-mediated signaling.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
16531413,Differential contributions of motilin receptor extracellular domains for peptide and non-peptidyl agonist binding and activity.,"The family of G protein-coupled receptors that includes receptors for motilin, ghrelin, and growth hormone secretagogue has substantial potential importance as drug targets. Understanding of the molecular basis of hormone binding and receptor activation should provide insights that are helpful in the development of such drugs. We previously examined the unique second extracellular loop domain of the motilin receptor, identifying key epitopes in perimembranous locations at each end of this long loop (Matsuura, B., Dong, M., and Miller, L. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 9834-9839). Here, we have extended that work, examining the other predicted extracellular domains of the motilin receptor by using sequential deletions of segments ranging from one to six amino acid residues and site-directed alanine replacement mutagenesis approaches. Each construct was transiently expressed in COS cells, and characterized for motilin- and erythromycin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses and motilin radioligand binding. Only those receptor segments that included key Cys residues in positions 25, 30, and 111 or perimembranous regions at the ends of the amino terminus and the first and third extracellular loops disrupted motilin biological activity. Each of these Cys deletions also disrupted action of erythromycin. Alanine replacements for each of the potentially important amino acid residues in the perimembranous segments revealed that residues Gly36, Pro103, Leu109, and Phe332 were responsible for the selective negative impact on motilin biological activity, while responding normally to erythromycin. These results support the presence of functionally important disulfide bonds in the motilin receptor ectodomain and demonstrate that the structural determinants for binding and biological activity of peptide and non-peptidyl agonist ligands are distinct, with a broad extracellular perimembranous base contributing to normal motilin binding.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2006
11781320,Differential determinants for peptide and non-peptidyl ligand binding to the motilin receptor. Critical role of second extracellular loop for peptide binding and action.,"The predicted second extracellular loop domain of the motilin receptor is of particular interest because it is a region that is quite distinct from the analogous regions in other family members that are most closely related and because the initial report of the photoaffinity labeling of a domain of this receptor included this region (Coulie, B. J., Matsuura, B., Dong, M., Hadac, E. M., Pinon, D. I., Feighner, S. D., Howard, A. D., and Miller, L. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 35518-35522). In the current work, motilin receptor constructs were prepared that included sequential deletions ranging from single residues to twelve amino acid segments throughout this 67 amino acid domain. Each construct was expressed in COS cells and characterized for motilin radioligand binding and motilin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses. The only segments that had negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity included deletion constructs DeltaCys(235), Delta179-182, and Delta241-246. Cys(235) is likely involved in the highly conserved and functionally important disulfide bond linking the first and second loops of G protein-coupled receptors. Alanine replacements for each of the amino acid residues in the other two segments revealed that the perimembranous residues at both ends of this loop, Val(179) and Leu(245) and Arg(246), were responsible for the negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity. Of note, these mutants responded normally to the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin. These data support important functional roles for both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal perimembranous regions of the second loop for responses to the natural agonist peptide, while supporting independent determinants for action of a non-peptidyl agonist ligand.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
10202040,Differential effects of leukotactin-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha on neutrophils mediated by CCR1.,"The human CC chemokine leukotactin-1 (Lkn-1) is both a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes and a potent agonist for CCR1 and CCR3. However, human neutrophils do not migrate when the cells are stimulated with other human CC chemokines, such as human macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (hMIP-1 alpha) and eotaxin, which also use the CCR1 and CCR3 as their receptors. In this report, we demonstrate that while hMIP-1 alpha induced a negligible level of calcium flux and chemotaxis, Lkn-1 produced a high level of calcium flux and chemotaxis in human neutrophils. Lkn-1 cross-desensitized hMIP-1 alpha-induced calcium flux, but hMIP-1 alpha had little effect on the Lkn-1-induced response in human neutrophils. The same pattern was observed in peritoneal neutrophils from wild-type mice, whereas neutrophils from CCR1-/- mice failed to respond to either MIP-1 alpha or Lkn-1. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of receptor for both hMIP-1 alpha and Lkn-1 on human neutrophils with dissociation constants (Kd) of 3.2 nM and 1.1 nM, respectively. We conclude that CCR1 is a receptor mediating responses to both MIP-1 alpha and Lkn-1 on neutrophils and produces different biological responses depending on the ligand bound.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1999
9556914,Differential in vivo activities of bovine growth hormone analogues.,"In rodents, bovine (b) growth hormone (GH) binds only to GH receptors, while human (h) GH binds to both GH and PRL receptors. The phenotypic consequences of expression of bGH and hGH in transgenic mice are different and, in some cases, opposite. In the present study, site-directed in vitro mutagenesis of the bGH gene was used systematically to eliminate its differences from hGH at one, two, three or four suspected of conferring lactogenic activity: D11, H18, S57 and T60, respectively (corresponding to sites 12, 19, 57 and 60 of the bGH molecule). The resulting bGH analogues were expressed in cell lines and in transgenic mice. All of the seven bGH analogues produced retained their ability to bind to GH receptors and exhibited somatogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. However, none of them were able to bind to PRL receptors or to elicit detectable lactogenic response in vitro. Transgenic animals expressing any of the generated analogues were characterized by gigantism and splanchnomegaly. The effects of expression of each of the double, triple or quadruple mutants on the seminal vesicle weight resembled the effects of wild-type hGH and differed from the effects of expression of wild-type bGH. There were differences between the effects of the expression of different bGH analogues on plasma PRL levels and on the PRL response to pharmacological blockade of catecholamine synthesis. Plasma LH levels in ovariectomized females were suppressed by several of the analogues tested, an effect not seen in animals expressing wild-type bGH or hGH. Dopamine turnover in the median eminence of male mice was also altered in animals expressing different bGH analogues but not in those expressing wild-type bGH or hGH. In ovariectomized females, the effects of different bGH analogs on the turnover of dopamine and norepinephrine in the median eminence included changes resembling those detected in animals expressing hGH, as well as alterations differing from the effects of both bGH and hGH. The results indicate that biological actions of these bGH analogues cannot be characterized simply in terms of enhanced or reduced somatogenic or lactogenic activity and raise a possibility that different sites, domains or features of tri-dimensional structure of GH are involved in its actions on different cellular targets.",,
11010812,Differential induction of gelatinase B (MMP-9) and gelatinase A (MMP-2) in T lymphocytes upon alpha(4)beta(1)-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1 and the CS-1 peptide of fibronectin.,"Integrin alpha(4)beta(1) on the surface of T lymphocytes interacts with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and fibronectin during migration of lymphocytes from the blood to sites of inflammation. Migrating lymphocytes actively modify their environment through a number of mechanisms including proteolysis of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) synthesized by the cells. In this study, expression of MMP upon alpha(4)beta(1)-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to two major ligands, the IIICS-1 domain of fibronectin and VCAM-1, has been examined. Adhesion of T lymphoblastoid Jurkat cells to the CS-1 peptide induced expression of mRNA for two MMPs, gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9). As evaluated by relative RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses, the level of mRNA was upregulated about 4- to 5-fold for both MMPs compared to control cells maintained in suspension. With time, both enzymes were detected in conditioned media and inside the cells, and their identities were verified by Western blotting and gelatin zymography. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the second major alpha(4)beta(1) ligand, VCAM-1, upregulated mRNA for MMP-2 (3.5-fold) and failed to induce expression of mRNA for MMP-9. Accordingly, only MMP-2 protein was detected in conditioned media of cells adherent to VCAM-1. Occupancy of alpha(4)beta(1) on the surface of suspended cells with soluble CS-1 peptide or VCAM-1 did not upregulate synthesis and release of MMPs. A similar pattern of induction of MMPs after adhesion to CS-1 and VCAM-1 was observed in T lymphocytes isolated from human blood. These results demonstrate that adhesion of T lymphocytes through alpha(4)beta(1) to different ligands, which bind to similar or overlapping sites in the integrin, induces intracellular events leading to distinct patterns of MMPs biosynthesis.",Experimental cell research,2000
8302267,Differential pharmacology of cloned human and mouse B2 bradykinin receptors.,"The pharmacology of cloned B2 bradykinin receptors heterologously expressed in cell lines lacking any endogenous bradykinin receptors was analyzed. The possibility of B2 bradykinin receptor heterogeneity had been proposed on the basis of numerous studies in various tissue preparations. The results reported here permit a direct evaluation of some of these hypotheses by examining the pharmacological properties of cloned bradykinin receptors. A cloned human B2 bradykinin receptor was stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. The data suggest that in response to bradykinin (BK), the cloned receptor activates both phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and arachidonic acid release by independent pathways. Thus, the activation of these two second messenger pathways does not require the existence of two B2 bradykinin receptor subtypes. A mouse gene encoding the B2 bradykinin receptor was isolated, and the coding region was expressed in COS-7 cells. This murine receptor exhibited the pharmacological properties of a ""classical"" B2 bradykinin receptor. A comparison of the pharmacological profiles of cloned human and murine homologs of the B2 bradykinin receptor indicates that both receptors bind agonists with similar properties. However, the two receptors differ dramatically in their affinity for some peptide antagonists. The mouse receptor has a 60- to 80-fold higher affinity for [D-Arg0Hyp3, Thi5,8,D-Phe7]BK and [D-Arg0,Hyp3,D-Phe7]BK than its human homolog. Thus, the species of a bradykinin receptor can have a significant effect on its pharmacology. The cloning, expression, and pharmacological comparison of human and mouse B2 bradykinin receptor genes indicate that some of the previous reports of B2 receptor subtypes can be explained by species differences in a single B2 bradykinin receptor gene.",,
15721238,Differential requirement for Plexin-A3 and -A4 in mediating responses of sensory and sympathetic neurons to distinct class 3 Semaphorins.,"The class 3 Semaphorins Sema3A and Sema3F are potent axonal repellents that cause repulsion by binding Neuropilin-1 and Neuropilin-2, respectively. Plexins are implicated as signaling coreceptors for the Neuropilins, but the identity of the Plexins that transduce Sema3A and Sema3F responses in vivo is uncertain. Here, we show that Plexin-A3 and -A4 are key determinants of these responses, through analysis of a Plexin-A3/Plexin-A4 double mutant mouse. Sensory and sympathetic neurons from the double mutant are insensitive to Sema3A and Sema3F in vitro, and defects in axonal projections in vivo correspond to those seen in Neuropilin-1 and -2 mutants. Interestingly, we found a differential requirement for these two Plexins: signaling via Neuropilin-1 is mediated principally by Plexin-A4, whereas signaling via Neuropilin-2 is mediated principally by Plexin-A3. Thus, Plexin-A3 and -A4 contribute to the specificity of axonal responses to class 3 Semaphorins.",Neuron,2005
7541633,Differential role of the low affinity neurotrophin receptor (p75) in retrograde axonal transport of the neurotrophins.,"The receptor mechanisms mediating the retrograde axonal transport of the neurotrophins have been investigated in adult rats. We show that transport of the TrkB ligands NT-4 and BDNF to peripheral neurons is dependent on the low affinity neurotrophin receptor (LNR). Pharmacological manipulation of LNR in vivo using either an anti-LNR antibody or a soluble recombinant LNR extracellular domain completely blocked retrograde transport of NT-4 and BDNF to sensory neurons, while having minimal effects on the transport of NGF in either sensory or sympathetic neurons. Furthermore, in mice with a null mutation of LNR, the transport of NT-4 and BDNF, but not NGF, was dramatically reduced. These observations demonstrate a selective role for LNR in retrograde transport of the various neurotrophins from distinct target regions in vivo.",Neuron,1995

9692902,"Differential usage of the CXC chemokine receptors 1 and 2 by interleukin-8, granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 and epithelial-cell-derived neutrophil attractant-78.","The inflammatory response is mediated by a family of chemotactic cytokines, designated chemokines. The receptor usage of the CXC chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (GCP-2) was compared with that of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and epithelial-cell-derived neutrophil attractant-78 (ENA-78). Chemokine activities were evaluated by measurement of intracellular calcium increase and by chemotaxis and binding assays, using CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)-transfected cell lines. GCP-2 was equally potent at inducing a rise in [Ca2+]i in both CXCR1-transfected and CXCR2-transfected cells (minimal effective concentration 3 nM). IL-8 augmented the [Ca2+]i more efficiently in CXCR1-transfectants than in CXCR2-transfectants, whereas for ENA-78, threefold higher concentrations were necessary to obtain a calcium response in CXCR1-transfected cells than in CXCR2-transfectants. GCP-2 desensitized the calcium increase induced by IL-8 in both CXCR1-transfected and CXCR2-transfected cells, but ENA-78 only affected the IL-8-induced calcium response in CXCR2-transfectants. The half-maximal effective concentrations for migration of CXCR2-transfectants in response to GCP-2 and ENA-78 were similar (0.1 nM), whereas GCP-2 was tenfold more potent than ENA-78 on CXCR1-transfectants. Half-maximal migration of CXCR1-transfected and CXCR2-transfected cells was obtained with IL-8 at concentrations of no more than 0.01 nM. Radiolabeled IL-8 could efficiently be displaced from CXCR2 by IL-8, GCP-2 and ENA-78. In contrast, only IL-8 and GCP-2 but not ENA-78, competed for 125I-IL-8 binding to CXCR1. From these data, it can be concluded that, in addition to IL-8, GCP-2, but not ENA-78, efficiently binds to both CXCR1 and CXCR2. The differential receptor usage of the structurally related ELR+ CXC chemokines GCP-2 and ENA-78 is indicative of a different role in inflammatory reactions.",,
15247290,Diffuse pharmacophoric domains of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and further insights into the interaction of VIP with the N-terminal ectodomain of human VPAC1 receptor by photoaffinity labeling with [Bpa6]-VIP.,"The widespread 28-amino acid neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) exerts its many biological effects through interaction with serpentine class II G protein-coupled receptors named VPAC receptors. We previously provided evidence for a physical contact between the side chain at position 22 of VIP and the N-terminal ectodomain of the hVPAC1 receptor (Tan, Y. V., Couvineau, A., Van Rampelbergh, J., and Laburthe, M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 36531-36536). We explored here the contact site between hVPAC1 receptor and the side chain at position 6 of VIP by photoaffinity labeling. The photoreactive para-benzoyl-l-Phe (Bpa) was substituted for Phe(6) in VIP resulting in [Bpa(6)]-VIP, which was shown to be a hVPAC1 receptor agonist in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the recombinant receptor. After obtaining the covalent (125)I-[Bpa(6)-VIP].hVPAC1 receptor complex, it was sequentially cleaved by cyanogen bromide, peptide N-glycosidase F, endopeptidase Glu-C, and trypsin, and the cleavage products were analyzed by electrophoresis. The data demonstrated that (125)I-[Bpa(6)-VIP] were covalently attached to the short 104-108 fragment within the N-terminal ectodomain of the receptor. The data were confirmed by creation of a receptor mutant with new CNBr cleavage site. In a three-dimensional model of the receptor N-terminal ectodomain, this fragment was located on one edge of the putative VIP-binding groove and was adjacent to the fragment covalently attached to the side chain at position 22 of VIP. Altogether these data showed that the central part of VIP, at least between Phe(6) and Tyr(22), interacts with the N-terminal ectodomain of the hVPAC1 receptor.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2004

20054002,DIP2A functions as a FSTL1 receptor.,"FSTL1 is an extracellular glycoprotein whose functional significance in physiological and pathological processes is incompletely understood. Recently, we have shown that FSTL1 acts as a muscle-derived secreted factor that is up-regulated by Akt activation and ischemic stress and that FSTL1 exerts favorable actions on the heart and vasculature. Here, we sought to identify the receptor that mediates the cellular actions of FSTL1. We identified DIP2A as a novel FSTL1-binding partner from the membrane fraction of endothelial cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed a direct physical interaction between FSTL1 and DIP2A. DIP2A was present on the cell surface of endothelial cells, and knockdown of DIP2A by small interfering RNA reduced the binding of FSTL1 to cells. In cultured endothelial cells, knockdown of DIP2A by small interfering RNA diminished FSTL1-stimulated survival, migration, and differentiation into network structures and inhibited FSTL1-induced Akt phosphorylation. In cultured cardiac myocytes, ablation of DIP2A reduced the protective actions of FSTL1 on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis and suppressed FSTL1-induced Akt phosphorylation. These data indicate that DIP2A functions as a novel receptor that mediates the cardiovascular protective effects of FSTL1.",,
8692965,Direct binding of a soluble natural killer cell inhibitory receptor to a soluble human leukocyte antigen-Cw4 class I major histocompatibility complex molecule.,"Natural killer (NK) cells expressing specific p58 NK receptors are inhibited from lysing target cells that express human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-C class I major histocompatibility complex molecules. To investigate the interaction between p58 NK receptors and HLA-Cw4, the extracellular domain of the p58 NK receptor specific for HLA-Cw4 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and refolded from purified inclusion bodies. The refolded NK receptor is a monomer in solution. It interacts specifically with HLA-Cw4, blocking the binding of a p58-Ig fusion protein to HLA-Cw4-expressing cells, but does not block the binding of a p58-Ig fusion protein specific for HLA-Cw3 to HLA-Cw3-expressing cells. The bacterially expressed extracellular domain of HLA-Cw4 heavy chain and beta2-microglobulin were refolded in the presence of a HLA-Cw4-specific peptide. Direct binding between the soluble p58 NK receptor and the soluble HLA-Cw4-peptide complex was observed by native gel electrophoresis. Titration binding assays show that soluble monomeric receptor forms a 1:1 complex with HLA-Cw4, independent of the presence of Zn2+. The formation of complexes between soluble, recombinant molecules indicates that HLA-Cw4 is sufficient for specific ligation by the NK receptor and that neither glycoprotein requires carbohydrate for the interaction.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1996

Genetic evidence suggests that interpretation of the Reelin signal by migrating neurons involves two neuronal cell surface proteins, the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and the apoE receptor 2 (ApoER2) as well as a cytosolic adaptor protein, Disabled-1 (Dab1). We show that Reelin binds directly and specifically to the ectodomains of VLDLR and ApoER2 in vitro and that blockade of VLDLR and ApoER2 correlates with loss of Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Disabled-1 in cultured primary embryonic neurons. Furthermore, mice that lack either Reelin or both VLDLR and ApoER2 exhibit hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-stabilizing protein tau. Taken together, these findings suggest that Reelin acts via VLDLR and ApoER2 to regulate Disabled-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and microtubule function in neurons.",Neuron,1999
14557255,Direct determination of the interleukin-6 binding epitope of the interleukin-6 receptor by NMR spectroscopy.,"All cytokines belonging to the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-type family of cytokines utilize receptors that have a modular build of several immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III-like domains. Characteristic of these receptors is a cytokine receptor homology region consisting of two such fibronectin domains defined by a set of four conserved cysteines and a tryptophan-serine-X-tryptophan-serine sequence motif. On target cells, interleukin-6 first binds to its specific receptor and subsequently to a homodimer of the signal transducer protein gp130. The interleukin-6 receptor consists of three extracellular domains. The N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain is not involved in ligand binding, whereas the third membrane proximal fibronectin-like domain accounts for more than 90% of the binding energy to IL-6. Here, the key residues of this fibronectin-like domain involved in the interaction with IL-6 are described. Chemical shift mapping data with 15N-labeled IL-6R-D3 and unlabeled IL-6 coupled with recent structural data clearly reveal the epitope within the IL-6R-D3 responsible for mediating the high affinity interaction with its cognate cytokine.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2004
8982657,Direct evidence for two distinct G proteins coupling with thrombin receptors in human neuroblastoma SH-EP cells.,"Thrombin receptor-G protein coupling was investigated in the human epithelial neuroblastoma cell line, SH-EP. In these cells, both alpha-thrombin and thrombin receptor peptides, SFLLRNP (one-letter amino-acid code), which are newly exposed following cleavage by alpha-thrombin, stimulated GTPase activity about 2-fold over basal activity. Pertussis toxin treatment only partially attenuated alpha-thrombin- and SFLLRNP-stimulated GTPase activity by 50%, whereas antibody raised against synthetic heptapeptide SFLLRNP blocked alpha-thrombin-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis more than 80%. Immunoprecipitation studies using this antibody showed that both Gi2, a subtype of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) mediating inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and Gq/G11, a G protein mediating stimulation of phospholipase C, were activated by alpha-thrombin. These data suggest that in these cells the thrombin receptor activates pertussis toxin-sensitive and pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins simultaneously and directly couples to Gi2 and Gq/G11, which mediate different signaling pathways.",,
11337500,Direct identification of human oxytocin receptor-binding domains using a photoactivatable cyclic peptide antagonist: comparison with the human V1a vasopressin receptor.,"Understanding of the molecular determinants responsible for antagonist binding to the oxytocin receptor should provide important insights that facilitate rational design of potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of preterm labor. To study ligand/receptor interactions, we used a novel photosensitive radioiodinated antagonist of the human oxytocin receptor, d(CH(2))(5) [Tyr(Me)(2),Thr(4),Orn(8),Phe(3(125)I,4N(3))-NH(2)9]vasotocin. This ligand had an equivalent high affinity for human oxytocin and V(1a) vasopressin receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Taking advantage of this dual specificity, we conducted photoaffinity labeling experiments on both receptors. Photolabeled oxytocin and V(1a) receptors appeared as a unique protein band at 70-75 kDa and two labeled protein bands at 85-90 and 46 kDa, respectively. To identify contact sites between the antagonist and the receptors, the labeled 70-75- and the 46-kDa proteins were cleaved with CNBr and digested with Lys-C and Arg-C endoproteinases. The fragmentation patterns allowed the identification of a covalently labeled region in the oxytocin receptor transmembrane domain III consisting of the residues Leu(114)-Val(115)-Lys(116). Analysis of contact sites in the V(1a) receptor led to the identification of the homologous region consisting of the residues Val(126)-Val(127)-Lys(128). Binding domains were confirmed by mutation of several CNBr cleavage sites in the oxytocin receptor and of one Lys-C cleavage site in the V(1a) receptor. The results are in agreement with previous experimental data and three-dimensional models of agonist and antagonist binding to members of the oxytocin/vasopressin receptor family.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
9108031,Direct mapping of an agonist-binding domain within the parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor by photoaffinity crosslinking.,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) are calciotropic hormones interacting with a shared seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor, which is located predominantly in bone and kidney. To map the interface of the bimolecular interaction between hormone and receptor, we designed and radioiodinated a bioactive, photoreactive PTH agonist, (125)I-[Nle(8,18),Lys13(epsilon-p-(3-I-Bz)Bz),L-2-Nal(23),Arg(26,2 7),Tyr34] bPTH-(1-34)NH2 ((125)I-all-R-K13). This ligand contains a photoreactive benzophenone moiety attached to the side chain of Lys13. All other lysyl residues are substituted by argynyls. The analog photocrosslinks specifically to the recombinant hPTH/PTHrP receptor stably transfected into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293/C-21 cells, approximately 400,000 receptors per cell), generating a diffuse approximately 87-kDa band on SDS/PAGE autoradiography. To identify the ""contact domain"" within the hPTH/PTHrP receptor involved in binding of (125)I-all-R-K13, the radiolabeled band containing the ligand-receptor conjugate was subjected to chemical and enzymatic cleavage. Two independent pathways of sequential digestion were used: Route A, lysyl endopeptidase C, then endo-N-glycosidase F, followed by cyanogen bromide; Route B, cyanogen bromide followed by endo-N-glycosydase F. The identified domain is in contact with position 13 in (125)I-all-R-K13 and corresponds to amino acids 173-189 of the hPTH/PTHrP receptor, located at the C-terminal region of the N-terminal extracellular domain.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1997
21207944,Direct measurements on CD24-mediated rolling of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells on E-selectin.,"Tumor cell rolling on the endothelium plays a key role in the initial steps of cancer metastasis, i.e., extravasation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Identification of the ligands that induce the rolling of cells is thus critical to understanding how cancers metastasize. We have previously demonstrated that MCF-7 cells, human breast cancer cells, exhibit the rolling response selectively on E-selectin-immobilized surfaces. However, the ligand that induces rolling of MCF-7 cells on E-selectin has not yet been identified, as these cells lack commonly known E-selectin ligands. Here we report, for the first time to our knowledge, a set of quantitative and direct evidence demonstrating that CD24 expressed on MCF-7 cell membranes is responsible for rolling of the cells on E-selectin. The binding kinetics between CD24 and E-selectin was directly measured using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which revealed that CD24 has a binding affinity against E-selectin (K(D) = 3.4 ± 0.7 nM). The involvement of CD24 in MCF-7 cell rolling was confirmed by the rolling behavior that was completely blocked when cells were treated with anti-CD24. A simulated study by flowing microspheres coated with CD24 onto E-selectin-immobilized surfaces further revealed that the binding is Ca(2+)-dependent. Additionally, we have found that actin filaments are involved in the CD24-mediated cell rolling, as observed by the decreased rolling velocities of the MCF-7 cells upon treatment with cytochalasin D (an inhibitor of actin-filament dynamics) and the stationary binding of CD24-coated microspheres (the lack of actins) on the E-selectin-immobilized slides. Given that CD24 is known to be directly related to enhanced invasiveness of cancer cells, our results imply that CD24-based cell rolling on E-selectin mediates, at least partially, cancer cell extravasation, resulting in metastasis.",Analytical chemistry,2011
8663057,Direct or C5a-induced activation of heterotrimeric Gi2 proteins in human neutrophils is associated with interaction between formyl peptide receptors and the cytoskeleton.,"The binding of ligands to N-formyl peptide chemoattractant receptors in human neutrophils results in a rapid association of these receptors with a cytoskeletal fraction and a specific activation and release of Gi2 alpha-subunits from this fraction. In the present study we could show that pretreating neutrophils with GDPbetaS prevented the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced association of its receptor with a cytoskeletal fraction and also blocked the release of Gi2 alpha-subunits from the same cytoskeletal fraction. In contrast, direct activation of Gi2 proteins by addition of GTPgammaS or AlF4- not only caused a release of Gi2 alpha-subunits from the cytoskeleton but also an association of formyl peptide receptors with the cytoskeleton. The receptor for complement fragment 5a, which transduces its signaling through the same Gi2 protein, triggers both a release of Gi2 alpha-subunits from the cytoskeleton fraction and, of even greater interest, an association between formyl peptide receptors and the cytoskeleton. The close relationship between the activation and release of Gi2 alpha-subunits from the cytoskeleton and the association of formyl peptide receptors with the cytoskeleton might, however, not be a matter of protein-protein exchange, since the increased binding of formyl peptide receptors to the cytoskeleton occurs more rapidly than the release of Gi2 alpha-subunits from the cytoskeleton. The present findings suggest a possible mechanism for the initiation of formyl peptide receptor desensitization during neutrophil locomotion.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
18346467,Direct Thy-1/alphaVbeta3 integrin interaction mediates neuron to astrocyte communication.,"Thy-1 is an abundant neuronal glycoprotein of poorly defined function. We recently provided evidence indicating that Thy-1 clusters a beta3-containing integrin in astrocytes to induce tyrosine phosphorylation, RhoA activation and the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers. To date, the alpha subunit partner of beta3 integrin in DI TNC1 astrocytes is unknown. Similarly, the ability of neuronal, membrane-bound Thy-1 to trigger astrocyte signaling via integrin engagement remains speculation. Here, evidence that alphav forms an alphavbeta3 heterodimer in DI TNC1 astrocytes was obtained. In neuron-astrocyte association assays, the presence of either anti-alphav or anti-beta3 integrin antibodies reduced cell-cell interaction demonstrating the requirement of both integrin subunits for this association. Moreover, anti-Thy-1 antibodies blocked stimulation of astrocytes by neurons but not the binding of these two cell types. Thus, neuron-astrocyte association involved binding between molecular components in addition to the Thy-1-integrin; however, the signaling events leading to focal adhesion formation in astrocytes depended exclusively on the latter interaction. Additionally, wild-type (RLD) but not mutated (RLE) Thy-1 was shown to directly interact with alphavbeta3 integrin by Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis. This interaction was promoted by divalent cations and was species-independent. Together, these results demonstrate that the alphavbeta3 integrin heterodimer interacts directly with Thy-1 present on neuronal cells to stimulate astrocytes.",,
15231666,Directionally specific paracrine communication mediated by epithelial FGF9 to stromal FGFR3 in two-compartment premalignant prostate tumors.,"Tissue homeostasis in normal prostate and two-compartment nonmalignant prostate tumors depends on harmonious two-way communications between epithelial and stromal compartments. Within the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, signaling to an epithelial cell-specific FGF receptor (FGFR) 2IIIb-heparan sulfate complex from stromal-specific FGF7 and FGF10 delivers directionally specific instruction from stroma to epithelium without autocrine interference. Using a two-compartment transplantable prostate tumor model in which survival of stromal cells in vivo depends on epithelial cells, we show that signaling from epithelial FGF9 to stromal FGFR3 potentially mediates epithelial-to-stromal communication that also is directionally specific. FGF9 mRNA was expressed exclusively in the epithelial cells derived from well-differentiated, two-compartment Dunning R3327 rat prostate tumors. In contrast, FGFR3 was expressed at functionally significant levels only in the derived stromal cells. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation assays revealed that FGF9 only bound to an FGFR on the stromal cells. FGF9 also failed to covalently cross-link to clonal lines of stromal cells devoid of FGFR3 that expressed FGFR1 and FGFR2IIIc. Furthermore, FGF9 specifically stimulated DNA synthesis in stromal cells expressing FGFR3. These results demonstrate a directionally specific paracrine signaling from epithelial FGF9 and stromal FGFR3. Similar to the FGF7/FGF10 to FGFR2IIIb signaling from the stroma to the epithelium, the directional specificity from epithelium to stroma appears set by a combination of cell-specific expression of isoforms and cell-context specificity of FGFR isotypes for FGF.",Cancer research,2004
8940121,Discrete steps in binding and signaling of interleukin-8 with its receptor.,"The mechanisms by which chemokines bind and signal through their receptors are complex and poorly understood. In the present study, we sought to dissect these processes and to map important functional domains of the two CXC chemokine (interleukin-8) receptors, CXCR1 (formally IL-8RA) and CXCR2 (formally IL-8RB), using blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the receptors and a series of chimeras between CXCR1 and CXCR2. A panel of specific mAbs against CXCR1 or CXCR2, generated by immunizing mice with transfectants expressing either receptor, were shown to effectively block IL-8- and/or growth-related oncogene alpha (GROalpha) -mediated ligand binding, chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding in CXCR1 and CXCR2 transfectants and/or human neutrophils. Of particular interest was an anti-CXCR1 mAb, 7D9, that inhibited chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding but had no detectable effects on ligand binding. The epitopes of these blocking mAbs were mapped by using a series of CXCR1/2 chimera transfectants and synthetic peptides. Most of the anti-CXCR1 antibodies, except 7D9, mapped to the amino acid sequence WDFDDL (CXCR1 residues 10-15), and all the anti-CXCR2 antibodies mapped to the amino acid sequence FEDFW (CXCR2 residues 6-10). The epitope of mAb 7D9 mainly involved a region within the first 45 residues of CXCR1, and it appeared to be conformation-sensitive. These results support a model in which the binding and signaling of IL-8 with its receptor occur in at least two discrete steps involving distinct domains of the receptor. This model is consistent with the notion that discrete conformational changes of the receptor secondary to ligand binding are required to trigger various biological responses. Moreover, the ligand binding and chemotaxis properties of each CXCR1/2 chimeric receptor to IL-8 and GROalpha were determined. It was found that each is distinct in its ability to confer ligand binding and chemotactic response to IL-8 and GROalpha, and two conclusions could be made. 1) The N-terminal segment of CXCR1 is a dominant determinant of receptor subtype selectivity, consistent with previous studies using rabbit/human CXCR1/2 chimeras; and 2) the specificity determinant for GROalpha binding in CXCR2 involves sequences in the N terminus, distal to the first 15 residues, as well as other parts of the receptor.",,
16601240,Dissection of the hyperadhesive phenotype of airway eosinophils in asthma.,"Asthma is characterized by appearance of eosinophils in the airway. Eosinophils purified from the airway 48 h after segmental antigen challenge are described as exhibiting greater adhesion to albumin-coated surfaces via an unidentified beta2 integrin and increased expression of alphaMbeta2 (CD11b/18) compared with purified blood eosinophils. We have investigated the determinants of this hyperadhesive phenotype. Airway eosinophils exhibited increased reactivity with the CBRM1/5 anti-alphaM activation-sensitive antibody as well as enhanced adhesion to VCAM-1 (CD106) and diverse ligands, including albumin, ICAM-1 (CD54), fibrinogen, and vitronectin. Purified blood eosinophils did not adhere to the latter diverse ligands. Enhanced adhesion of airway eosinophils was blocked by anti-alphaMbeta2. Podosomes, structures implicated in cell movement and proteolysis of matrix proteins, were larger and more common on airway eosinophils adherent to VCAM-1 when compared with blood eosinophils. Incubation of blood eosinophils with IL-5 replicated the phenotype of airway eosinophils. That is, IL-5 enhanced recognition of alphaM by CBRM1/5; stimulated alphaMbeta2-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1, albumin, ICAM-1, fibrinogen, and vitronectin; and increased podosome formation on VCAM-1. Thus, the hyperadhesion of airway eosinophils after antigen challenge is mediated by upregulated and activated alphaMbeta2.",,
9289016,"Distinct but overlapping epitopes for the interaction of a CC-chemokine with CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5.","Chemokines play an important role in inflammation. The mechanism via which they bind to more than one receptor and activate them is not well understood. The chemokines are thought to interact with their receptors via two distinct sites, one necessary for binding and the other for activation of signal transduction. In this study we have used alanine scanning mutagenesis to identify residues on RANTES that specifically interact with its receptors CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 for binding and activation. Residues within a potential receptor binding site known as the N-loop (residues 12-20) and near the N-terminus of RANTES were individually mutated to alanine. The results of this study show that, within the N-loop, the side chain of R17 is necessary for RANTES binding to CCR1, F12 for binding to CCR3, and F12 and I15 for binding to CCR5, thus forming distinct but overlapping binding epitopes. In addition, our finding that P2 is necessary for binding to CCR5 is the first to show that a residue near the N-terminus of a CC-chemokine is involved in binding to a receptor. We have also found that P2, D6, and T7 near the N-terminus are involved in activating signal transduction via CCR1, P2 and Y3 via CCR3, and Y3 and D6 via CCR5. These results indicate that RANTES interacts with each of its receptors in a distinct and specific manner and provide further evidence to support the two-site model of interaction between chemokines and their receptors.",,
11423542,Distinct ligand-binding modes for integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion to fibronectin versus vitronectin.,"Cell surface integrins can adopt distinct conformations in response to ligand binding and intracellular signals. Several integrins including alpha(v)beta(3) can bind to multiple ligands. The binding of alpha(v)beta(3) to fibronectin and vitronectin was used as a model to determine whether the same or distinct forms of the receptor were utilized in strong binding to the two different ligands. A spinning-disc device was used to measure the relative strength of the alpha(v)beta(3)-ligand bonds. The initial binding reaction for both ligands occurred in the absence of metabolic energy and resulted in a strong adhesion to fibronectin but a weak adhesion to vitronectin. Increases in the strength of the alpha(v)beta(3)-vitronectin bond required phosphorylation of the beta(3) cytoplasmic domain, intracellular signals, and the binding of cytoskeletal proteins to cytoplasmic domains of beta(3) controlled by Tyr-747 and Tyr-759. In contrast, alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion to fibronectin was unaffected by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, mutations of Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 to phenylalanine, or availability of metabolic energy. This suggests that strong adhesion to fibronectin used the initial binding conformation, whereas strong binding to vitronectin required signaling-induced changes in the conformation of alpha(v)beta(3).",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
15520004,Distinct molecular mechanisms for agonist peptide binding to types A and B cholecystokinin receptors demonstrated using fluorescence spectroscopy.,"Fluorescence spectroscopy provides a direct method for evaluating the environment of a fluorescent ligand bound to its receptor. We utilized this methodology to determine the environment of Alexa within a cholecystokinin (CCK)-like probe (Alexa488-Gly-[(Nle(28,31))CCK-26-33]; CCK-8 probe) bound to the type A CCK receptor (Harikumar, K. G., Pinon, D. L., Wessels, W. S., Prendergast, F. G., and Miller, L. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 18552-18560). Here, we study this probe at the type B CCK receptor and develop another probe with its fluorophore closer to the carboxyl-terminal pharmacophore of type B receptor ligands (Alexa488-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2; CCK-4 probe). Both probes bound to type B CCK receptors in a saturable and specific manner and represented full agonists. Similar to the type A receptor, at the type B receptor these probes exhibited shorter lifetimes and lower anisotropy when the receptor was in the active conformation than when it was shifted to its inactive, G protein-uncoupled state using guanosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]-triphosphate trisodium salt. Absolute values for lifetime and anisotropy were lower for the CCK-8 probe bound to the type B receptor than for this probe bound to the type A receptor, and Alexa fluorescence was more easily quenched by iodide at the type B receptor. This represents the first direct evidence that, despite having identical affinities for binding and potencies for activating type A and B receptors, CCK is docked via distinct mechanisms, with the amino terminus more exposed to the aqueous milieu when bound to the type B CCK receptor than to the type A CCK receptor. Of interest, despite this difference in binding, activation of both receptors results in analogous direction of movement of the fluorescent indicator probes.",,
16531504,Distinct receptor activity-modifying protein domains differentially modulate interaction with calcitonin receptors.,"Calcitonin receptors (CTRs) dimerize with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) to generate high-affinity amylin (AMY) receptors; however, the relative contribution of individual RAMP domains to the formation of AMY receptors is poorly understood. We have used chimeras between RAMP1 and RAMP2 that specifically exchanged the N-terminal, transmembrane, or C-terminal domain and examined these in assays of [(125)I]amylin binding or peptide-induced cAMP signaling in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with wild-type or chimeric RAMPs and human CTRa. The specificity of peptides in competition for [(125)I]amylin binding was principally dictated by the N-terminal domain present in the chimeras; however, the maximal level of binding induced was dictated by the transmembrane domain present. This extended previous data (Zumpe et al., 2000) to provide a distinction between the transmembrane domain and the C terminus in this function. In contrast to the effects on binding, each of the RAMP domains played a role in the signaling phenotype of the receptors. In particular, the potency of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was most influenced by the C-terminal domain present, in which the presence of the RAMP1 C-terminal domain led to increased potency over CTRa alone, whereas chimeras with the RAMP2 C-terminal domain did not induce increased CGRP potency. The data provide additional support for the importance of the N terminus in determining binding affinity but reveal a prominent role of the transmembrane domain in the strength of amylin binding and a unique role for the C terminus in signaling by peptides to stimulate cAMP production.",Molecular pharmacology,2006
12606634,Distinct recognition of OX1 and OX2 receptors by orexin peptides.,"In this study, we have compared the abilities of orexin-A and orexin-B and variants of orexin-A to activate different Ca(2+) responses (influx and release) in human OX(1) and OX(2) receptor- expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. Responses mediated by activation of both receptor subtypes with either orexin-A or -B were primarily dependent on extracellular Ca(2+), suggesting similar activation of Ca(2+) influx as we have previously shown for orexin-A and OX(1) receptors. Amino acid-wise truncation of orexin-A reduced its ability to activate OX(1) and OX(2) receptors, but the response mediated by the OX(2) receptor was more resistant to truncation than the response mediated by the OX(1) receptor. We also performed a sequential replacement of amino acids 14 to 26 with alanine in the truncated orexin-A variant orexin-A(14-33). Replacement of the same amino acids produced a fall in the potency for each receptor subtype, but the reduction was less prominent for the OX(2) receptor. The most marked reduction was produced by the replacement of Leu20, Asp25, and His26 with alanine. Interestingly, extracellular Ca(2+) dependence of responses to some of the mutated peptides was different from those of orexin-A and -B. The mutagenesis also suggests that although the determinants required from orexin-A for binding to and activation of the receptor are highly conserved between the orexin receptor subtypes, the OX(2) receptor requires fewer determinants. This might in part explain why orexin-B has the affinity and potency equal to orexin-A for this subtype, although it has 10- to 100-fold lower affinity and potency for the OX(1) receptor.",,
10193788,Distinction between surmountable and insurmountable selective AT1 receptor antagonists by use of CHO-K1 cells expressing human angiotensin II AT1 receptors.,"1. CHO-K1 cells that were stably transfected with the gene for the human AT1 receptor (CHO-AT1 cells) were used for pharmacological studies of non-peptide AT1 receptor antagonists. 2. In the presence of 10 mM LiCl, angiotensin II caused a concentration-dependent and long-lasting increase of inositol phosphates accumulation with an EC50 of 3.4 nM. No angiotensin II responses are seen in wild-type CHO-K1 cells. 3. [3H]-Angiotensin II bound to cell surface AT1 receptors (dissociates under mild acidic conditions) and is subject to rapid internalization. 4. Non-peptide selective AT1 antagonists inhibited the angiotensin II (0.1 microM) induced IP accumulation and the binding of [3H]-angiotensin II (1 nM) with the potency order: candesartan > EXP3174 > irbesartan > losartan. Their potencies are lower in the presence of bovine serum albumin. 5. Preincubation with the insurmountable antagonist candesartan decreased the maximal angiotensin II induced inositol phosphate accumulation up to 94% and, concomitantly, decreased the maximal binding capacity of the cell surface receptors. These inhibitory effects were half-maximal for 0.6 nM candesartan and were attenuated by simultaneous preincubation with 1 microM losartan indicating a syntopic action of both antagonists. 6. Losartan caused a parallel rightward shift of the angiotensin II concentration-response curves and did not affect the maximal binding capacity. EXP3174 (the active metabolite of losartan) and irbesartan showed a mixed-type behavior in both functional and binding studies. 7. Reversal of the inhibitory effect was slower for candesartan as compared with EXP3174 and irbesartan and it was almost instantaneous for losartan, suggesting that the insurmountable nature of selective AT1 receptor antagonists in functional studies was related to their long-lasting inhibition.",British journal of pharmacology,1999
9082970,Distribution and functional significance of the endothelin receptor subtypes in the rat adrenal gland.,"Endothelins (ET) are a family of vasoactive peptides that act via two subtypes of receptors, named ETA and ETB. ET-1 binds to both ETA and ETB, whereas the isopeptide ET-3 preferentially binds to ETB. The localization of ETA and ETB receptors in the rat adrenal gland and their involvement in the adrenal secretagogue effect of ETs has been studied in vitro. Autoradiographic assessment of the selective displacement of [125I]ET-1, [125I]ET-3 and [125I]BQ-3020 (an ETB agonist) by BQ-123 or BQ-788 (specific antagonists of ETA and ETB, respectively) indicates that the zona glomerulosa and adrenal medulla possess both ETA and ETB, whereas the zona fasciculata/reticularis is exclusively provided with ETB. ET-1, ET-3 and BQ-3020 enhance aldosterone and corticosterone secretion by dispersed cells of the zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata/reticularis, respectively. BQ-123 does not affect the secretagogue action of these three agonists, whereas BQ-788 completely annuls it. ET-1 induces a marked rise in catecholamine release by fragments of the adrenal medulla, and both BQ-123 and BQ-788 partially reverse this effect. ET-3 and BQ-3020 elicit a catecholamine release that is less intense than that produced by ET-1; this response is unaffected by BQ-123 and abolished by BQ-788. Thus, in the rat, the corticosteroid secretagogue effect of ETs seems to be exclusively mediated by the ETB receptor subtype, and the catecholamine secretagogue action by both ETA and ETB. The functional relevance of ETA receptors present in the zona glomerulosa remains to be investigated.",,
12454284,Disulfide bond-mediated dimerization of HLA-G on the cell surface.,"HLA-G is a nonclassical class I MHC molecule with an unknown function and with unusual characteristics that distinguish it from other class I MHC molecules. Here, we demonstrate that HLA-G forms disulfide-linked dimers that are present on the cell surface. Immunoprecipitation of HLA-G from surface biotinylated transfectants using the anti-beta2-microglobulin mAb BBM.1 revealed the presence of an approximately equal 78-kDa form of HLA-G heavy chain that was reduced by using DTT to a 39-kDa form. Mutation of Cys-42 to a serine completely abrogated dimerization of HLA-G, suggesting that the disulfide linkage formed exclusively through this residue. A possible interaction between the HLA-G monomer or dimer and the KIR2DL4 receptor was also investigated, but no interaction between these molecules could be detected through several approaches. The cell-surface expression of dimerized HLA-G molecules may have implications for HLA-Greceptor interactions and for the search for specific receptors that bind HLA-G.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2002
21702718,"Divergent activities of osteogenic BMP2, and tenogenic BMP12 and BMP13 independent of receptor binding affinities.","Ectopic expression of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP2) induces osteogenesis, while ectopic expression of rhBMP12 and rhBMP13 induces the formation of tendon-like tissue. Despite their different in vivo activities, all three ligands bound to the type I bone morphogenic protein receptors (BMPRs), activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-3 and ALK6, and to the type II BMPRs, activin receptor type-2A, activin receptor type-2B, and BMPR2, with similar affinities. Treatment of C3H10T1/2 cells with rhBMP2 activated SMAD signaling and induced expression of osteoblast markers including osteocalcin mRNA (Ocn). In contrast, treatment with rhBMP12 or rhBMP13 resulted in a dose-dependent induction of a tendon-specific gene (Thbs4) expression with no detectable activation of SMAD 1, 5, and 8. Differential regulation of Thbs4 and Ocn has potential utility as an in vitro biomarker for induction of tenogenic signaling. Such an assay also permits the ability to distinguish between the activities of different BMPs and may prove useful in studies on the molecular mechanisms of BMP tenogenic activity.","Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",2011
11449371,"Diverging binding capacities of natural LD78beta isoforms of macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha to the CC chemokine receptors 1, 3 and 5 affect their anti-HIV-1 activity and chemotactic potencies for neutrophils and eosinophils.","Recently, the LD78beta isoform of the CC chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha was shown to efficiently chemoattract lymphocytes and monocytes and to inhibit infection of mononuclear cells by R5 HIV-1 strains. We have now demonstrated that after cleavage of the NH2-terminal Ala-Pro dipeptide by CD26, LD78beta(3 - 70) became the most potent chemokine blocking HIV-1. LD78beta(3 - 70) competed tenfold more efficiently than LD78beta(1 - 70) with [125I] RANTES for binding to the CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR1. Contrary to LD78alpha, LD78beta(1 - 70) at 30 ng/ml efficiently competed with [125I] RANTES for binding to CCR3 and mobilized calcium in CCR3 transfectants, whereas LD78beta(3 - 70) showed a 30-fold decrease in CCR3 affinity compared to LD78beta(1 - 70). This demonstrates the importance of the penultimate proline in LD78beta(1 - 70) for CCR3 recognition. Both LD78beta isoforms efficiently chemoattracted eosinophils from responsive donors. In contrast, only the CCR3 agonist LD78beta(1 - 70) and not LD78beta(3 - 70), induced calcium increases in eosinophils with low levels of CCR1. In responder neutrophils, LD78beta(3 - 70) elicited calcium fluxes at a 30-fold lower dose (10 ng/ml) compared to intact LD78beta and LD78alpha, whereas the three MIP-1alpha isoforms were equipotent neutrophil chemoattractants. Taken together, both LD78beta isoforms are potent HIV-1 inhibitors (CCR5) and activators for neutrophils (CCR1) and eosinophils (CCR1, CCR3), affecting infection and inflammation.",,

12950167,Domains of apoE required for binding to apoE receptor 2 and to phospholipids: implications for the functions of apoE in the brain.,"We have studied the contribution of the carboxy terminal domains of lipid-free apoE isolated from apoE-expressing cell cultures in binding to phospholipids and have determined the affinities of reconstituted POPC-apoE particles for the apoER2. It was found that the initial rate of association of apoE2, apoE3, apoE4, and a mutant form apoE4R158M to multilamellar DMPC vesicles was similar and was reduced and eventually diminished by gradual deletion of the carboxy terminal segments. The truncated apoE forms retained their ability to associate with plasma lipoproteins. Receptor binding studies were performed using the ldlA-7 cells expressing apoER2 and transiently transfected COS-M6 and the appropriate control untransfected cells. Specific binding to apoER2 was obtained by subtracting from the total binding to the receptor-expressing cells the nonspecific binding values of the untransfected cells. POPC-apoE particles generated using apoE3, apoE4, the truncated apoE4-259, apoE4-229, apoE4-202, and apoE-165, and the mutant apoE4R158M all bound tightly to the apoER2 (K(d) range of 12 +/- 3 to 19 +/- 4 microg/mL). POPC-apoE2 bound with reduced affinity (K(d) = 31 +/- 5.3 microg/mL). The findings establish that the apoER2 binding domain of apoE is in the 1-165 amino terminal region, whereas the carboxy terminal 230-299 region of apoE is required for efficient initial association with phospholipids.",,
7932753,Domains of interaction between alpha interferon and its receptor components.,"We describe how constraints on the binding of human interferons (IFNs), alpha1 and alpha2 and alpha8 on mouse cells are partially relieved by the expression of the bovine (Bo) or human (Hu) IFN alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR) component in these cells. We show that, while the binding of all three is substantially increased by the transfection of Bo IFNAR, it is accompanied by an increase in activity only in the case of alpha2 and alpha8 (IFNs that otherwise have little activity on mouse cells). IFN alpha1, which shows some partial activity on mouse cells, responds to the presence of Bo IFNAR by acting, at low concentrations, as a competitive antagonist to IFNs alpha2 and alpha8. A review of published results on IFN hybrid scanning and on the effects of expressing Bo IFNAR in human cells led us to propose that an N-terminal segment of the IFN molecule interacts directly with IFNAR. Applying site-directed mutagenesis to an IFN hybrid; alpha8[60]alpha1[92]alpha8, we show that the point mutations K84 to E84 and Y90 to D90 act synergistically to cause the hybrid to behave as the parental IFN alpha8, switching the preference from Mu to Hu IFNAR in transfected mouse cells. The published structural models for IFN reveal that positions 84 and 90 span the exposed residues of the alpha-helix C of the IFN molecule. We derive a model of IFN-receptor interaction in which the A helix and the C helix of IFN interact with IFNAR and in which a binding phase can be distinguished from a binding/activity phase. We propose that the so-called ""hot"" domains of the IFN molecule (the AB loop and the D helix) are presented by IFNAR to interact with an additional component of the functional receptor.",Journal of molecular biology,1994
15671031,"DRAGON, a bone morphogenetic protein co-receptor.","Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)beta superfamily of ligands that regulate many crucial aspects of embryonic development and organogenesis. Unlike other TGFbeta ligands, co-receptors for BMP ligands have not been described. Here we show that DRAGON, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored member of the repulsive guidance molecule family, which is expressed early in the developing nervous system, enhances BMP but not TGFbeta signaling. DRAGON binds directly to BMP2 and BMP4 but not to BMP7 or other TGFbeta ligands. The enhancing action of DRAGON on BMP signaling is also reduced by administration of Noggin, a soluble BMP antagonist, indicating that the action of DRAGON is ligand-dependent. DRAGON associates directly with BMP type I (ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6) and type II (ActRII and ActRIIB) receptors, and its signaling is reduced by dominant negative Smad1 and ALK3 or -6 receptors. In the Xenopus embryo, DRAGON both reduces the threshold of the ability of Smad1 to induce mesodermal and endodermal markers and alters neuronal and neural crest patterning. The direct interaction of DRAGON with BMP ligands and receptors indicates that it is a BMP co-receptor that potentiates BMP signaling.",,
16093349,Dual interaction of JAM-C with JAM-B and alpha(M)beta2 integrin: function in junctional complexes and leukocyte adhesion.,"The junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) have been recently described as interendothelial junctional molecules and as integrin ligands. Here we show that JAM-B and JAM-C undergo heterophilic interaction in cell-cell contacts and that JAM-C is recruited and stabilized in junctional complexes by JAM-B. In addition, soluble JAM-B dissociates soluble JAM-C homodimers to form JAM-B/JAM-C heterodimers. This suggests that the affinity of JAM-C monomers to form dimers is higher for JAM-B than for JAM-C. Using antibodies against JAM-C, the formation of JAM-B/JAM-C heterodimers can be abolished. This liberates JAM-C from its vascular binding partner JAM-B and makes it available on the apical side of vessels for interaction with its leukocyte counter-receptor alpha(M)beta2 integrin. We demonstrate that the modulation of JAM-C localization in junctional complexes is a new regulatory mechanism for alpha(M)beta2-dependent adhesion of leukocytes.",,
8999038,Dual oncostatin M (OSM) receptors. Cloning and characterization of an alternative signaling subunit conferring OSM-specific receptor activation.,"Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine whose structural and functional features are similar to other members of the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines (IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), granulocyte colonystimulating factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1), many of which utilize gp130 as a common receptor subunit. A biologically active OSM receptor has been previously described that consists of a heterodimer of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and gp130. This LIFR.gp130 complex is also a functional receptor for LIF. We have cloned and characterized an alternative subunit (OSMRbeta) for an OSM receptor complex (a heterodimer of gp130 and OSMRbeta) that is activated by OSM but not by LIF. The signaling capability of specific receptor subunit combinations was analyzed by independent assays measuring cell proliferation or induction of acute phase protein synthesis. Our results demonstrate that both LIF and OSM cause tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the gp130.LIFR combination, but the gp130.OSMRbeta complex is activated by OSM only. OSM-induced cellular responses, initiated through low affinity binding to gp130, are mediated by two heterodimeric receptor complexes that utilize alternative signal transducing subunits that confer different cytokine specificities to the receptor complex.",,
17982057,Dual role of melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM)/CD146 in lymphocyte endothelium interaction: MCAM/CD146 promotes rolling via microvilli induction in lymphocyte and is an endothelial adhesion receptor.,"The melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM)/CD146 is expressed as two isoforms differing by their cytoplasmic domain (MCAM long (MCAM-l) and MCAM short (MCAM-s)). MCAM being expressed by endothelial cells and activated T cells, we analyzed its involvement in lymphocyte trafficking. The NK cell line NKL1 was transfected by MCAM isoforms and submitted to adhesion on both the endothelial cell monolayer and recombinant molecules under shear stress. MCAM-l transfection reduced rolling velocity and increased NKL1 adhesion on the endothelial cell monolayer and VCAM-1. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that MCAM-l induced microvilli formation and extension. In contrast, MCAM short or mock transfection had no effect on adhesion of NKL1 cells and microvilli formation. As shown by mutagenesis, serine 32 of the MCAM-l cytoplasmic tail, belonging to a putative protein kinase C phosphorylation site, was necessary for MCAM-l-actin cytoskeleton interaction and microvilli induction. Accordingly, chelerythrine chloride, a protein kinase C inhibitor, abolished MCAM-l-induced microvilli and rolling of MCAM-l-transfected NKL1 cells. Inhibition of adhesion under shear stress by anti-MCAM Abs suggested that both lymphoid MCAM-l and endothelial MCAM were also directly involved in lymphocyte endothelium interaction. MCAM-l-transfected NKL1 and activated CD4 T cells adhered to rMCAM under shear stress whereas anti-MCAM Ab treatment inhibited this process. Taken together, these data establish that MCAM is involved in the initial steps of lymphocyte endothelium interaction. By promoting the rolling on the inflammation marker VCAM-1 via microvilli induction and displaying adhesion receptor activity involving possible homophilic MCAM-l-MCAM-l interactions, MCAM might be involved in the recruitment of activated T cells to inflammation sites.",,
14977921,"Dual roles of Sema6D in cardiac morphogenesis through region-specific association of its receptor, Plexin-A1, with off-track and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2.","Semaphorins, originally identified as axon guidance facto s in the nervous system, play integral roles in organogenesis. Here, we demonstrate a critical involvement of Sema6D in cardiac morphogenesis. Ectopic expression of Sema6D o RNA interference against Sema6D induces expansion or narrowing of the ventricular chamber, respectively, during chick embryonic development. Sema6D also exerts region-specific activities on cardiac explants, a migration-promoting activity on outgrowing cells from the conotruncal segment, and a migration-inhibitory activity on those from the ventricle. Plexin-A1 mediates these activities as the major Sema6D-binding receptor. Plexin-A1 forms a receptor complex with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 in the conotruncal segment or with Off-track in the ventricle segment; these complexes are responsible for the effects of Sema6D on the respective regions. Thus, the differential association of Plexin-A1 with additional receptor components entitles Sema6D to exert distinct biological activities at adjacent regions. This is crucial for complex cardiac morphogenesis.",,
10598579,"Dual signaling of human Mel1a melatonin receptors via G(i2), G(i3), and G(q/11) proteins.","Mel 1a melatonin receptors belong to the super-family of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein)-coupled receptors. So far, interest in Mel 1a receptor signaling has focused mainly on the modulation of the adenylyl cyclase pathway via pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins. To further investigate signaling of the human Mel 1a receptor, we have developed an antibody directed against the C terminus of this receptor. This antibody detected the Mel 1a receptor as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 60 kDa in immunoblots after separation by SDS-PAGE. It also specifically precipitated the 2-[125I]iodomelatonin (125I-Mel)-labeled receptor from Mel 1a-transfected HEK 293 cells. Coprecipitation experiments showed that G(i2), G(i3), and G(q/11) proteins couple to the Mel 1a receptor in an agonist-dependent and guanine nucleotide-sensitive manner. Coupling was selective since other G proteins present in HEK 293 cells, (G(i1), G(o), G(s), G(z), and G12) were not detected in receptor complexes. Coupling of the Mel 1a receptor to G(i) and G(q) was confirmed by inhibition of high-affinity 125I-Mel binding to receptors with subtype-selective G protein alpha-subunit antibodies. G(i2) and/or G(i3) mediated adenylyl cyclase inhibition while G(q/11) induced a transient elevation in cytosolic calcium concentrations in HEK 293 cells stably expressing Mel 1a receptors. Melatonin-induced cytosolic calcium mobilization via PTX-insensitive G proteins was confirmed in primary cultures of ovine pars tuberalis cells endogenously expressing Mel 1a receptors. In conclusion, we report the development of the first antibody recognizing the cloned human Mel 1a melatonin receptor protein. We show that Mel 1a receptors functionally couple to both PTX-sensitive and PTX-insensitive G proteins. The previously unknown signaling of Mel 1a receptors through G(q/11) widens the spectrum of potential targets for melatonin.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",1999
12734373,Duffy antigen facilitates movement of chemokine across the endothelium in vitro and promotes neutrophil transmigration in vitro and in vivo.,"The Duffy Ag expressed on RBCs, capillaries, and postcapillary venular endothelial cells binds selective CXC and CC chemokines with high affinity. Cells transfected with the Duffy Ag internalize but do not degrade chemokine ligand. It has been proposed that Duffy Ag transports chemokines across the endothelium. We hypothesized that Duffy Ag participates in the movement of chemokines across the endothelium and, by doing so, modifies neutrophil transmigration. We found that the Duffy Ag transfected into human endothelial cells facilitates movement of the radiolabeled CXC chemokine, growth related oncogene-alpha/CXC chemokine ligand 1 (GRO-alpha/CXCL1), across an endothelial monolayer. In addition, neutrophil migration toward GRO-alpha/CXCL1 and IL-8 (IL-8/CXCL8) was enhanced across an endothelial monolayer expressing the Duffy Ag. Furthermore, GRO-alpha/CXCL1 stimulation of endothelial cells expressing the Duffy Ag did not affect gene expression by oligonucleotide microarray analysis. These in vitro observations are supported by the finding that IL-8/CXCL8-driven neutrophil recruitment into the lungs was markedly attenuated in transgenic mice lacking the Duffy Ag. We conclude that Duffy Ag has a role in enhancing leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation by facilitating movement of chemokines across the endothelium.",,
25216363,Dynamic catch of a Thy-1-α5β1+syndecan-4 trimolecular complex.,"Cancer cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium is a critical step of tumour metastasis. Endothelial surface molecule Thy-1 (CD90) is implicated in the metastatic process through its interactions with integrins and syndecans. However, how Thy-1 supports cell-cell adhesion in a dynamic mechanical environment is not known. Here we show that Thy-1 supports β1 integrin- and syndecan-4 (Syn4)-mediated contractility-dependent mechanosignalling of melanoma cells. At the single-molecule level, Thy-1 is capable of independently binding α5β1 integrin and syndecan-4 (Syn4) receptors. However, in the presence of both α5β1 and Syn4, the two receptors bind cooperatively to Thy-1, to form a trimolecular complex. This trimolecular complex displays a unique phenomenon we coin 'dynamic catch', characterized by abrupt bond stiffening followed by the formation of catch bonds, where force prolongs the bond lifetime. Thus, we reveal a new class of trimolecular interactions where force strengthens the synergistic binding of two co-receptors and modulates downstream mechanosignalling.",,
9531566,Dynamic interaction of PTPmu with multiple cadherins in vivo.,"There is a growing body of evidence to implicate reversible tyrosine phosphorylation as an important mechanism in the control of the adhesive function of cadherins. We previously demonstrated that the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu associates with the cadherin-catenin complex in various tissues and cells and, therefore, may be a component of such a regulatory mechanism (Brady-Kalnay, S. M., D.L. Rimm, and N.K. Tonks. 1995. J. Cell Biol. 130:977- 986). In this study, we present further characterization of this interaction using a variety of systems. We observed that PTPmu interacted with N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and cadherin-4 (also called R-cadherin) in extracts of rat lung. We observed a direct interaction between PTPmu and E-cadherin after coexpression in Sf9 cells. In WC5 cells, which express a temperature-sensitive mutant form of v-Src, the complex between PTPmu and E-cadherin was dynamic, and conditions that resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin were associated with dissociation of PTPmu from the complex. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the COOH-terminal 38 residues of the cytoplasmic segment of E-cadherin was required for association with PTPmu in WC5 cells. Zondag et al. (Zondag, G., W. Moolenaar, and M. Gebbink. 1996. J. Cell Biol. 134: 1513-1517) have asserted that the association we observed between PTPmu and the cadherin-catenin complex in immunoprecipitates of the phosphatase arises from nonspecific cross-reactivity between BK2, our antibody to PTPmu, and cadherins. In this study we have confirmed our initial observation and demonstrated the presence of cadherin in immunoprecipitates of PTPmu obtained with three antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes in the phosphatase. In addition, we have demonstrated directly that the anti-PTPmu antibody BK2 that we used initially did not cross-react with cadherin. Our data reinforce the observation of an interaction between PTPmu and E-cadherin in vitro and in vivo, further emphasizing the potential importance of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating cadherin function.",,
14506282,Dysferlin interacts with annexins A1 and A2 and mediates sarcolemmal wound-healing.,"Mutations in the dysferlin gene cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy. We report here the results of expression profile analyses and in vitro investigations that point to an interaction between dysferlin and the Ca2+ and lipid-binding proteins, annexins A1 and A2, and define a role for dysferlin in Ca2+-dependent repair of sarcolemmal injury through a process of vesicle fusion. Expression profiling identified a network of genes that are co-regulated in dysferlinopathic mice. Co-immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy revealed that dysferlin normally associates with both annexins A1 and A2 in a Ca2+ and membrane injury-dependent manner. The distribution of the annexins and the efficiency of sarcolemmal wound-healing are significantly disrupted in dysferlin-deficient muscle. We propose a model of muscle membrane healing mediated by dysferlin that is relevant to both normal and dystrophic muscle and defines the annexins as potential muscular dystrophy genes.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
11309369,Ectodysplasin is released by proteolytic shedding and binds to the EDAR protein.,"Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) is an X-linked disorder characterized by abnormal development of ectoderm and its appendices. The EDA gene encodes different isoforms of ectodysplasin, a transmembrane protein. The two longest isoforms, ectodysplasin-A1 and -A2, which differ by an insertion of two amino acids, are trimeric type II membrane proteins with an extracellular portion containing a short collagenous domain and a TNF ligand motif in the C-terminal region. We show that ectodysplasin is released from cells to the culture medium. Deletion constructs were used to localize the cleavage site and show that the putative recognition sequence of a furin-like enzyme is needed for the cleavage. Some EDA patients have missense mutations affecting this recognition sequence, suggesting that cleavage has biological significance in vivo. EDAR, a recently cloned member of the TNFR family and the product of the downless gene, is able to co-precipitate ectodysplasin, confirming that they form a ligand-receptor pair. In situ hybridization and immunostaining studies show that ectodysplasin and EDAR are expressed in adjacent or partially overlapping layers in the developing human skin. We conclude that as a soluble ligand, ectodysplasin is able to interact with EDAR and mediate signals needed for the development of ectodermal appendages.",Human molecular genetics,2001
10908309,Edg2 receptor functionality: gialpha1 coexpression and fusion protein studies.,"Recombinant receptor cell lines are widely used in G-protein-coupled receptor selectivity studies. To unequivocally interpret the results of such studies, it is essential that the host cell line does not endogenously express the receptor of interest and in addition is unresponsive to the receptor's natural ligand. Here we describe an approach to overcome such difficulties associated with orphan receptors or, as in the present case, receptors whose endogenous ligand ubiquitously affects mammalian cells. The functional heterologous assay system described is for the hEdg2 receptor, which uses lysophosphatidic acid as its endogenous ligand. Once activated, this receptor mediates its effects via multiple secondary messenger pathways, including a Gi-coupled pathway. We have transiently expressed a pertussis toxin-insensitive hEdg2 receptor-ratGialpha1 fusion protein into human embryonic kidney cells and have monitored the ability of compounds to stimulate [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in membranes prepared from these cells after pretreatment with toxin. Because the assay conditions used favor Gi-mediated responses and because endogenous Gialpha subunits are rendered inactive, the response measured is, by definition, fusion protein-mediated. Consequently, we have developed an assay that monitors definitively Edg2 receptor-mediated responses in a mammalian cell line. A limited structure activity relationship study suggests that the lysophospholipid carbon chain has a role in receptor activation and in addition indicates that certain modifications to the phosphate group are tolerated.",Molecular pharmacology,2000

19804359,EFEMP1 binds the EGF receptor and activates MAPK and Akt pathways in pancreatic carcinoma cells.,"The EGF-related protein EFEMP1 (EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1) has been shown to promote tumor growth in human adenocarcinoma. To understand the mechanism of this action, the signal transduction activated upon treatment with this protein has been investigated. We show that EFEMP1 binds EGF receptor (EGFR) in a competitive manner relative to epidermal growth factor (EGF), implicating that EFEMP1 and EGF share the same or adjacent binding sites on the EGFR. Treatment of pancreatic carcinoma cells with purified EFEMP1 activates autophosphorylation of EGFR at the positions Tyr-992 and Tyr-1068, but not at the position Tyr-1048. This signal is further transduced to phosphorylation of Akt at position Thr-308 and p44/p42 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) at positions Thr-202 and Tyr-204. These downstream phosphorylation events can be inhibited by treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor PD 153035. The observed signal transduction upon treatment with EFEMP1 can contribute to the enhancement of tumor growth shown in pancreatic carcinoma cells overexpressing EFEMP1.",,
11401330,Effect of bone morphogenetic protein-6 on haemopoietic stem cells and cytokine production in normal human bone marrow stroma.,"Normal human bone marrow stroma cells include stem cells for both haemopoietic and osteochondrogenic lineages and express both bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I and type II receptors. As a member of the TGF-beta super-family, BMP-6 binds to both BMP type I and type II receptors and is involved in the developmental processes of renal and hepatic systems as well as of human foetal intestine. Also, BMP-6 induces osteoblastic differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells and is an autocrine stimulator of chondrocyte differentiation. The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of BMP-6 on human cobblestone-area-forming cells (CAFC), that represent the functional primitive repopulating haemopoietic stem cell in long-term bone marrow culture. Also, the effect of BMP-6 on marrow stroma production of interleukin-6, -11 and their common receptor gp130 that is expressed in haemopoietic stem cells and is indispensable for their proliferation and tri-lineage differentiation was examined. Moreover, the effect of BMP-6 on marrow stroma release of soluble adhesion molecule VCAM-1 mediating the primitive haemopoietic stem cell adhesion to marrow stroma was examined. The number of CAFC was significantly reduced after BMP-6 treatment from 88+/-10 per 10(5)cells in control cultures in a dose dependent manner to only 48+/-3 per 10(5)cells in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated cultures, P< 0.01. Quantitative ELISA measurement revealed 50 ng/ml BMP-6 was able to significantly reduce IL-6 and IL-11 production from marrow stroma, P< 0.01. Also, BMP-6 significantly increased soluble gp130 release by 7.4-fold in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated marrow stroma cultures. The profound rapid increase in this natural antagonist of human IL-6 cytokine family may reduce the gp130 signaling. Also, the soluble VCAM-1 released increased by two-fold in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated marrow stroma cultures. The marked increase in the soluble form may exert an antagonist effect on the function of VCAM-1 (ligand for VLA4). Recently, blocking the VLA4/VCAM-1 adhesion pathway was shown to mobilise haemopoietic CD34 positive cells in normal individuals. Also, we previously observed a significantly lower expression of VLA4 (CD49d) on G-CSF-mobilised blood CD34 positive cells than on bone marrow CD34 positive cells before mobilisation in the same normal donors. Since BMP are currently being used in clinical trials for bone repair and fracture healing, the present results suggest a possible role for BMP-6 in mobilising CD34 positive cells for transplantation. Further in vitro tests are required to evaluate this potential mobilising role of BMP-6 in human long-term bone marrow culture.",,
12702704,Effects of orexin (hypocretin) on GIRK channels.,"Orexins (hypocretins) are recently discovered excitatory transmitters implicated in arousal and sleep. Yet, their ionic and signal transduction mechanisms have not been fully clarified. Here we show that orexins suppress G-protein-coupled inward rectifier (GIRK) channel activity, and this suppression is likely to lead to neuronal excitation. Cultured neurons from the locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus tuberomammillaris (TM) were used, as well as HEK293A cells transfected with GIRK1 and 2, either human orexin receptor type 1 (OX1R) or type 2 (OX2R), mu opioid receptor and GFP cDNAs. In GTPgammaS-loaded cells, orexin A (OXA, 3 microM) inhibited GIRK currents that had previously been activated by somatostatin (in LC cells), nociceptin (TM cells), or the mu opioid agonist DAMGO (HEK cells). In guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-loaded HEK cells, in which GIRK currents were not preactivated, OXA induced a biphasic response through both types of orexin receptors: an initial current increase and a subsequent decrease to below resting levels. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships revealed that both the OXA-induced and suppressed currents are inwardly rectifying with reversal potentials around EK. The OXA-induced initial current was partially pertussis toxin (PTX) sensitive and partially PTX insensitive, whereas the OXA-suppressed current was PTX insensitive. These data suggest that orexin receptors couple with more than one type of G-protein, including PTX-sensitive (such as Gi/o) and PTX-insensitive (such as Gq/11) G-proteins. The modulation of GIRK channels by orexins may be one of the cellular mechanisms for the regulation of brain nuclei (e.g., LC and TM) that are crucial for arousal, sleep, and appetite.",Journal of neurophysiology,2003
15781448,Effects of protein and gene transfer of the angiopoietin-1 fibrinogen-like receptor-binding domain on endothelial and vessel organization.,"The vessel-stabilizing effect of angiopoietin-1 (Ang1)/Tie2 receptor signaling is a potential target for pro-angiogenic therapies as well as anti-angiogenic inhibition of tumor growth. We explored the endothelial and vascular specific activities of the Ang1 monomer, i.e. dissociated from its state as an oligomer. A truncated monomeric Ang1 variant (i.e. DeltaAng1) containing the isolated fibrinogen-like receptor-binding domain of Ang1 was created and recombinantly produced in insect cells. DeltaAng1 ligated the Tie2 receptor without triggering its phosphorylation. Moreover, monomeric DeltaAng1 was observed to bind alpha(5)beta(1) integrin with similar affinity compared with Tie2. Unexpectedly, in vitro treatment of endothelial cells with DeltaAng1 showed some of the known effects of full-length Ang1, including inhibition of basal endothelial cell permeability and stimulation of cell adhesion as well as activation of MAPKs. Local treatment of the microvasculature of the developing chicken chorioallantoic membrane with the DeltaAng1 protein led to profound reduction of the mean vascular length density, thinning of vessels, and reduction of the number of vessel branching points. Similar effects were observed in side-by-side experiments with the recombinant full-length Ang1 protein. These effects of simplification of the vessel branching pattern were confirmed through local gene transfer with lentiviral particles encoding DeltaAng1 or full-length Ang1. Together, our findings suggest a potential use for exogenous Ang1 in reducing rather than increasing vascular density. Furthermore, we show that the isolated receptor-binding domain of Ang1 is capable of mediating some effects of full-length Ang1 independently of Tie2 phosphorylation, possibly through integrin ligation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2005
9058374,Effects of recombinant agouti-signaling protein on melanocortin action.,"Mouse agouti protein is a paracrine signaling molecule that has previously been demonstrated to be an antagonist of melanocortin action at several cloned rodent and human melanocortin receptors. In this study we report the effects of agouti-signaling protein (ASIP), the human homolog of mouse agouti, on the action of alpha-MSH or ACTH at the five known human melanocortin receptor subtypes (hMCR 1-5). When stably expressed in L cells (hMC1R, hMC3R, hMC4R, hMC5R) or in the adrenocortical cell line OS3 (hMC1R, hMC2R, hMC4R), purified recombinant ASIP inhibits the generation of cAMP stimulated by alpha-MSH (hMC1R, hMC3R, hMC4R, hMC5R) or by ACTH (hMC2R). However, dose-response and Schild analysis indicated that the degree of ASIP inhibition varied significantly among the receptor subtypes; ASIP is a potent inhibitor of the hMC1R, hMC2R, and hMC4R, but has relatively weak effects at the hMC3R and hMC5R. These analyses also indicated that the apparent mechanism of ASIP antagonism varied among receptor subtypes, with characteristics consistent with competitive antagonism observed only at the hMC1R, and more complex behavior observed at the other receptors. ASIP inhibition at these latter receptors, nonetheless, can be classified as surmountable (hMC3R, hMC4R and hMC5R) or nonsurmountable (hMC2R). Recombinant ASIP also inhibited binding of radiolabeled melanocortins, [125I-Nle4, D-Phe7] alpha-MSH and [125I-Phe2, Nle4]ACTH 1-24, to the hMCR 1-5 receptors, with a relative efficacy that paralleled the ability of ASIP to inhibit cAMP accumulation at the hMC1R, hMC2R, hMC3R, and hMC4R. These results provide new insight into the biochemical mechanism of ASIP action and suggest that ASIP may play an important role in modulating melanocortin signaling in humans.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",1997
12620237,EGF activates its receptor by removing interactions that autoinhibit ectodomain dimerization.,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is the prototype of the ErbB (HER) family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which regulate cell growth and differentiation and are implicated in many human cancers. EGF activates its receptor by inducing dimerization of the 621 amino acid EGF receptor extracellular region. We describe the 2.8 A resolution crystal structure of this entire extracellular region (sEGFR) in an unactivated state. The structure reveals an autoinhibited configuration, where the dimerization interface recently identified in activated sEGFR structures is completely occluded by intramolecular interactions. To activate the receptor, EGF binding must promote a large domain rearrangement that exposes this dimerization interface. This contrasts starkly with other RTK activation mechanisms and suggests new approaches for designing ErbB receptor antagonists.",Molecular cell,2003
28988771,EGFR Ligands Differentially Stabilize Receptor Dimers to Specify Signaling Kinetics.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) regulates many crucial cellular programs, with seven different activating ligands shaping cell signaling in distinct ways. Using crystallography and other approaches, we show how the EGFR ligands epiregulin (EREG) and epigen (EPGN) stabilize different dimeric conformations of the EGFR extracellular region. As a consequence, EREG or EPGN induce less stable EGFR dimers than EGF-making them partial agonists of EGFR dimerization. Unexpectedly, this weakened dimerization elicits more sustained EGFR signaling than seen with EGF, provoking responses in breast cancer cells associated with differentiation rather than proliferation. Our results reveal how responses to different EGFR ligands are defined by receptor dimerization strength and signaling dynamics. These findings have broad implications for understanding receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling specificity. Our results also suggest parallels between partial and/or biased agonism in RTKs and G-protein-coupled receptors, as well as new therapeutic opportunities for correcting RTK signaling output.",,
25639753,Elabela-apelin receptor signaling pathway is functional in mammalian systems.,"Elabela (ELA) or Toddler is a recently discovered hormone which is required for normal development of heart and vasculature through activation of apelin receptor (APJ), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), in zebrafish. The present study explores whether the ELA-APJ signaling pathway is functional in the mammalian system. Using reverse-transcription PCR, we found that ELA is restrictedly expressed in human pluripotent stem cells and adult kidney whereas APJ is more widely expressed. We next studied ELA-APJ signaling pathway in reconstituted mammalian cell systems. Addition of ELA to HEK293 cells over-expressing GFP-AJP fusion protein resulted in rapid internalization of the fusion receptor. In Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells over-expressing human APJ, ELA suppresses cAMP production with EC50 of 11.1 nM, stimulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation with EC50 of 14.3 nM and weakly induces intracellular calcium mobilization. Finally, we tested ELA biological function in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and showed that ELA induces angiogenesis and relaxes mouse aortic blood vessel in a dose-dependent manner through a mechanism different from apelin. Collectively, we demonstrate that the ELA-AJP signaling pathways are functional in mammalian systems, indicating that ELA likely serves as a hormone regulating the circulation system in adulthood as well as in embryonic development.",,

15621532,Endocardial and epicardial derived FGF signals regulate myocardial proliferation and differentiation in vivo.,"The epicardium regulates growth and survival of the underlying myocardium. This activity depends on intrinsic retinoic acid (RA) and erythropoietin signals. However, these signals do not act directly on the myocardium and instead are proposed to regulate the production of an unidentified soluble epicardial derived mitogen. Here, we show that Fgf9, Fgf16, and Fgf20 are expressed in the endocardium and epicardium and that RA can induce epicardial expression of Fgf9. Using knockout mice and an embryonic heart organ culture system, we show that endocardial and epicardial derived FGF signals regulate myocardial proliferation during midgestation heart development. We further show that this FGF signal is received by both FGF receptors 1 and 2 acting redundantly in the cardiomyoblast. In the absence of this signal, premature differentiation results in cellular hypertrophy and newborn mice develop a dilated cardiomyopathy. FGFs thus constitute all or part of the epicardial signal regulating myocardial growth and differentiation.",,

These structurally diverse ligands specifically interact directly with recombinant human ALXR demonstrated by specific radioligand binding and function as well as immunoprecipitation of PMN receptors. In addition, the combination of both ATL and ANXA1-derived peptides limited PMN infiltration and reduced production of inflammatory mediators (that is, prostaglandins and chemokines) in vivo. Together, these results indicate functional redundancies in endogenous lipid and peptide anti-inflammatory circuits that are spatially and temporally separate, where both ATL and specific ANXA1-derived peptides act in concert at ALXR to downregulate PMN recruitment to inflammatory loci.",,

Endoglin cannot bind ligands on its own and does not alter binding to the kinase receptors. It binds TGF-beta1 and -beta3 by associating with the TGF-beta type II receptor and interacts with activin-A and BMP-7 via activin type II receptors, ActRII and ActRIIB, regardless of which type I receptor partner is coexpressed. However, endoglin binds BMP-2 by interacting with the ligand binding type I receptors, ALK3 and ALK6. The formation of heteromeric signaling complexes was not altered by the presence of endoglin, although it was coprecipitated with these complexes. Endoglin did not interact with BMP-7 through complexes containing the BMP type II receptor, demonstrating specificity of its action. Our data suggest that endoglin is an accessory protein of multiple kinase receptor complexes of the TGF-beta superfamily.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
12889478,"Endoglycan, a member of the CD34 family, functions as an L-selectin ligand through modification with tyrosine sulfation and sialyl Lewis x.","During lymphocyte homing to secondary lymphoid organs and instances of inflammatory trafficking, the rolling of leukocytes on vascular endothelium is mediated by transient interactions between L-selectin on leukocytes and several carbohydrate-modified ligands on the endothelium. Most L-selectin ligands such as CD34 and podocalyxin present sulfated carbohydrate structures (6-sulfated sialyl Lewis x or 6-sulfo-sLex) as a recognition determinant within their heavily glycosylated mucin domains. We recently identified endoglycan as a new member of the CD34 family. We report here that endoglycan, like the two other members of this family (CD34 and podocalyxin) can function as a L-selectin ligand. However, endoglycan employs a different binding mechanism, interacting with L-selectin through sulfation on two tyrosine residues and O-linked sLex structures that are presented within its highly acidic amino-terminal region. Our analysis establishes striking parallels with PSGL-1, a leukocyte ligand that interacts with all three selectins, mediating leukocyte-endothelial, leukocyte-leukocyte, and platelet-leukocyte interactions. Since the distribution of endoglycan includes hematopoietic precursors and leukocyte subpopulations, in addition to endothelial cells, our findings suggest several potential settings for endoglycan-mediated adhesion events.",,
15240572,Endorepellin causes endothelial cell disassembly of actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions through alpha2beta1 integrin.,"Endorepellin, the COOH-terminal domain of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, inhibits several aspects of angiogenesis. We provide evidence for a novel biological axis that links a soluble fragment of perlecan protein core to the major cell surface receptor for collagen I, alpha2beta1 integrin, and provide an initial investigation of the intracellular signaling events that lead to endorepellin antiangiogenic activity. The interaction between endorepellin and alpha2beta1 integrin triggers a unique signaling pathway that causes an increase in the second messenger cAMP; activation of two proximal kinases, protein kinase A and focal adhesion kinase; transient activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and heat shock protein 27, followed by a rapid down-regulation of the latter two proteins; and ultimately disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. The end result is a profound block of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Because perlecan is present in both endothelial and smooth muscle cell basement membranes, proteolytic activity during the initial stages of angiogenesis could liberate antiangiogenic fragments from blood vessels' walls, including endorepellin.",,
12029087,Endostatin blocks vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated signaling via direct interaction with KDR/Flk-1.,"Endostatin, a fragment of collagen XVIII, is a potent anti-angiogenic protein, but the molecular mechanism of its action is not yet clear. We examined the effects of endostatin on the biological and biochemical activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Endostatin blocked VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR/Flk-1 and activation of ERK, p38 MAPK, and p125(FAK) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Endostatin also inhibited the binding of VEGF(165) to both endothelial cells and purified extracellular domain of KDR/Flk-1. Moreover, the binding of VEGF(121) to KDR/Flk-1 and VEGF(121)-stimulated ERK activation were blocked by endostatin. The direct interaction between endostatin and KDR/Flk-1 was confirmed by affinity chromatography. However, endostatin did not bind to VEGF. Our findings suggest that a direct interaction of endostatin with KDR/Flk-1 may be involved in the inhibitory function of endostatin toward VEGF actions and responsible for its potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities in vivo.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002

Specimens of the non-hypertrophy group were obtained from 6 patients who underwent total cystectomy under the diagnosis of bladder cancer and those of the hypertrophy group from 6 prostatic hypertrophy patients who underwent open prostatectomy. 125I-ET-1 bound to the prostate tissue with the KD value of 0.033 +/- 0.012 nM in the non-hypertrophy group and with the KD value of 0.035 +/- 0.012 nM in the hypertrophy group. 125I-ET-3 bound to the prostate tissue with the KD value of 0.023 +/- 0.011 nM in the non-hypertrophy group and with the KD value of 0.029 +/- 0.016 nM in the hypertrophy group. The KD values were not significantly different between the hypertrophy and non-hypertrophy groups. The KD values of 125I-ET-1 and 125I-ET-3 were similar. The Bmax values (fmol/mg protein) of 125I-ET-1 binding to the prostate tissue were 32.18 +/- 3.69 to the non-hypertrophy group and 85.66 +/- 20.65 to the hypertrophy group. The Bmax values (fmol/mg protein) of 125I-ET-3 binding to the prostate tissue were 27.48 +/- 5.25 to the non-hypertrophy group and 75.90 +/- 13.46 to the hypertrophy group. The Bmax values of both 125I-ET-1 and 125I-ET-3 were significantly higher in the hypertrophy group than in the non-hypertrophy group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,

14764606,Engineering an APRIL-specific B cell maturation antigen.,"B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member whose physiological role remains unclear. BCMA has been implicated as a receptor for both a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B cell-activating factor (BAFF), tumor necrosis factor ligands that bind to multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor and have been reported to play a role in autoimmune disease and cancer. The results presented herein provide a dual perspective analysis of BCMA binding to both APRIL and BAFF. First, we characterized the binding affinity of monomeric BCMA for its ligands; BAFF binding affinity (IC50 = 8 +/- 5 microm) is about 1000-fold reduced compared with the high affinity interaction of APRIL (IC50 = 11 +/- 3 nm). Second, shotgun alanine scanning of BCMA was used to map critical residues for either APRIL or BAFF binding. In addition to a previously described ""DXL"" motif (Gordon, N. C., Pan, B., Hymowitz, S. G., Yin, J., Kelley, R. F., Cochran, A. G., Yan, M., Dixit, V. M., Fairbrother, W. J., and Starovasnik, M. A. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 5977-5983), the alanine scanning results predicted four amino acid positions in BCMA (Tyr13, Ile22, Gln25, and Arg27) that could impart ligand specificity. Substitution of Tyr13 was tolerated for BAFF binding but not APRIL binding. Arg27 was required for high affinity binding to APRIL, whereas substitutions of this residue had minimal effect on affinity for BAFF. Further phage display experiments suggested the single mutations of I22K, Q25D, and R27Y as providing the greatest difference in APRIL versus BAFF binding affinity. Incorporation of the Q25D and R27Y substitutions into BCMA produced a dual specificity variant, since it has comparable binding affinity for both APRIL and BAFF, IC50 = 350 and 700 nm, respectively. Binding of the I22K mutant of monomeric BCMA to BAFF was undetectable (IC50 > 100 microm), but affinity for binding to APRIL was similar to wild-type BCMA. Based on these results, a BCMA-Fc fusion with the single I22K mutation was produced that binds APRIL, IC50 = 12 nm, and has no measurable affinity for BAFF. These results suggest that APRIL is the preferred ligand for BCMA and show that specificity can be further modified through amino acid substitutions.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2004
14697332,Enhanced adhesion of monocytes via reverse signaling triggered by decoy receptor 3.,"Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), a newly identified soluble protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, is a receptor for Fas ligand (FasL), LIGHT and TL1A. It has been demonstrated that DcR3 is frequently overexpressed by malignant tumors arising from lung, gastrointestinal tract, neuronal glia and virus-associated leukemia. Recently, we demonstrated that DcR3 is able to modulate the differentiation and activation of dendritic cells (DCs), and that DcR3-treated DCs skew naive T cell differentiation towards a Th2 phenotype. In this study, we further demonstrate that DcR3 is able to induce actin reorganization and enhance the adhesion of monocytes and THP-1 cells by activating multiple signaling molecules, such as protein kinase C (PKC), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src kinases. This provides the first evidence that the soluble DcR3, like other immobilized members of TNFR superfamily, is able to trigger 'reverse signaling' to modulate cell function.",Experimental cell research,2004
9743322,Enhanced anti-HIV-1 activity and altered chemotactic potency of NH2-terminally processed macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) imply an additional MDC receptor.,"Posttranslational processing of chemokines increases (IL-8) or decreases (monocyte chemotactic protein-1) their chemotactic potency. Macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) attracts monocytes, dendritic cells, activated lymphocytes, and NK cells and has reportedly anti-HIV-1 activity. Here we report that truncation of MDC by deletion of two NH2-terminal residues resulted in impaired binding to CC chemokine receptor (CCR)4, the only identified MDC receptor so far. Truncated MDC(3-69) failed to desensitize calcium mobilization by MDC(1-69) or thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), another CCR4 ligand. MDC(3-69) lacked HUT-78 T cell chemotactic activity but retained its capacity to attract monocytes and to desensitize chemotaxis. Compared with MDC(1-69), MDC(3-69) had weak but enhanced antiviral activity against M- and T-tropic HIV-1 strains. Furthermore, both MDC forms failed to signal through the orphan receptors Bonzo/STRL33 and BOB/GPR15 and to desensitize RANTES and stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 responses in CCR5-transfected and CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)4-transfected cells, respectively. These findings suggest that MDC recognizes another, yet unidentified, receptor. We conclude that minimal NH2-terminal truncation of MDC differentially affects its various immunologic functions.",,
10196235,"Enhancement of cell adhesion and spreading by a cartilage-specific noncollagenous protein, cartilage matrix protein (CMP/Matrilin-1), via integrin alpha1beta1.","Cartilage matrix protein (CMP; also known as matrilin-1), one of the major noncollagenous proteins in most cartilages, binds to aggrecan and type II collagen. We examined the effect of CMP on the adhesion of chondrocytes and fibroblasts using CMP-coated dishes. The CMP coating at 10-20 micrograms/ml enhanced the adhesion and spreading of rabbit growth plate, resting and articular chondrocytes, and fibroblasts and human epiphyseal chondrocytes and MRC5 fibroblasts. The effect of CMP on the spreading of chondrocytes was synergistically increased by native, but not heated, type II collagen (gelatin). The monoclonal antibody to integrin alpha1 or beta1 abolished CMP-induced cell adhesion and spreading, whereas the antibody to integrin alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, beta2, alpha5beta1, or alphaVbeta5 had little effect on cell adhesion or spreading. The antibody to integrin alpha1, but not to other subunits, coprecipitated 125I-CMP that was added to MRC5 cell lysates, indicating the association of CMP with the integrin alpha1 subunit. Unlabeled CMP competed for the binding to integrin alpha1 with 125I-CMP. These findings suggest that CMP is a potent adhesion factor for chondrocytes, particularly in the presence of type II collagen, and that integrin alpha1beta1 is involved in CMP-mediated cell adhesion and spreading. Since CMP is expressed almost exclusively in cartilage, this adhesion factor, unlike fibronectin or laminin, may play a special role in the development and remodeling of cartilage.",,
18195069,Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin acts as an alarmin to activate the TLR2-MyD88 signal pathway in dendritic cells and enhances Th2 immune responses.,"Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) is an eosinophil granule-derived secretory protein with ribonuclease and antiviral activity. We have previously shown that EDN can induce the migration and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we report that EDN can activate myeloid DCs by triggering the Toll-like receptor (TLR)2-myeloid differentiation factor 88 signaling pathway, thus establishing EDN as an endogenous ligand of TLR2. EDN activates TLR2 independently of TLR1 or TLR6. When mice were immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) together with EDN or with EDN-treated OVA-loaded DCs, EDN enhanced OVA-specific T helper (Th)2-biased immune responses as indicated by predominant production of OVA-specific interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13, as well as higher levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 than IgG2a. Based on its ability to serve as a chemoattractant and activator of DCs, as well as the capacity to enhance antigen-specific immune responses, we consider EDN to have the properties of an endogenous alarmin that alerts the adaptive immune system for preferential enhancement of antigen-specific Th2 immune responses.",,
11264152,Eotaxin is a natural antagonist for CCR2 and an agonist for CCR5.,"Eotaxin is a potent inducer of eosinophil chemotaxis and was considered as a selective ligand of the CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3), which is expressed on eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 lymphocytes. This study shows that eotaxin also interacts with CCR2 and CCR5 and can, thus, affect the responses of monocytes, which express both receptors. In human monocytes pretreatment with eotaxin decreased responsiveness to MCP-1, a selective ligand for CCR2, as well as to RANTES and MIP-1 beta, which bind to CCR5. Similar effects were obtained with transfected cells expressing CCR2 or CCR5, but here a difference became apparent: Eotaxin triggered CCR5 at a concentration of 100 nM but not CCR2 even at 1 microM, suggesting an antagonistic effect on this receptor. In agreement with this observation, eotaxin induced internalization of CCR5 but not of CCR2 in human monocytes and transfected cells. Binding studies showed that eotaxin displaces (125) I-MCP-1 from monocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, and functional experiments showed that eotaxin inhibits MCP-1-induced chemotaxis and enzyme release. The results demonstrate that eotaxin is a CCR5 agonist and a CCR2 antagonist. The present findings suggest a role of eotaxin in the fine-tuning of cellular responses occurring at sites of allergic inflammation, in which both MCP-1 and eotaxin are produced.

15039444,Eotaxin-3/CCL26 is a natural antagonist for CC chemokine receptors 1 and 5. A human chemokine with a regulatory role.,"Eotaxin-3 (CCL26), like eotaxin (CCL11) and eotaxin-2 (CCL24), has long been considered a specific agonist for CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3), attracting and activating eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 type T lymphocytes. Although not characterized extensively yet, its expression profile coincides with a potential role in allergic inflammation. We recently reported that eotaxin-3 is an antagonist for CCR2 (Ogilvie, P., Paoletti, S., Clark-Lewis, I., and Uguccioni, M. (2003) Blood 102, 789-784). In the present report, we provide evidence that eotaxin-3 acts as a natural antagonist on CCR1 and -5 as well. Eotaxin-3 bound to cells transfected with either CCR1 or -5 as well as to monocytes expressing both receptors. Further, it inhibited chemotaxis, the release of free intracellular calcium, and actin polymerization when cells were stimulated with known agonists of CCR1 and -5. An analysis of its three-dimensional structure indicated the presence of two distinct epitopes that may be involved in specific binding to CCR1, -2, -3, and -5. Taken together, our data thus indicate eotaxin-3 to be the first human chemokine that features broadband antagonistic activities, suggesting that it may have a modulatory rather than an inflammatory function. Further, eotaxin-3 may play an unrecognized role in the polarization of cellular recruitment by attracting Th2 lymphocytes as well as eosinophils and basophils via CCR3, while concomitantly blocking the recruitment of Th1 lymphocytes and monocytes via CCR1, -2, and -5.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2004
23484855,EpCAM is an endoderm-specific Wnt derepressor that licenses hepatic development.,"Mechanisms underlying cell-type-specific response to morphogens or signaling molecules during embryonic development are poorly understood. To learn how response to the liver-inductive Wnt2bb signal is achieved, we identify an endoderm-enriched, single transmembrane protein, epithelial-cell-adhesion-molecule (EpCAM), as an endoderm-specific Wnt derepressor in zebrafish. hi2151/epcam mutants exhibit defective liver development similar to prt/wnt2bb mutants. EpCAM directly binds to Kremen1 and disrupts the Kremen1-Dickkopf2 (Dkk2) interaction, which prevents Kremen1-Dkk2-mediated removal of Lipoprotein-receptor-related protein 6 (Lrp6) from the cell surface. These data lead to a model in which EpCAM derepresses Lrp6 and cooperates with Wnt ligand to activate Wnt signaling through stabilizing membrane Lrp6 and allowing Lrp6 clustering into active signalosomes. Thus, EpCAM cell autonomously licenses and cooperatively activates Wnt2bb signaling in endodermal cells. Our results identify EpCAM as the key molecule and its functional mechanism to confer endodermal cells the competence to respond to the liver-inductive Wnt2bb signal.",,
9751130,Eph receptor-ligand interactions are necessary for guidance of retinal ganglion cell axons in vitro.,"Previous results of an in vitro guidance test, the stripe assay, have demonstrated the presence of a repulsive axon guidance activity for temporal retinal axons in the posterior part of the vertebrate optic tectum. Ephrin-A5 and Ephrin-A2 are ligands for the EphA subfamily of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, which are expressed in overlapping gradients in the posterior part of the tectum. When recombinantly expressed, both proteins have been shown to guide retinal ganglion cell axons in the stripe assay. While these results suggest that Ephrin-A5 and Ephrin-A2 form part of the posterior repulsive guidance activity, they do not elucidate whether they are necessary components. Here we report that soluble forms of the ligands at nanomolar concentrations completely abolish this repulsive activity. Similar results were obtained with the soluble extracellular domain of EphA3, which is a receptor for Ephrin-A2 and Ephrin-A5, but not with the corresponding domain of EphB3, a receptor for the transmembrane class of Eph ligands. These experiments show that the repulsive axon guidance activity seen in the stripe assay is mediated by Ephrin-A ligands.",,
8755474,Eph receptors and ligands comprise two major specificity subclasses and are reciprocally compartmentalized during embryogenesis.,"We report that the many Eph-related receptor tyrosine kinases, and their numerous membrane-bound ligands, can each be grouped into only two major specificity subclasses. Receptors in a given subclass bind most members of a corresponding ligand subclass. The physiological relevance of these groupings is suggested by viewing the collective distributions of all members of a subclass. These composite distributions, in contrast with less informative patterns seen with individual members of the family, reveal that the developing embryo is subdivided into domains defined by reciprocal and apparently mutually exclusive expression of a receptor subclass and its corresponding ligands. Receptors seem to encounter their ligands only at the interface between these domains. This reciprocal compartmentalization implicates the Eph family in the formation of spatial boundaries that may help to organize the developing body plan.",Neuron,1996

12761826,EphA4 provides repulsive signals to developing cochlear ganglion neurites mediated through ephrin-B2 and -B3.,"The ephrins and Eph receptors make up two large families of bi-directional signaling molecules that are known to play a role in the development of the nervous system. Recently, expression of EphA4 in the developing cochlea was shown, with strong expression in cells lining the osseous spiral lamina (OSL) through which afferent dendrites must pass to reach the organ of Corti (OC). It was also demonstrated that ephrin-B2 and -B3, both of which are known to interact with EphA4, are expressed by spiral ganglion (SG) neurons. To investigate the functional role of EphA4 in the development of inner ear neurons, neonatal rat SG explants were cultured for 72 hours on uniformly coated surfaces or near stripes of EphA4/IgG-Fc-chimera. Control explants were cultured on or near IgG-Fc and EphA1/IgG-Fc-chimera. To assess the roles of ephrin-B2 and -B3 in EphA4 signaling, SG explants were cultured with or without anti-ephrin-B2 and/or -B3 blocking antibodies. Growth patterns of SG neurites at the border of EphA4 receptor stripes showed repulsion, characterized by turning, stopping and/or reversal. In the case of IgG-Fc and EphA1, the neurites grew straight onto the stripes. Treatment with either anti-ephrin-B2 or -B3 blocking antibodies significantly reduced the repulsive effect of an EphA4 stripe. Moreover, when both antibodies were used together, neurites crossed onto EphA4 stripes with no evidence of repulsion. The results suggest that EphA4 provides repulsive signals to SG neurites in the developing cochlea, and that ephrin-B2 and -B3 together mediate this response.",The Journal of comparative neurology,2003
22579729,EphB regulates L1 phosphorylation during retinocollicular mapping.,"Interaction of the cell adhesion molecule L1 with the cytoskeletal adaptor ankyrin is essential for topographic mapping of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons to synaptic targets in the superior colliculus (SC). Mice mutated in the L1 ankyrin-binding motif (FIGQY(1229)H) display abnormal mapping of RGC axons along the mediolateral axis of the SC, resembling mouse mutant phenotypes in EphB receptor tyrosine kinases. To investigate whether L1 functionally interacts with EphBs, we investigated the role of EphB kinases in phosphorylating L1 using a phospho-specific antibody to the tyrosine phosphorylated FIGQY(1229) motif. EphB2, but not an EphB2 kinase dead mutant, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of L1 at FIGQY(1229) and perturbed ankyrin recruitment to the membrane in L1-transfected HEK293 cells. Src family kinases mediated L1 phosphorylation at FIGQY(1229) by EphB2. Other EphB receptors that regulate medial-lateral retinocollicular mapping, EphB1 and EphB3, also mediated phosphorylation of L1 at FIGQY(1229). Tyrosine(1176) in the cytoplasmic domain of L1, which regulates AP2/clathrin-mediated endocytosis and axonal trafficking, was not phosphorylated by EphB2. Accordingly mutation of Tyr(1176) to Ala in L1-Y(1176)A knock-in mice resulted in normal retinocollicular mapping of ventral RGC axons. Immunostaining of the mouse SC during retinotopic mapping showed that L1 colocalized with phospho-FIGQY in RGC axons in retinorecipient layers. Immunoblotting of SC lysates confirmed that L1 was phosphorylated at FIGQY(1229) in wild type but not L1-FIGQY(1229)H (L1Y(1229)H) mutant SC, and that L1 phosphorylation was decreased in the EphB2/B3 mutant SC. Inhibition of ankyrin binding in L1Y(1229)H mutant RGCs resulted in increased neurite outgrowth compared to WT RGCs in retinal explant cultures, suggesting that L1-ankyrin binding serves to constrain RGC axon growth. These findings are consistent with a model in which EphB kinases phosphorylate L1 at FIGQY(1229) in retinal axons to modulate L1-ankyrin binding important for mediolateral retinocollicular topography.",Molecular and cellular neurosciences,2012
12223469,EphB1 associates with Grb7 and regulates cell migration.,"EphB1 is a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases that play important roles in diverse biological processes including nervous system development, angiogenesis, and neural synapsis formation and maturation. Grb7 is an adaptor molecule implicated in the regulation of cell migration. Here we report identification of an interaction between Grb7 and the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 by using Grb7 as a ""bait"" in a yeast two-hybrid screening. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to confirm the interaction of Grb7 with the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 as well as the full-length receptor in intact cells. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of Grb7 and requires tyrosine autophosphorylation of EphB1. Furthermore, Tyr-928 of EphB1 was identified as the primary binding site for Grb7. Stimulation of endogenous EphB1 in embryonal carcinoma P19 cells with its ligand ephrinB1 increased its association with Grb7, which is consistent with a role for the autophosphorylation of EphB1. We also found that EphB1 could phosphorylate Grb7 and mutation of either Tyr-928 or Tyr-594 to Phe decreased this activity. Finally, we show that EphB1 could stimulate fibroblast motility on extracellular matrix in a kinase-dependent manner, which also correlated with its association with Grb7. Consistent with this, co-expression of Grb7 with EphB1 further enhanced cell motility, whereas co-expression of the Grb7 SH2 domain abolished EphB1-stimulated cell migration. Together, our results identified a novel interaction between EphB1 with the adaptor molecule Grb7 and suggested that this interaction may play a role in the regulation of cell migration by EphB1.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
10366629,Ephrin-A binding and EphA receptor expression delineate the matrix compartment of the striatum.,"The striatum integrates limbic and neocortical inputs to regulate sensorimotor and psychomotor behaviors. This function is dependent on the segregation of striatal projection neurons into anatomical and functional components, such as the striosome and matrix compartments. In the present study the association of ephrin-A cell surface ligands and EphA receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) with the organization of these compartments was determined in postnatal rats. Ephrin-A1 and ephrin-A4 selectively bind to EphA receptors on neurons restricted to the matrix compartment. Binding is absent from the striosomes, which were identified by mu-opioid receptor immunostaining. In contrast, ephrin-A2, ephrin-A3, and ephrin-A5 exhibit a different mosaic binding pattern that appears to define a subset of matrix neurons. In situ hybridization for EphA RTKs reveals that the two different ligand binding patterns strictly match the mRNA expression patterns of EphA4 and EphA7. Ligand-receptor binding assays indicate that ephrin-A1 and ephrin-A4 selectively bind EphA4 but not EphA7 in the lysates of striatal tissue. Conversely, ephrin-A2, ephrin-A3, and ephrin-A5 bind EphA7 but not EphA4. These observations implicate selective interactions between ephrin-A molecules and EphA RTKs as potential mechanisms for regulating the compartmental organization of the striatum.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,1999
10648835,"Ephrin-B2 is a candidate ligand for the Eph receptor, EphB6.","No ligand has hitherto been designated for the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family member, EphB6. Here, expression of an EphB6 ligand in the pro-B leukemic cell line, Reh, is demonstrated by binding of soluble EphB6-Fc fusion protein to the Reh cells. The ligand belongs to the subgroup of membrane spanning ligands, as suggested by the fact that phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment did not abrogate binding of EphB6-Fc. Two transmembrane Eph receptor ligands, ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2, were identified in Reh cells. Analysis of EphB6-Fc fusion protein binding to ephrin-B1 or ephrin-B2 transfected COS cells revealed a high-affinity saturable binding between EphB6-Fc and ephrin-B2, but not with ephrin-B1. In mice, EphB6 has previously been shown to be expressed in thymus. Here, we show expression of EphB6 in human thymus, as well as the expression of ephrin-B2 in both human and mouse thymus. We conclude that ephrin-B2 may be a physiological ligand for the EphB6 receptor.",,
18713744,Ephrin-B2-induced cleavage of EphB2 receptor is mediated by matrix metalloproteinases to trigger cell repulsion.,"EphB receptors provide crucial adhesive and repulsive signals during cell migration and axon guidance, but it is unclear how they switch between these opposing responses. Here we provide evidence of an important role for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in repulsive EphB2 signaling. We found that EphB2 is cleaved by MMPs both in vitro and in vivo, and that this cleavage is induced by interaction with its ligand ephrin-B2. Our findings demonstrate that MMP-2/MMP-9-specific inhibition or cleavage-resistant mutations in the ectodomain of EphB2 can prevent EphB2-mediated cell-cell repulsion in HEK293 cells, and block ephrin-B1-induced growth cone withdrawal in cultured hippocampal neurons. Transient expression of wtEphB2, but not noncleavable EphB2-4/5 mutant, restored ephrin-B1-induced growth cone collapse and withdrawal in EphB-deficient neurons. The inhibition of EphB2 cleavage also had potent regulatory effects on EphB2 activity. This study provides the first evidence that MMP-mediated cleavage of EphB2 is induced by receptor-ligand interactions at the cell surface and that this event triggers cell-repulsive responses.",,
12383247,Ephrin-B3-EphA4 interactions regulate the growth of specific thalamocortical axon populations in vitro.,"The role was studied of ephrin-B3, a ligand of the Eph family of tyrosine kinase receptors, in the formation of cortical connectivity. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that EphA4, a receptor of ephrin-B3, was expressed in the lateral thalamus (visual and somaotosensory thalamus) of the developing rat brain, but not in the medial thalamic nuclei which project to the limbic cortex. Correspondingly, ephrin-B3 was expressed strongly in the developing limbic cortex including amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. To examine the action of ephrin-B3 on thalamic axons, either lateral or medial thalamic explants were cultured on membranes obtained from ephrin-B3-expressing COS cells. Axonal growth was inhibited for cells from the lateral thalamus but not from the medial thalamus. These results suggest that ephrin-B3 contributes to regional specificity by suppressing axonal growth of lateral thalamic neurons.",,
9484836,"Ephrin-B3, a ligand for the receptor EphB3, expressed at the midline of the developing neural tube.","The ephrins are a family of ligands that bind to Eph family receptor tyrosine kinases, and have been implicated in axon guidance and other patterning processes during vertebrate development. We describe here the identification and characterization of murine ephrin-B3. The cDNA encodes a 340 amino acid transmembrane molecule, most closely related to the two other known transmembrane ligands, ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2. In addition to homology in their extracellular receptor binding domains, these transmembrane ligands share striking homology between their cytoplasmic domains, with 31 of the last 34 amino acids of ephrin-B3 being identical to ephrin-B2, suggesting functional interactions of the cytoplasmic tail. While most Eph family ligands are promiscuous in their interactions with Eph receptors, binding studies with the five receptors known to bind other transmembrane ligands only revealed a high affinity interaction of ephrin-B3 with EphB3, with a dissociation constant of approximately 1 nM. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos showed ephrin-B3 is expressed prominently at the dorsal and ventral midline of the neural tube, particularly in the floor plate, a structure with key functions in patterning the nervous system. The isolation of this ligand may help to elucidate the molecular basis of patterning activities at the neural tube midline.",,
11470832,Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats of human tenascin-C as ligands for EGF receptor.,"Signaling through growth factor receptors controls such diverse cell functions as proliferation, migration, and differentiation. A critical question has been how the activation of these receptors is regulated. Most, if not all, of the known ligands for these receptors are soluble factors. However, as matrix components are highly tissue-specific and change during development and pathology, it has been suggested that select growth factor receptors might be stimulated by binding to matrix components. Herein, we describe a new class of ligand for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) found within the EGF-like repeats of tenascin-C, an antiadhesive matrix component present during organogenesis, development, and wound repair. Select EGF-like repeats of tenascin-C elicited mitogenesis and EGFR autophosphorylation in an EGFR-dependent manner. Micromolar concentrations of EGF-like repeats induced EGFR autophosphorylation and activated extracellular signal-regulated, mitogen-activated protein kinase to levels comparable to those induced by subsaturating levels of known EGFR ligands. EGFR-dependent adhesion was noted when the ligands were tethered to inert beads, simulating the physiologically relevant presentation of tenascin-C as hexabrachion, and suggesting an increase in avidity similar to that seen for integrin ligands upon surface binding. Specific binding to EGFR was further established by immunofluorescence detection of EGF-like repeats bound to cells and cross-linking of EGFR with the repeats. Both of these interactions were abolished upon competition by EGF and enhanced by dimerization of the EGF-like repeat. Such low affinity behavior would be expected for a matrix-""tethered"" ligand; i.e., a ligand which acts from the matrix, presented continuously to cell surface EGF receptors, because it can neither diffuse away nor be internalized and degraded. These data identify a new class of ""insoluble"" growth factor ligands and a novel mode of activation for growth factor receptors.",,
9312020,Epidermal growth factor and betacellulin mediate signal transduction through co-expressed ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors.,"Interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine 32D cells do not detectably express epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and do not proliferate in response to EGF, heregulin (HRG) or other known EGF-like ligands. Here, we report that EGF specifically binds to and can be crosslinked to 32D transfectants co-expressing ErbB2 and ErbB3 (32D.E2/E3), but not to transfectants expressing either ErbB2 or ErbB3 individually. [125I]EGF-crosslinked species detected in 32D. E2/E3 cells were displaced by HRG and betacellulin (BTC) but not by other EGF-like ligands that were analyzed. EGF, BTC and HRG also induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of downstream signaling molecules and proliferation of 32D.E2/E3 cells. 32D transfectants were also generated which expressed an ErbB3-EGFR chimera alone (32D.E3-E1) or in combination with ErbB2 (32D. E2/E3-E1). While HRG stimulation of 32D.E3-E1 cells resulted in DNA synthesis and receptor phosphorylation, EGF and BTC were inactive. However, EGF and BTC were as effective as HRG in mediating signaling when ErbB2 was co-expressed with the chimera in the 32D.E2/E3-E1 transfectant. These results provide evidence that ErbB2/ErbB3 binding sites for EGF and BTC are formed by a previously undescribed mechanism that requires co-expression of two distinct receptors. Additional data utilizing MDA MB134 human breast carcinoma cells, which naturally express ErbB2 and ErbB3 in the absence of EGFRs, supported the results obtained employing 32D cells and suggest that EGF and BTC may contribute to the progression of carcinomas that co-express ErbB2 and ErbB3.",,
8626392,Epidermal growth factor-related peptides activate distinct subsets of ErbB receptors and differ in their biological activities.,"Numerous epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related peptide binding members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases have been described. While several EGF agonists bind and activate ErbB-1/EGF receptor, neu differentiation factor (NDF) functions as a ligand for ErbB-3 and ErbB-4. However, it is currently unknown which specific subsets of ErbB receptors become activated in response to each of these ligands. The present study addresses this issue using the T47D breast tumor cell line, which expresses moderate levels of all the presently known ErbB receptors. We show that all the EGF agonists, but not NDF, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-1. In contrast, all the EGF-related factors except amphiregulin were able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2. The ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-3 varied dramatically among the different EGF-related peptides. While EGF, transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, and amphiregulin only had a moderate effect, NDF dramatically increased the ErbB-3 phosphotyrosine content. Most notably, heparin binding EGF-related growth factor (HB-EGF) and betacellulin (BTC) were more effective than other EGF agonists. Consequently, only NDF, HB-EGF, and BTC significantly stimulated association of phosphatidylinositol kinase activity with ErbB-3. Among the EGF agonists, HB-EGF induced a low level of ErbB-4 tyrosine phosphorylation, while BTC was as efficient as NDF in activating ErbB-4. The BTC activation of ErbB-4 appears to be independent of ErbB-1, as shown by pretreatment of cells with an antibody that inhibits binding of EGF agonists to ErbB-1. As a result of the differential activation of ErbB receptors, most of the EGF-related growth factors had distinguishable biological activities on cultured mammary epithelial cell lines.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
9419975,"Epiregulin binds to epidermal growth factor receptor and ErbB-4 and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB-2, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4.","Epiregulin is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, and has certain characteristics that are different from that of EGF, including mitogenic responses and binding to EGF receptor (EGFR). Epiregulin may also have another cell surface receptor and/or induces different receptor heterodimerizations for intracellular signaling. We investigated the binding ability of epiregulin to four ErbB family receptors using four human breast carcinoma cell lines that expressed different subsets of receptors. Chemical cross-linking experiments showed that [125I]epiregulin directly bound to each of EGFR and ErbB-4 but not to ErbB-2 and ErbB-3. Furthermore, although epiregulin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of all four ErbB receptors, the main intracellular signal was mediated by ErbB-4 and/or EGFR. The pattern of activation of ErbB family receptors was different from that of other EGF-related ligands. Our findings indicate that ErbB-4 and EGFR are receptors for epiregulin, and suggest that EGF-related ligands transduce signals for different biological responses by the hierarchical mechanism.",Oncogene,1997
28360196,Epithelial chemokine CXCL14 synergizes with CXCL12,"The chemokine receptor, CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), is selective for CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), is broadly expressed in blood and tissue cells, and is essential during embryogenesis and hematopoiesis. CXCL14 is a homeostatic chemokine with unknown receptor selectivity and preferential expression in peripheral tissues. Here, we demonstrate that CXCL14 synergized with CXCL12 in the induction of chemokine responses in primary human lymphoid cells and cell lines that express CXCR4. Combining subactive concentrations of CXCL12 with 100-300 nM CXCL14 resulted in chemotaxis responses that exceeded maximal responses that were obtained with CXCL12 alone.

In the present report, we describe that affinity-purified gp330 from rabbit renal cortex binds plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) complexed with urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). alpha 2M-methylamine, which binds with high affinity to alpha 2MR/LRP, did not bind to gp330. The apparent Kd for binding of uPA.PAI-1 complexes was about 0.8 nM at 4 degrees C. The binding was calcium-dependent and inhibited by recombinant RAP (rRAP) and tissue type plasminogen activator-PAI-1 complexes. Thin sections of rabbit renal proximal tubules bound 125I-labeled uPA.PAI-1 and rRAP in the apical part of proximal tubules corresponding to the localization of gp330. The binding of 125I-uPA.PAI-1 complexes in tubules was abolished by excess unlabeled rRAP, and a rRAP-inhibitable endocytosis and degradation of labeled uPA.PAI-1 complexes was demonstrated by perfusion of isolated rabbit proximal tubules. The results establish an endocytotic function of gp330 and suggest that gp330 is an important component of the fibrinolytic system in gp330-containing epithelial as found in, for example, kidney and lung.",,
28280243,Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) can mediate IL-6,Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) is a subunit of the composite cytokines IL-27 and IL-35. Both have beneficial functions or effects in models of infectious and autoimmune diseases. This suggests that administration of EBI3 could be therapeutically useful by binding free p28 and p35 to generate IL-27 and IL-35. IL-27- and IL-35-independent functions of EBI3 could compromise its therapeutic uses. We therefore assessed the effects of EBI3 on cytokine receptor-expressing cells. We observed that EBI3 activates STAT3 and induces the proliferation of the IL-6-dependent B9 mouse plasmacytoma cell line. Analyses using blocking mAbs and Ba/F3 transfectants expressing gp130 indicate that EBI3 activity was linked to its capacity to mediate IL-6,,
22279592,"ErbB2, EphrinB1, Src kinase and PTPN13 signaling complex regulates MAP kinase signaling in human cancers.","In non-cancerous cells, phosphorylated proteins exist transiently, becoming de-phosphorylated by specific phosphatases that terminate propagation of signaling pathways. In cancers, compromised phosphatase activity and/or expression occur and contribute to tumor phenotype. The non-receptor phosphatase, PTPN13, has recently been dubbed a putative tumor suppressor. It decreased expression in breast cancer correlates with decreased overall survival. Here we show that PTPN13 regulates a new signaling complex in breast cancer consisting of ErbB2, Src, and EphrinB1. To our knowledge, this signaling complex has not been previously described. Co-immunoprecipitation and localization studies demonstrate that EphrinB1, a PTPN13 substrate, interacts with ErbB2. In addition, the oncogenic V660E ErbB2 mutation enhances this interaction, while Src kinase mediates EphrinB1 phosphorylation and subsequent MAP Kinase signaling. Decreased PTPN13 function further enhances signaling. The association of oncogene kinases (ErbB2, Src), a signaling transmembrane ligand (EphrinB1) and a phosphatase tumor suppressor (PTPN13) suggest that EphrinB1 may be a relevant therapeutic target in breast cancers harboring ErbB2-activating mutations and decreased PTPN13 expression.",PloS one,2012
25586589,Erythropoietin promotes bone formation through EphrinB2/EphB4 signaling.,"Recent studies have demonstrated that erythropoietin (EPO) has extensive nonhematopoietic biological functions. However, little is known about how EPO regulates bone formation, although several studies suggested that EPO can affect bone homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the effects of EPO on the communication between osteoclasts and osteoblasts through the ephrinB2/EphB4 signaling pathway. We found that EPO slightly promotes osteoblastic differentiation with the increased expression of EphB4 in ST2 cells. However, EPO increased the expression of Nfatc1 and ephrinB2 but decreased the expression of Mmp9 in RAW264.7 cells, resulting in an increase of ephrinB2-expressing osteoclasts and a decrease in resorption activity. The stimulation of ephrinB2/EphB4 signaling via ephrinB2-Fc significantly promoted EPO-mediated osteoblastic differentiation in ST2 cells. EphB4 knockdown through EphB4 shRNA inhibited EPO-mediated osteoblastic phenotypes. Furthermore, in vivo assays clearly demonstrated that EPO efficiently induces new bone formation in the alveolar bone regeneration model. Taken together, these results suggest that ephrinB2/EphB4 signaling may play an important role in EPO-mediated bone formation.",,
26481148,Erythropoietin Stimulates Tumor Growth via EphB4.,"While recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) has been widely used to treat anemia in cancer patients, concerns about its adverse effects on patient survival have emerged. A lack of correlation between expression of the canonical EpoR and rhEpo's effects on cancer cells prompted us to consider the existence of an alternative Epo receptor. Here, we identified EphB4 as an Epo receptor that triggers downstream signaling via STAT3 and promotes rhEpo-induced tumor growth and progression. In human ovarian and breast cancer samples, expression of EphB4 rather than the canonical EpoR correlated with decreased disease-specific survival in rhEpo-treated patients. These results identify EphB4 as a critical mediator of erythropoietin-induced tumor progression and further provide clinically significant dimension to the biology of erythropoietin.",,
7647976,ETA receptor-mediated constrictor responses to endothelin peptides in human blood vessels in vitro.,"1. We have characterized the constrictor endothelin receptors present in human isolated blood vessels using ETA and ETB selective agonists and antagonists. 2. Monophasic dose-response curves were obtained for ET-1 with EC50 values of 6.8 nM in coronary artery, 3.9 nM in internal mammary artery, 17.4 nM in pulmonary artery, 14.5 nM in aorta and 3.2 nM in saphenous vein. In coronary artery, ET-2 was equipotent with ET-1 with an EC50 value of 5.7 nM. The non-selective peptide, sarafotoxin 6b, was 2-3 times less potent than ET-1 but the maximum responses to these two were comparable. 3. In each vessel ET-3 was much less active than ET-1. No response was obtained to ET-3 in aorta and pulmonary artery or in up to 50% of coronary artery, mammary artery and saphenous vein preparations. In those preparations that did respond, dose-response curves were incomplete at 300 nM. Variable contractions were also obtained with the ETB-selective agonist, sarafotoxin 6c (S6c). Where responses were detected, although S6c was more potent than ET-1 (EC50 values of 0.6-1.2 nM), the maximum response produced was always less than 20% of that to ET-1. 4. The synthetic ETB agonists, BQ3020 and [1,3,11,15Ala]-ET-1, were without effect in any of the five blood vessels at concentrations up to 3 microM. 5. ET-1-induced vasoconstriction was blocked by the ETA-selective antagonists, BQ123 and FR139317. Schild-derived pA2 values were 7.0, 7.4 and 6.9 for BQ123 and 7.6, 7.9 and 7.3 for FR139317 in coronary artery, mammary artery and saphenous vein, respectively, consistent with antagonism of ETA receptors. Slopes of the Schild regressions were not significantly different from one. Comparable values of pA2 were estimated for 3ftM BQ123 in aorta (7.4+/-0.5) and pulmonary artery (6.9) from the Gaddum-Schild equation.6. In conclusion we have shown that in human isolated blood vessels, ET-1 is more potent than ET-3 suggesting the presence of vasoconstrictor ETA receptors. This is supported by the lack of effect of the ETB agonists, BQ3020 and [1,3,1,1,15Ala]-ET-l and the ability of the ETA antagonists, BQ123 andFR139317 to block ET-1 responses. Some preparations did contract in response to low concentrations of the ETB-selective sarafotoxin 6c but responses were variable and the maximum was always much less than that to ET-1 in the same preparations. Therefore although constrictor ETB receptors were present on the smooth muscle of human blood vessels, vasoconstriction elicited by the endothelin peptides in vitro is via ETA receptor activation.",,
10657301,Eta-1 (osteopontin): an early component of type-1 (cell-mediated) immunity.,"Cell-mediated (type-1) immunity is necessary for immune protection against most intracellular pathogens and, when excessive, can mediate organ-specific autoimmune destruction. Mice deficient in Eta-1 (also called osteopontin) gene expression have severely impaired type-1 immunity to viral infection [herpes simplex virus-type 1 (KOS strain)] and bacterial infection (Listeria monocytogenes) and do not develop sarcoid-type granulomas. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma production is diminished, and IL-10 production is increased. A phosphorylation-dependent interaction between the amino-terminal portion of Eta-1 and its integrin receptor stimulated IL-12 expression, whereas a phosphorylation-independent interaction with CD44 inhibited IL-10 expression. These findings identify Eta-1 as a key cytokine that sets the stage for efficient type-1 immune responses through differential regulation of macrophage IL-12 and IL-10 cytokine expression.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2000
10438490,"Evidence for a direct interaction between the penultimate aspartic acid of cholecystokinin and histidine 207, located in the second extracellular loop of the cholecystokinin B receptor.","Recently, we reported that the mutation of His(207) to Phe located in the second extracellular loop of the cholecystokinin B receptor strongly affected cholecystokinin (CCK) binding (Silvente-Poirot, S., Escrieut, C., and Wank, S. A. (1998) Mol. Pharmacol. 54, 364-371). To characterize the functional group in CCK that interacts with His(207), we first substituted His(207) to Ala. This mutation decreased the affinity and the potency of CCK to produce total inositol phosphates 302-fold and 456-fold without affecting the expression of the mutant receptor. The screening of L-alanine-modified CCK peptides to bind and activate the wild type and mutant receptors allowed the identification of the interaction of the C-terminal Asp(8) of CCK with His(207). The H207A-CCKBR mutant, unlike the wild type receptor, was insensitive to substitution of Asp(8) of CCK to other amino acid residues. This interaction was further confirmed by mutating His(207) to Asp. The affinity of CCK for the H207D-CCKBR mutant was 100-fold lower than for the H207A-CCKBR mutant, consistent with an electrostatic repulsion between the negative charges of the two interacting aspartic acids. Peptides with neutral amino acids in position eight of CCK reversed this effect and displayed a gain of affinity for the H207D mutant compared with CCK. To date, this is the first report concerning the identification of a direct contact point between the CCKB receptor and CCK.",,
10077672,Evidence for a physical interaction between presenilin and Notch.,"Genetic analyses in Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrate that sel-12 and hop-1, homologues of the Alzheimer's disease-associated presenilin genes, modify signaling through LIN-12 and GLP-1, homologues of the Notch cell surface receptor. To gain insight into the biochemical basis of this genetic interaction, we tested the possibility that presenilin-1 (PS1) physically associates with the Notch1 receptor in mammalian cells. Notch1 and PS1 coimmunoprecipitated from transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cell lysates in a detergent-sensitive manner, consistent with a noncovalent physical association between the two proteins. The interaction predominantly occurred early in the secretory pathway prior to Notch cleavage in the Golgi, because PS1 immunoprecipitation preferentially recovered the full-length Notch1 precursor. When PS1 was immunoprecipitated from 293 cells that had been metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, Notch1 was the primary protein detected in PS1 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that this interaction is specific. Furthermore, endogenous Notch and presenilin coimmunoprecipitated from cultured Drosophila cells, indicating that physical interaction can occur at physiological expression levels. These results suggest that the genetic relationship between presenilins and the Notch signaling pathway derives from a direct physical association between these proteins in the secretory pathway.",,
10545285,Evidence for autocrine actions of neuromedin B and gastrin-releasing peptide in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), a member of the bombesin family of peptides, has been shown to have mitogenic activity in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and to be produced by SCLC in an autocrine fashion. In this report, we demonstrate that both GRP and another member of the bombesin family of peptides, neuromedin B (NMB), are also autocrine growth factors for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14 of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were produced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were produced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times that of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were equivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR and NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was adapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed A549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium. Using either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and GRP were found to be mitogens for three NSCLC cell lines that express mRNA for BLP receptors and secrete BLPs, regardless of which peptide and/or receptor subtype was detected. The monoclonal antibody 2A11, which preferentially recognizes GRP, was able to block the in vitro proliferative response to GRP in the BrDU incorporation assay, and partially blocked the response to NMB. The 2A11 antibody could only partially block the in vivo growth of cell lines that showed proliferative responses to BLPs. 2A11 antibody was more effective against the 239T cell line, which secreted a low amount of GRP into the medium (0.6 nM), compared to the 201T cell line, which secreted a higher amount of both GRP and NMB (4.2 nM and 36.6 nM, respectively). These results suggest that both NMB and GRP are autocrine growth factors for NSCLC, but that the production of NMB and expression of the NMBR may be more prominent than the production of GRP and expression of the GRP receptor. If BLP ligand-receptor systems are to be targeted therapeutically in NSCLC, it will be necessary to inhibit both NMB and GRP.",Pulmonary pharmacology & therapeutics,1999
28325905,Evidence for C1q-mediated crosslinking of CD33/LAIR-1 inhibitory immunoreceptors and biological control of CD33/LAIR-1 expression.,"C1q collagen-like region (CLR) engaging and activating the LAIR-1 inhibitory immunoreceptor represents a non-complement mechanism for maintaining immune quiescence. Given the binding promiscuity of C1q's globular region (gC1q), we hypothesized that C1q concurrently associates with distinct inhibitory immunoreceptors to produce C1q-mediated modulatory networking. Like LAIR-1, CD33 inhibitory immunoreceptors are highly expressed on monocytes. Binding CD33 restricts cell activation/differentiation; however, natural ligands for CD33 remain elusive. CD33 has IgC2-like domains potentially recognized by gC1q. Thus, we asked whether C1q binds to CD33 and if C1q mediates CD33/LAIR-1 crosslinking. Our findings demonstrate that C1q and gC1q interact with CD33 to activate its inhibitory motifs, while CLR does not. Whole C1q is required to crosslink CD33 and LAIR-1 and concurrently activate CD33/LAIR-1 inhibitory motifs. While C1q binds CD33C2 domains, decreased C1q-CD33 interactions resulting from sialic acid masking of CD33C2 domains suggests a process for regulating C1q-CD33 activity. Consistent with defective self-tolerance, CD33/LAIR-1 expression is reduced in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) myelomonocytes. The anti-inflammatory cytokine M-CSF, but not DC growth factors, sustains CD33/LAIR-1 expression on both healthy and SLE cells suggesting further biological control of C1q-CD33/LAIR-1 processes.",Scientific reports,2017

The synthetic opioid, D-Ala2,D-Leu5-enkephalin (DADLE), stimulated photolabeling of the 39-41-kDa proteins. In the presence of GDP, which increased the ratio of agonist-stimulated to basal photolabeling, DADLE at a maximally effective concentration stimulated photolabeling of the 39- and the 40-kDa protein 2-3-fold. Somatostatin, adrenaline, and bradykinin were less potent than DADLE and, to varying degrees, stimulated photolabeling of the 40-kDa protein more than that of the 39-kDa protein.

16226035,Evidence for the existence of two Robo3 isoforms with divergent biochemical properties.,"Robo3 is a member of the roundabout (Robo) family of proteins that plays a key role in axon guidance and cell migration in the developing nervous system. Recent studies have shown that Robo3 plays a crucial role in controlling axon guidance at the midline of the CNS. Here we describe and compare two human Robo3 isoforms, Robo3A and Robo3B, which differ by the insertion of 26 amino acids at the N-terminus, and these forms appear to be evolutionary conserved. We investigated the bioactivity of these isoforms and show that they have different binding properties to Slit, and that orthologs of these forms are expressed in the mouse embryo. In addition, we show that, like other members of the Robo family, Robo3 can bind homophilically, but it is also capable of binding heterophilically to Robo1 and NCAM. We propose that these properties of Robo3 may contribute to its function at the midline of the CNS.",,

We identified an alternatively spliced transcript that encodes a form of mouse OB-R with a long intracellular domain. db/db mice also produce this alternatively spliced transcript, but with a 106 nt insertion that prematurely terminates the intracellular domain. We further identified G --> T point mutation in the genomic OB-R sequence in db/db mice. This mutation generates a donor splice site that converts the 106 nt region to a novel exon retained in the OB-R transcript. We predict that the long intracellular domain form of OB-R is crucial for initiating intracellular signal transduction, and as a corollary, the inability to produce this form of OB-R leads to the severe obese phenotype found in db/db mice.",Cell,1996

N-terminal sequence analysis of the 500 kDa and 85 kDa polypeptides, analysis of a random selection of peptides convering 536 residues from these polypeptides, and analysis of a 1772 bp cDNA encoding part of the 500 kDa polypeptide provide evidence that the 500 kDa and 85 kDa chains are the alpha- and beta-subunits, respectively, of a recently cloned hepatic membrane protein, termed the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP) (Herz, J., Hamann, U., Rogne, S., Myklebost, O., Gausepohl, H. and Stanley, K.K.

10866201,Excessive placental secretion of neurokinin B during the third trimester causes pre-eclampsia.,"Pre-eclampsia is a principal cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, affecting 5-10% of first pregnancies worldwide. Manifestations include increased blood pressure, proteinuria, coagulopathy and peripheral and cerebral oedema. Although the aetiology and pathogenesis remain to be elucidated, the placenta is undoubtedly involved, as termination of pregnancy eradicates the disease. Here we have cloned a complementary DNA from human placental messenger RNA encoding a precursor protein of 121 amino acids which gives rise to a mature peptide identical to the neuropeptide neurokinin B (NKB) of other mammalian species. In female rats, concentrations of NKB several-fold above that of an animal 20 days into pregnancy caused substantial pressor activity. In human pregnancy, the expression of NKB was confined to the outer syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta, significant concentrations of NKB could be detected in plasma as early as week 9, and plasma concentrations of NKB were grossly elevated in pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. We conclude that elevated levels of NKB in early pregnancy may be an indicator of hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and that treatment with certain neurokinin receptor antagonists may be useful in alleviating the symptoms.",Nature,2000
11248553,Excitatory Eph receptors and adhesive ephrin ligands.,"Ephrins are cell surface associated ligands for Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and are implicated in repulsive axon guidance, cell migration, topographic mapping and angiogenesis. During the past year, Eph receptors have been shown to associate with glutamate receptors in excitatory neurons, suggesting a role in synapse formation or function. Moreover, ephrin/Eph signaling appears to regulate neural stem cell proliferation and migration in adult mouse brains. The mode of action of ephrin/Ephs has been expanded from repulsion to adhesion and from cell surface attachment to regulated cleavage.",Current opinion in cell biology,2001
7687739,Exon switching and activation of stromal and embryonic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-FGF receptor genes in prostate epithelial cells accompany stromal independence and malignancy.,"Stroma and the heparin-binding fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family influence normal epithelial cell growth and differentiation in embryonic and adult tissues. The role of stromal cells and the expression of isoforms of the FGF ligand and receptor family were examined during malignant progression of epithelial cells from a differentiated, slowly growing, nonmalignant model rat prostate tumor. In syngeneic hosts, a mixture of stromal and epithelial cells resulted in nonmalignant tumors which were differentiated and slowly growing. In the absence of the stromal cells, epithelial cells progressed to malignant tumors which were independent of the stroma and undifferentiated. The independence of the malignant epithelial cells from stromal cells was accompanied by a switch from exclusive expression of exon IIIb to exclusive expression of exon IIIc in the FGF receptor 2 (FGF-R2) gene. The FGF-R2(IIIb) isoform displays high affinity for stromal cell-derived FGF-7, whereas the FGF-R2(IIIc) isoform does not recognize FGF-7 but has high affinity for the FGF-2 member of the FGF ligand family. The switch from expression of exclusively exon IIIb to exclusively exon IIIc in the resident FGF-R2 gene was followed by activation of the FGF-2 ligand gene, the normally stromal cell FGF-R1 gene, and embryonic FGF-3 and FGF-5 ligand genes in malignant epithelial cells. Multiple autocrine and potentially intracrine ligand-receptor loops resulting from these alterations within the FGF-FGF-R family may underlie the autonomy of malignant tumor cells.",Molecular and cellular biology,1993

8576175,Expression and biological activity of mouse fibroblast growth factor-9.,"Receptor specificity is an essential mechanism governing the activity of fibroblast growth factors (FGF). To begin to understand the developmental role of FGF-9/glial activating factor, we have cloned and sequenced the murine FGF-9 cDNA and expressed the protein in mammalian cells and in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that the FGF-9 protein is highly conserved between mouse and human. Receptor specificity was determined by direct binding to soluble and cell surface forms of FGF receptor (FGFR) splice variants and by the mitogenic activity on cells, which express unique FGF receptor splice variants. Our data demonstrate that FGF-9 efficiently activates the ""c"" splice forms of FGFR2 and FGFR3, receptors expressed in potential target cells for FGF-9. Significantly, FGF-9 also binds to and activates the ""b"" splice form of FGFR3, thus becoming the first FGF ligand besides FGF-1 to activate this highly specific member of the FGF receptor family.",,
10770212,Expression and biological effects of endothelin-1 in human gonadotropin-releasing hormone-secreting neurons.,"In a previous report, we demonstrated that in FNC-B4 cells, derived and characterized from a human fetal olfactory epithelium, both sex steroids and odorants regulate GnRH secretion. We now report the presence and biological activity of endothelin (ET)-1 in this GnRH-secreting neuronal cell. By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we found gene and protein expression of ET-1 and its converting enzyme ECE-1 in both fetal olfactory mucosa and FNC-B4 cells. The presence of authentic ET-1 in the conditioned media of FNC-B4 cells was further supported by combined RIAs and high-performance liquid chromatography studies. Experiments with radiolabeled ET-1 and ET-3 strongly indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites, corresponding to the ETA (16,500 sites/cell) and the ETB receptors (8,700 sites/cell). Functional studies, using selective analogs, indicated that these two classes of receptors subserve distinct functions in human GnRH-secreting cells. The ETA receptor subtype mediated an increase in intracellular calcium and GnRH secretion. Conversely, stimulation of the ETB subtype induced DNA synthesis and mitogen-activated protein kinase p44ERK1 expression. This is the first demonstration, in a human in vitro model, of a neuroendocrine role for ET-1 as regulator of GnRH-secreting neuron activity.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2000
7838118,Expression and characterization of cloned human bombesin receptors.,"Little is known about the pharmacology or cell biology of human bombesin (Bn) receptors, because they are usually present at low levels and both subtypes are frequently present in the same tissues. Human gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptors (huGRP-R) and human neuromedin B (NMB) receptors (huNMB-R) were stably transfected into BALB/3T3 fibroblasts. Both receptor types were glycosylated, with 35% of the huGRP-R and 38% of the huNMB-R representing carbohydrate residues. The extent of glycosylation of the transfected huGRP-R was the same as that seen in the human glioblastoma cell line U-118. Radiolabeled agonist ligands were rapidly internalized, whereas noninternalized ligand readily dissociated in a temperature-dependent fashion. The affinities of various agonists for binding to the huGRP-R were Bn (Ki = 1.4 +/- 0.2 nM) = 4 x GRP = 300 x NMB. In contrast, affinities for the huNMB-R were NMB (Ki = 8.1 +/- 5.2 nM) = 4 x Bn = 600 x GRP. [F5-D-Phe6,D-Ala11]Bn(6-13)methyl ester was the most potent huGRP-R antagonist, whereas D-Nal-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Nal-NH2 was the most potent huNMB-R antagonist. Agonist binding to either receptor type caused activation of phospholipase C and increased cellular [3H]inositol phosphate levels. GRP was potent at increasing [3H]inositol phosphate generation in cells expressing the huGRP-R (EC50 = 13.6 +/- 1.3 nM), whereas NMB was similarly potent when acting upon cells expressing the huNMB-R (EC50 = 9.3 +/- 1.4 nM). However, neither receptor type, when stimulated with agonist, caused an increase in cAMP levels. These data show that stably transfected huGRP-R exhibit similar pharmacology for agonists and antagonists, are appropriately glycosylated, and function similarly with respect to their ability to alter biological activity, compared with natively expressed receptors. Minimal native huNMB-R data are available for comparison, but in general the huNMB-R is similar to the rat NMB receptor in its pharmacology and cell biology.",Molecular pharmacology,1995
7664431,Expression and functional significance of tumor necrosis factor receptors in human myocardium.,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a proinflammatory cytokine with potent negative inotropic properties, is elaborated in septic shock, acute myocarditis, reperfusion injury, and congestive heart failure. TNF-alpha acts by binding to two specific receptors: TNFR1 and TNFR2. However, neither the presence nor the significance of TNF receptors has been studied in the adult mammalian heart.",,
11154210,Expression and regulation of chemokine receptors in human natural killer cells.,"Using flow cytometric and RNase protection assays, this study examined the expression of chemokine receptors in nonactivated natural killer (NK) cells and compared this expression with NK cells activated with interleukin (IL)-2, which either adhered to plastic flasks (AD) or did not adhere (NA). None of the NK cell subsets expressed CXCR2, CXCR5, or CCR5. The major differences between these cells include increased expression of CXCR1, CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, CCR8, and CX(3)CR1 in AD when compared to NA or nonactivated NK cells. The chemotactic response to the CXC and CC chemokines correlated with the receptor expression except that all 3 populations responded to GRO-alpha, despite their lack of CXCR2 expression. Pretreatment of these cells with anti-CXCR2 did not inhibit the chemotactic response to GRO-alpha. In addition, nonactivated and NA cells responded to fractalkine, although they lack the expression of CX(3)CR1. This activity was not inhibited by anti-CX(3)CR1. Viral macrophage inflammatory protein (vMIP)-I, I-309, and TARC competed with the binding of (125)I-309 to AD cells with varying affinities. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 but not any other cytokine or chemokine examined including interferon (IFN)-gamma, MIP-3beta, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) or I-309, up-regulated the expression of CXCR3 and CXCR4 on NK cell surface. This is correlated with increased chemotaxis of NK cells treated with TGF-beta1 toward stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10). Messenger RNA for lymphotactin, RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta, but not IP-10, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, IL-8, or I-309 was expressed in all 3 NK cell subsets. Our results may have implications for the dissemination of NK cells at the sites of tumor growth or viral replication. (Blood. 2001;97:367-375)",Blood,2001
7592910,Expression cloning and pharmacological characterization of a human hippocampal neuropeptide Y/peptide YY Y2 receptor subtype.,"The pancreatic polypeptide family includes neuropeptide Y (NPY), one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the mammalian nervous system, as well as peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). This peptide family is involved in numerous physiological processes such as memory, pain, blood pressure, appetite, anxiety, and circadian rhythm. Of the multiple Y-type receptors proposed for PP family members, only the Y1 subtype was cloned previously. We now report the isolation of a human Y2 (hhY2) receptor cDNA by expression cloning from a human hippocampal cDNA library, using a 125I-PYY binding assay. hhY2 cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 381 amino acids with low amino acid identity to the human Y1 receptor (31% overall; 41% transmembrane). 125I-PYY binding to transiently expressed hY2 receptors was saturable (pKd = 10.17) and displaceable by human PP family members in rank order: PYY (pKi = 9.47) approximately NPY (pKi = 9.27) >> PP (pKi < 6) and by peptide analogs: NPY2-36 (pKi = 8.80) approximately NPY13-36 (pKi = 8.55) approximately C2-NPY (pKi = 8.54) > NPY26-36 (pKi = 6.51) approximately [Leu31,Pro34]NPY (pKi = 6.23).

2175902,Expression cloning of a cDNA encoding the mouse pituitary thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor.,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is an important extracellular regulatory molecule that functions as a releasing factor in the anterior pituitary gland and as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Binding sites for TRH are present in these tissues, but the TRH receptor (TRH-R) has not been purified from any source. Using Xenopus laevis oocytes in an expression cloning strategy, we have isolated a cDNA clone that encodes the mouse pituitary TRH-R. This conclusion is based on the following evidence. Injection of sense RNA transcribed in vitro from this cDNA into Xenopus oocytes leads to expression of cell-surface receptors that bind TRH and the competitive antagonist chlordiazepoxide with appropriate affinities and that elicit electrophysiological responses to TRH with the appropriate concentration dependency. Antisense RNA inhibits the TRH response in Xenopus oocytes injected with RNA isolated from normal rat anterior pituitary glands. Finally, transfection of COS-1 cells with this cDNA leads to expression of receptors that bind TRH and chlordiazepoxide with appropriate affinities and that transduce TRH stimulation of inositol phosphate formation. The 3.8-kilobase mouse TRH-R cDNA encodes a protein of 393 amino acids that shows similarities to other guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein-coupled receptors.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1990
8063797,Expression cloning of a human B1 bradykinin receptor.,"A cDNA clone encoding a human B1 bradykinin receptor was isolated from a human embryonic lung fibroblast cDNA library by expression cloning. The photoprotein aequorin was utilized as an indicator of the ability of the B1 receptor agonist [des-Arg10]kallidin to mediate Ca2+ mobilization in Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with RNA. A clone was isolated with a 1307-nucleotide insert which contains an open reading frame encoding a 353-amino acid protein with the characteristics of a G-protein-coupled receptor. The amino acid sequence of the B1 bradykinin receptor is 36% identical to the amino acid sequence of the B2 bradykinin receptor. The cloned B1 bradykinin receptor expressed in mammalian cells exhibits high affinity binding for 3H-labeled [des-Arg10]kallidin and low affinity for bradykinin. The B1 receptor antagonist [des-Arg10,Leu9]kallidin effectively displaces 3H-labeled [des-Arg10]kallidin from the cloned receptor, whereas the B2 receptor antagonist Hoe-140 (D-Arg0-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]bradykinin, where Thi is L-[3-(2-thienyl)alanyl], Tic is D-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-3-yl-carbonyl), and Oic is L-[(3aS, 7aS)-octahydroindol-2-yl-carbonyl]) does not. Therefore, the expressed receptor has the pharmacological characteristics of the B1 receptor subtype. The availability of both the cloned human B1 and B2 bradykinin receptors should allow the elucidation of the relative contributions of these two receptor subtypes in acute and chronic inflammatory processes.",,
8632753,Expression cloning of a human brain neuropeptide Y Y2 receptor.,"The 36-amino acid peptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY), is a member of a peptide family that includes the endocrine peptides, peptide YY (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY receptors have been broadly subdivided into postsynaptic Y1 receptors and presynaptic Y2 receptors based on the preference of Pro34-substituted analogues for the Y1 receptors and carboxyl-terminal fragments for the Y2. A Y1 receptor has been cloned, and this receptor appears to mediate several effects of NPY, including vasoconstriction and anxiolysis in animal models. We report the cloning of a human brain Y2 receptor from a human brain library. Pools of clones were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, and 125I-PYY binding pools were identified by autoradiography. After a single positive pool was detected in the original screening, a single clone was isolated by four rounds of sequential enrichment. The clone encoded a 381-amino acid protein of the heptahelix (seven TM) type. Amino acid identity of this receptor with the Y1 receptor was 31% overall with 40% identity in the TM regions. Comparison with the human PP1 receptor indicated 33% overall amino acid identity with 42% identity in the TM regions. Pharmacologically, the receptor exhibited high affinity for NPY, PYY, and carboxyl-terminal fragments of NPY and PYY. In addition, Pro34-substituted analogues had very low affinity. With the use of Northern blot analysis, high levels of Y2 mRNA were detected in a variety of brain regions with little expression in peripheral tissues. Thus, the receptor protein has the pharmacological properties and distribution of the human Y2 receptor.",,
7692441,Expression cloning of a human corticotropin-releasing-factor receptor.,"Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is the principal neuroregulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and plays an important role in coordinating the endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stress and immune challenge. We report here the cloning of a cDNA coding for a CRF receptor from a human corticotropic tumor library. The cloned cDNA encodes a 415-amino acid protein comprising seven putative membrane-spanning domains and is structurally related to the calcitonin/vasoactive intestinal peptide/growth hormone-releasing hormone subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. The receptor expressed in COS cells binds rat/human CRF with high affinity (Kd = 3.3 +/- 0.45 nM) and specificity and is functionally coupled to adenylate cyclase. The CRF antagonist alpha-helCRF-(9-41) inhibits the CRF-stimulated increase in intracellular cAMP. Northern blot analysis reveals that the CRF receptor is expressed in the rat pituitary and brain as well as in the mouse AtT20 corticotropic cells. We also describe an alternatively spliced form of the receptor which includes an insert of 29 amino acids in the first intracellular loop.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1993
11290797,"Expression cloning of the STRL33/BONZO/TYMSTRligand reveals elements of CC, CXC, and CX3C chemokines.","STRL33/BONZO/TYMSTR is an orphan chemokine and HIV/SIV coreceptor receptor that is expressed on activated T lymphocytes. We describe an expression cloning strategy whereby we isolated a novel chemokine, which we name CXCL16. CXCL16 is an alpha (CXC) chemokine but also has characteristics of CC chemokines and a structure similar to fractalkine (neurotactin) in having a transmembrane region and a chemokine domain suspended by a mucin-like stalk. A recombinant version of CXCL16 fails to mediate chemotaxis to all known chemokine receptor transfectants tested but does mediate robust chemotaxis, high affinity binding, and calcium mobilization to Bonzo receptor transfectants, indicating that this is a unique receptor ligand interaction. In vitro polarized T cell subsets including Th1, Th2, and Tr1 cells express functional Bonzo, suggesting expression of this receptor in chronic inflammation, which we further verified by demonstration of CXCL16-mediated migration of tonsil-derived CD4(+) T lymphocytes. CXCL16 is expressed on the surface of APCs including subsets of CD19(+) B cells and CD14(+) monocyte/macrophages, and functional CXCL16 is also shed from macrophages. The combination of unique structural features of both Bonzo and CXCL16 suggest that this interaction may represent a new class of ligands for this receptor family. Additionally, this chemokine might play a unique dual role of attracting activated lymphocyte subsets during inflammation as well as facilitating immune responses via cell-cell contact.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2001
12218106,Expression of a functional eotaxin (CC chemokine ligand 11) receptor CCR3 by human dendritic cells.,"Critical to the function of Ag-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) is their capacity to migrate to lymphoid organs and to sites of inflammation. A final stage of development, termed maturation, yields DCs that are strong stimulators of T cell-mediated immunity and is associated with a remodeling of the cell surface that includes a change in the levels of expression of many molecules, including chemokine receptors. We show in this study that CCR3, a chemokine receptor initially discovered on eosinophils, is also expressed by human DCs that differentiate from blood monocytes, DCs that emigrate from skin (epidermal and dermal DCs), and DCs derived from CD34+ hemopoietic precursors in bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, and cytokine-elicited peripheral blood leukapheresis. Unlike other chemokine receptors, such as CCR5 and CCR7, the expression of CCR3 is not dependent on the state of maturation. All DC subsets contain a large intracellular pool of CCR3. The surface expression of CCR3 is not modulated following uptake of particulate substances such as zymosan or latex beads. CCR3 mediates in vitro chemotactic responses to the known ligands, eotaxin and eotaxin-2, because the DC response to these chemokines is inhibited by CCR3-specific mAbs. We postulate that expression of CCR3 may underlie situations where both DCs and eosinophils accumulate in vivo, such as the lesions of patients with Langerhans cell granulomatosis.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2002

11159507,Expression of CCR9 beta-chemokine receptor is modulated in thymocyte differentiation and is selectively maintained in CD8(+) T cells from secondary lymphoid organs.,"Chemokines appear to have an important role in the seeding of lymphoid progenitors in the thymus, the regulation of the coordinated movements of the maturing T cells within this organ, and the egress of the resulting naive T cells to secondary lymphoid organs. CCR9, the specific receptor for the beta-chemokine TECK/CCL25, is selectively expressed in thymus, lymph node, and spleen. Using a specific anti-CCR9 polyclonal antibody, K629, and a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction procedure, a detailed study of CCR9 expression in the thymus and secondary lymphoid organs was performed. The results show that CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes have the highest CCR9 expression in thymus. Single-positive CD8(+) thymocytes continue to express this receptor after abandoning the thymus as mature naive T cells, as suggested by the existence of a CD8(+)CD69(low)CD62L(high) CCR9(+) cell subset. Consistent with this, CD8(+) lymphocytes from lymph nodes, spleen, and Peyer patches express a functional CCR9, as its expression correlates with migration in response to CCL25. Conversely, CD4(+) thymocytes lose CCR9 before abandoning the thymus, and CD4(+) T cells from secondary lymphoid organs also lack CCR9 expression. Analysis of CCR9 expression in thymocytes from mice of different ages showed that CCR9 levels are affected by age, as this receptor is more abundant, and its response to CCL25 is more potent in newborn animals. Collectively, these results suggest that CCR9 has a role in thymocyte development throughout murine life, with clear differences between the CD4(+) and CD8(+) lineages.",Blood,2001
10470109,Expression of CD 73 (ecto-5'-nucleotidase) in 165 glioblastomas by immunohistochemistry and electronmicroscopic histochemistry.,"CD 73 (5'-nucleotidase) is an ectoenzyme, which is expressed on normal and neoplastic glial plasma membranes. The enzyme binds to intracellular filamentous actin and the extracellular matrix proteins laminin and fibronectin. CD 73 is a signalling pathway metabolite in the immune response of lymphocytes. The ectoenzyme catalyzes the conversion of purine and pyrimidine ribo- and deoxyribo-nucleoside monophosphates (AMP, GMP, IMP) and leads to elevation of the corresponding nucleosides (adenosine) in the extracellular space and might therefore modulate neuronal signalling and vascular perfusion. CD 73 has also been called a cellular motility factor. There is an increasing amount of evidence for the modulatory role of PKC-mediated CD 73 activity in ischemia, regeneration and repair, glioma cell proliferation and a possible invasion promoting feature of the ectoenzyme. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression patterns of CD 73 together with the labelling of PKC and EGFR. The latter is known as a marker for primary glioblastomas.",Anticancer research,1999

Results demonstrated that both neurons and astrocytes expressed specific RNA for CD137 and its protein, which was found both on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, microglia, which also expressed CD137 mRNA, showed negative immunostaining. CD137-L-specific RNA was detected only in astrocytes and neurons. When brain cells were treated with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), upregulation of CD137 but not of its ligand was observed in neurons and astrocytes. Protein localization was also affected. In microglia, an inhibition of RNA expression was induced by treatment, whereas CD137-L remained negative. Our data are the first demonstration that human brain cells express a protein found thus far in activated immunocompetent cells and epithelia. Moreover, they suggest not only that CD137 and CD137-L might play a role in interaction among human brain cells, but also that FGF-2 might have an immunoregulatory function in brain, modulating interaction of the central nervous system with peripheral immunocompetent cells.",Journal of neuroscience research,2003
1922095,"Expression of human luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor: interaction with LH and chorionic gonadotropin from human but not equine, rat, and ovine species.","Studies on human LH receptors are difficult due to the limited availability of clinical samples. Recent cloning of rat and porcine LH receptor cDNAs indicated that these binding sites are single polypeptides of the G-protein-coupled receptor family with seven transmembrane domains. Based on the conserved sequences of rat and porcine receptors, we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, using human ovarian mRNA as template and obtained partial human LH receptor cDNA clones. Further screening of a human ovary cDNA library and subsequent ligation of individual cDNA clones generated a human LH receptor cDNA containing the entire amino acid-coding region. Sequence analysis indicated that the human receptor cDNA displays 89% and 82% homology at the nucleotide level with its porcine and rat counterparts, respectively. A region spanning the second extracellular and third transmembrane domains is highly conserved among the human LH, FSH, and TSH receptors. The ovarian LH receptor clone is, however, significantly different from an incompletely spliced LH receptor cDNA recently obtained from a human thyroid library. Unlike the thyroid clone, the ovarian LH receptor cDNA could be expressed in the human fetal kidney cell line (293), and radioligand receptor assay identified high affinity (Kd, 1.2 x 10(-10) M) LH/hCG-binding sites on the plasma membrane. Binding specificity of the human LH receptor was studied using recombinant human CG, LH, and FSH secreted by CHO cells transfected with the respective genes. Human CG and LH displaced [125I]hCG binding with an ED50 of 4.3 and 4.8 ng/ml, respectively. In contrast, recombinant FSH was not effective. Treatment of transfected cells with recombinant gonadotropins also induced dose-dependent increases in extracellular cAMP production (hCG = LH much greater than FSH; ED50 25, 10, and greater than 3000 ng/ml). Although equine, rat, and ovine LH as well as equine CG competed effectively for rat testicular LH receptor binding, these hormones were unable to displace [125I]hCG binding to the human receptor, suggesting evolutionary changes in receptor binding specificity and the importance of using human receptors for clinical studies. Thus, the cloning and expression of the human LH receptor cDNA allowed analysis of interactions between human LH receptor and gonadotropins from diverse species. The present work should provide the basis for future design of therapeutic agents capable of interacting with the human receptor and for understanding the structural basis for LH receptor binding to different gonadotropins.",,

The rs368234815-ΔG allele is strongly associated with decreased clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Here, we further explored the biological function of IFN-λ4 expressed in human hepatic cells-a hepatoma cell line HepG2 and fresh primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). We performed live confocal imaging, cell death and proliferation assays, mRNA expression profiling, protein detection, and antibody blocking assays using transient and inducible stable in vitro systems. Not only did we observe significant intracellular retention of IFN-λ4 but also detected secreted IFN-λ4 in the culture media of expressing cells. Secreted IFN-λ4 induced strong activation of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in IFN-λ4-expressing and surrounding cells in transwell assays. Specifically, in PHHs, secreted IFN-λ4 induced expression of the CXCL10 transcript and a corresponding pro-inflammatory chemokine, IP-10. In IFN-λ4-expressing HepG2 cells, we also observed decreased proliferation and increased cell death. All IFN-λ4-induced phenotypes--activation of ISGs, decreased proliferation, and increased cell death--could be inhibited by an anti-IFN-λ4-specific antibody.

This study was performed to reveal the species of syndecans that interact with MK during embryogenesis of the central nervous system in the rat. Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining using antibodies to syndecans showed that syndecan-1 was strongly expressed in the brain and spinal cord of the 10-day rat fetus, and the expression became weak as embryogenesis proceeded. On the other hand, syndecan-3 expression was stronger both in the brain and spinal cord in the later developmental period (day 14-16 of gestation). No significant expression of ryudocan (syndecan-4) was detected in fetal brains by Northern blot analysis. Syndecan-3 isolated from 16-day rat fetus bound to MK strongly, as did syndecan-1 isolated from 10-day rat fetus. Thus, both syndecan-1 and syndecan-3 were considered to be involved in interaction with MK during construction of the central nervous system; syndecan-1 is expected to play important roles in the earlier periods, and syndecan-3 in the later periods.",,
10537356,"Expression of the c-erbB-3/HER-3 and c-erbB-4/HER-4 growth factor receptors and their ligands, neuregulin-1 alpha, neuregulin-1 beta, and betacellulin, in normal endometrium and endometrial cancer.","The objective of this study was to determine the immunohistochemical expression of the c-erbB-3 and c-erbB-4 growth factor receptors and their principal ligands, the neuregulins and betacellulin, in normal endometrium and determine whether there was evidence of under- or overexpression in endometrial adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed using well-characterized antibodies against each of the five proteins analyzed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival material. Forty-three normal endometrial samples (16 proliferative, 19 secretory, and 8 hyperplastic) and 41 endometrial adenocarcinoma cases were analyzed. There was variable expression of the growth factor receptors and the ligands in the two principal phases of the menstrual cycle as well as in endometrial adenocarcinoma. In normal endometrium, the c-erbB-3 receptor was weakly expressed in both phases. The c-erbB-4 receptor and all of the ligands examined, neuregulin alpha, neuregulin beta, and betacellulin, were expressed at significantly higher levels in the secretory as compared with the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, suggesting a role for these proteins in endometrial maturation. In endometrial adenocarcinoma, overexpression of c-erbB-3, c-erbB-4, and betacellulin with underexpression of neuregulin a as compared with normal controls was observed. Neuregulin beta expression was not found to be significantly different in the two groups. These results suggest that signaling through the c-erbB-3 and c-erbB-4 receptors and the ligands neuregulin alpha, neuregulin beta, and betacellulin are important in endometrial carcinogenesis.",,
12081195,Expression of the duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC) by the inflamed synovial endothelium.,"The expression of chemokine binding sites on the endothelial cells of venules in inflamed synovia was examined and whether the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC) was involved. In situ binding assays were performed to determine the expression of chemokine binding sites from rheumatoid (n = 10) and non-rheumatoid (n = 10) synovia. The expression of DARC protein and mRNA was examined by immunohistochemistry and northern blotting. The involvement of DARC in chemokine binding was studied by incubating sections with blocking antibodies to DARC (Fy3 and 6), to find out if these reduced 125I-IL-8 binding. Binding of radiolabelled chemokines IL-8, RANTES, MCP-1, but not MIP-1alpha, was found on venular endothelial cells in inflamed synovia from both rheumatoid and non-rheumatoid patients. Excess homologous unlabelled chemokine displaced binding and excess unlabelled RANTES could displace radiolabelled IL-8 binding. DARC protein expression was demonstrated on venular endothelial cells in all samples and DARC mRNA could be detected in extracts from synovia. There was downregulation of DARC protein and mRNA in rheumatoid samples. Binding of IL-8 to both rheumatoid and non-rheumatoid synovia was significantly reduced in the presence of anti-DARC Fy3 and Fy6 monoclonal antibodies. These findings show the expression of a multispecific chemokine binding site on the inflamed synovial endothelium, with evidence for involvement of DARC. This suggests a potential role for DARC in the inflammatory processes involved in synovitis.",The Journal of pathology,2002
12417446,Expression of the EGF-TM7 receptor CD97 and its ligand CD55 (DAF) in multiple sclerosis.,"CD97 is a recently identified seven-span transmembrane (7-TM) protein that is expressed by leukocytes early after activation. CD97 binds to its cellular ligand CD55 (decay accelerating factor), which protects several cell types from complement-mediated damage. The functional consequences of CD97-CD55 binding are largely unknown, but previous data imply that CD97-CD55 interactions play a role in cellular activation, migration, and adhesion under inflammatory conditions. Here we examined the expression of CD97 and CD55 by immunohistochemistry in multiple sclerosis (MS). On the basis of established criteria for inflammation and demyelination, different lesion stages were distinguished in MS post-mortem brain tissue. In normal white matter, CD97 expression was not found, but CD55 was expressed with weak staining intensity on endothelial cells. In pre-active lesions, defined by abnormalities of the white matter, many infiltrating T cells, macrophages (MPhi) and microglia expressed CD97. CD55 was highly expressed by endothelial cells. In active lesions with myelin degradation, MPhi and microglia expressed both CD55 and CD97. Furthermore, a sandwich ELISA showed significantly (p<0.05) elevated levels of soluble CD97 in serum but not in cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients (37%) compared to healthy controls (8%).Collectively, these data suggest that CD97-CD55 interactions are involved in the inflammatory processes in MS. CD55, which is expressed in lesions by vessels to protect against complement-mediated damage, might bind to CD97 on infiltrating leukocytes. This interaction may facilitate cell activation and migration through the blood-brain barrier. In addition, CD97-CD55 interactions in the parenchyma of the brain may contribute to the inflammation.",Journal of neuroimmunology,2002

11332691,Expression of VEGF-C and activation of its receptors VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 in trophoblast.,"Placental villous development requires the co-ordinated action of angiogenic factors on both endothelial and trophoblast cells. Like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF-C increases vascular permeability, stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration. In the present study, we investigated the expression of VEGF-C and its receptors VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 in normal and intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) placenta. Immunolocalisation studies showed that like VEGF and VEGFR-1, VEGF-C, VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 co-localised to the syncytiotrophoblast, to cells in the maternal decidua, as well as to the endothelium of the large placental blood vessels. Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in placental VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 protein expression in severe IUGR as compared to gestationally-matched third trimester pregnancies. Conditioned medium from VEGF-C producing pancreatic carcinoma (Suit-2) and endometrial epithelial (Hec-1B) cell lines caused an increased association of the phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) in VEGFR-3 immunoprecipitates from spontaneously transformed first trimester trophoblast cells. VEGF121 caused dose-dependant phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in trophoblast cells as well as stimulating DNA synthesis. In addition, premixing VEGF165 with heparin sulphate proteoglycan potentiated trophoblast proliferation and the association of phospho-ERK with the VEGFR-2 receptor. VEGF165-mediated DNA synthesis was inhibited by anti-VEGFR-2 neutralising antibody. The results demonstrate functional VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 receptors on trophoblast and suggest that the decreased expression of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 may contribute to the abnormal villous development observed in IUGR placenta.",Histology and histopathology,2001
12015308,Extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of endoglin interact with the transforming growth factor-beta receptors I and II.,"Endoglin is an auxiliary component of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor system, able to associate with the signaling receptor types I (TbetaRI) and II (TbetaRII) in the presence of ligand and to modulate the cellular responses to TGF-beta1. Endoglin cannot bind ligand on its own but requires the presence of the signaling receptors, supporting a critical role for the interaction between endoglin and TbetaRI or TbetaRII. This study shows that full-length endoglin interacts with both TbetaRI and TbetaRII, independently of their kinase activation state or the presence of exogenous TGF-beta1. Truncated constructs encoding either the extracellular or the cytoplasmic domains of endoglin demonstrated that the association with the signaling receptors occurs through both extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. However, a more specific mapping revealed that the endoglin/TbetaRI interaction was different from that of endoglin/TbetaRII. TbetaRII interacts with the amino acid region 437-558 of the extracellular domain of endoglin, whereas TbetaRI interacts not only with the region 437-558 but also with the protein region located between amino acid 437 and the N terminus. Both TbetaRI and TbetaRII interact with the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin, but TbetaRI only interacts when the kinase domain is inactive, whereas TbetaRII remains associated in its active and inactive forms. Upon association, TbetaRI and TbetaRII phosphorylate the endoglin cytoplasmic domain, and then TbetaRI, but not TbetaRII, kinase dissociates from the complex. Conversely, endoglin expression results in an altered phosphorylation state of TbetaRII, TbetaRI, and downstream Smad proteins as well as a modulation of TGF-beta signaling, as measured by the reporter gene expression. These results suggest that by interacting through its extracellular and cytoplasmic domains with the signaling receptors, endoglin might affect TGF-beta responses.",,

32027618,Extracellular CIRP as an endogenous TREM-1 ligand to fuel inflammation in sepsis.,"Extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) is a recently discovered damage-associated molecular pattern. Understanding the precise mechanism by which it exacerbates inflammation is essential. Here we identified that eCIRP is a new biologically active endogenous ligand of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1), fueling inflammation in sepsis. Surface plasmon resonance revealed a strong binding affinity between eCIRP and TREM-1, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay confirmed eCIRP's interaction with TREM-1 in macrophages. Targeting TREM-1 by its siRNA or a decoy peptide, LP17, or by using TREM-1-/- mice dramatically reduced eCIRP-induced inflammation. We developed a potentially novel 7-aa peptide derived from human eCIRP, M3, which blocked the interaction of TREM-1 and eCIRP. M3 suppressed inflammation induced by eCIRP or agonist TREM-1 antibody cross-linking in murine macrophages or human peripheral blood monocytes. M3 also inhibited eCIRP-induced systemic inflammation and tissue injury. Treatment with M3 further protected mice from sepsis, improved acute lung injury, and increased survival. Thus, we have discovered a potentially novel TREM-1 ligand and developed a new peptide, M3, to block eCIRP-TREM-1 interaction and improve outcomes in sepsis.",,
2254302,Extracellular domain of lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor expressed in transfected cells binds choriogonadotropin with high affinity.,"The lutropin-choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor is a cell surface receptor comprised of two domains of roughly equivalent size. The amino-terminal half of the receptor is relatively hydrophilic and is located extracellularly, whereas the carboxyl-terminal half of the receptor shares amino acid homology with other receptors that couple to G proteins and is similarly thought to span the plasma membrane seven times, ending with a relatively short carboxyl-terminal tail. In order to test the role of the extracellular domain in binding hormone, we constructed a mutated rat luteal LH/CG receptor cDNA (termed pCLHR-D2), which encodes for only the extracellular domain, and used it to transiently transfect human kidney 293 cells. Here we report that the expressed extracellular domain of the LH/CG receptor is capable of binding human CG with a high affinity, comparable with that of the full-length receptor. Thus, not only is the extracellular domain of the glycoprotein hormone receptors involved in binding hormone, but it alone is capable of conferring high affinity binding. Unexpectedly, it was also found that this truncated receptor is not secreted into the culture media but remains trapped within the cells.",,
1660465,Extracellular domain-IgG fusion proteins for three human natriuretic peptide receptors. Hormone pharmacology and application to solid phase screening of synthetic peptide antisera.,"The natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs) are a family of three cell surface glycoproteins, each with a single transmembrane domain. Two of these receptors, designated NPR-A and NPR-B, are membrane guanylyl cyclases that synthesize cGMP in response to hormone stimulation. The third receptor, NPR-C, has been reported to function in the metabolic clearance of ligand and in guanylyl cyclase-independent signal transduction. We engineered three chimeric proteins consisting of the natriuretic peptide receptor extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG-gamma 1. These molecules provide material for detailed studies of the human receptor's extracellular domain structure and interaction with the three human natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and type-C natriuretic peptide (CNP). The homodimeric fusion proteins, designated A-IgG, B-IgG, and C-IgG, were secreted from Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified by protein-A affinity chromatography. We present here the primary characterization of these fusion proteins as represented by the intrinsic hormone affinities measured by saturation binding and competition assays. The dissociation constant of 125I-ANP for A-IgG was 1.6 pM and for C-IgG, 1.2 pM. The dissociation constant of 125I-Y0-CNP (CNP with addition of tyrosine at the amino terminus) for B-IgG was 23 pM. The rank order of potency in competitive binding for A-IgG was ANP greater than BNP much greater than CNP, whereas for B-IgG the ranking was CNP much greater than ANP greater than BNP. For C-IgG, we observed ANP greater than CNP greater than or equal to BNP. These data demonstrate that the receptor-IgG fusion proteins discriminate among the natriuretic peptides in the same manner as the native receptors and provide a basis for future structural studies with these molecules. The purified fusion proteins have a variety of potential applications, one of which we illustrate by a solid phase screening assay in which rabbit sera from a series of synthetic-peptide immunizations were titered for receptor reactivity and selectivity.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1991
29059156,Extracellular matrix protein 1 promotes cell metastasis and glucose metabolism by inducing integrin β4/FAK/SOX2/HIF-1α signaling pathway in gastric cancer.,"Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) is related to strong invasiveness and poor prognosis in major malignancies, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here we aimed to elucidate the function of ECM1 on cell metastasis and glucose metabolism in gastric cancer (GC). The level of ECM1 in sera and tissues of patient with GC were positively correlated with tumor invasion and recurrence. Genetic manipulation of ECM1 expression affected cell metastasis and glucose metabolism in GC cell lines. Enhanced ECM1 expression facilitated gene expression levels associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and glucose metabolism. Interestingly, our results indicated that ECM1 directly interacted with integrin β4 (ITGB4) and activated ITGB4/focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/glycogen synthase kinase 3β signaling pathway, which further induced the expression of transcription factor SOX2. Aberrant expression of SOX2 altered gene expression of EMT factors and glucose metabolism enzymes. Furthermore, SOX2 enhanced hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIF-1α) promoter activity to regulate glucose metabolism. The micro-positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of xenograft model showed that ECM1 substantially increased",,

F-spondin is a secreted neuronal glycoprotein that localizes to the cementum. F-spondin is among the cementum-specific factors in periodontal tissue that have been reported. However, the effects of F-spondin on osteoclastogenesis have not yet been established. We examined the effects of F-spondin on stages of osteoclastogenesis, migration, and differentiation in a mouse osteoclastic precursor model, RAW 264 cells.",,
14567914,F3/contactin acts as a functional ligand for Notch during oligodendrocyte maturation.,"Axon-derived molecules are temporally and spatially required as positive or negative signals to coordinate oligodendrocyte differentiation. Increasing evidence suggests that, in addition to the inhibitory Jagged1/Notch1 signaling cascade, other pathways act via Notch to mediate oligodendrocyte differentiation. The GPI-linked neural cell recognition molecule F3/contactin is clustered during development at the paranodal region, a vital site for axoglial interaction. Here, we show that F3/contactin acts as a functional ligand of Notch. This trans-extracellular interaction triggers gamma-secretase-dependent nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain. F3/Notch signaling promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and upregulates the myelin-related protein MAG in OLN-93 cells. This can be blocked by dominant negative Notch1, Notch2, and two Deltex1 mutants lacking the RING-H2 finger motif, but not by dominant-negative RBP-J or Hes1 antisense oligonucleotides. Expression of constitutively active Notch1 or Notch2 does not upregulate MAG. Thus, F3/contactin specifically initiates a Notch/Deltex1 signaling pathway that promotes oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination.",,
29799787,FAM19A1 is a new ligand for GPR1 that modulates neural stem-cell proliferation and differentiation.,"FAM19A1 is a member of the family with sequence similarity 19 with unknown function. FAM19A1 mRNA expression is restricted to the CNS. Here, we report that FAM19A1 is a classic secretory protein, and expression levels correlate with brain development, increasing from embryonic d 12.5, peaking between postnatal d (P)1 and P7 and decreasing at wk 8. The adult hippocampus is a region of FAM19A1 high expression. Recombinant FAM19A1 suppressed the proliferation and self-renewal of neural stem cells (NSCs) and altered the lineage progression of NSCs with promoted neuron differentiation and suppressed astrocyte differentiation. Although GPCR 1 (GPR1) has been reported to be expressed in the CNS, its functions in the brain remain unclear. We identified GPR1 to be a functional receptor for FAM19A1. FAM19A1 interacted with GPR1 via the N-terminal domain (GPR1-ND), and its NSC modulatory functions required the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) /ERK1/2 and ROCK/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathways. GPR1-ND that selectively bound to FAM19A1 neutralized the effects of FAM19A1 on NSC functions. Taken together, our results show, for the first time to our knowledge, that FAM19A1 is a novel regulatory factor of the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs, and identified a novel mechanism by which GPCR mediates the effects of FAM19A1 on NSC functions that may be important for brain development and neurogenesis. Additional exploration of the functions of FAM19A1 and GPR1 in the CNS may broaden the range of therapeutic options available for major brain disorders.-Zheng, C., Chen, D., Zhang, Y., Bai, Y., Huang, S., Zheng, D., Liang, W., She, S., Peng, X., Wang, P., Mo, X., Song, Q., Lv, P., Huang, J., Ye, R.

25109685,FAM19A4 is a novel cytokine ligand of formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) and is able to promote the migration and phagocytosis of macrophages.,"FAM19A4 is an abbreviation for family with sequence similarity 19 (chemokine (C-C motif)-like) member A4, which is a secretory protein expressed in low levels in normal tissues. The biological functions of FAM19A4 remain to be determined, and its potential receptor(s) is unclarified. In this study, we demonstrated that FAM19A4 was a classical secretory protein and we verified for the first time that its mature protein is composed of 95 amino acids. We found that the expression of this novel cytokine was upregulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes and macrophages and was typically in polarized M1. FAM19A4 shows chemotactic activities on macrophages and enhances the macrophage phagocytosis of zymosan both in vitro and in vivo with noticeable increases of the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). FAM19A4 can also increase the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon zymosan stimulation. Furthermore, based on receptor internalization, radio ligand binding assays and receptor blockage, we demonstrated for the first time that FAM19A4 is a novel ligand of formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1). The above data indicate that upon inflammatory stimulation, monocyte/macrophage-derived FAM19A4 may play a crucial role in the migration and activation of macrophages during pathogenic infections.",,
29138422,"FAM19A5, a brain-specific chemokine, inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast formation through formyl peptide receptor 2.","Osteoclasts can be differentiated from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). They play a key role in bone resorption. Identifying novel molecules that can regulate osteoclastogenesis has been an important issue. In this study, we found that FAM19A5, a neurokine or brain-specific chemokine, strongly stimulated mouse BMDM, resulting in chemotactic migration and inhibition of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Expression levels of osteoclast-related genes such as RANK, TRAF6, OSCAR, TRAP, Blimp1, c-fos, and NFATc1 were markedly decreased by FAM19A5. However, negative regulators of osteoclastogenesis such as MafB and IRF-8 were upregulated by FAM19A5. FAM19A5 also downregulated expression levels of RANKL-induced fusogenic genes such as OC-STAMP, DC-STAMP, and Atp6v0d2. FAM19A5-induced inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis was significantly reversed by a formyl peptide receptor (FPR) 2 antagonist WRW4 or by FPR2-deficiency, suggesting a crucial role of FPR2 in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. Collectively, our results suggest that FAM19A5 and its target receptor FPR2 can act as novel endogenous ligand/receptor to negatively regulate osteoclastogenesis. They might be regarded as potential targets to control osteoclast formation and bone disorders.",,
15117874,Fate of internalized thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptors monitored with a timer fusion protein.,"Trafficking of TRH receptors was studied in a stable HEK293 cell line expressing receptor fused to a Timer protein (TRHR-Timer) that spontaneously changes from green to red over 10 h. Cells expressing TRHR-Timer responded to TRH with an 11-fold increase in inositol phosphate formation, increased intracellular free calcium, and internalization of 75% of bound [(3)H][N(3)-methyl-His(2)]TRH within 10 min. After a 20-min exposure to TRH at 37 C, 75-80% of surface binding sites disappeared as receptors internalized. When TRH was removed and cells incubated in hormone-free medium, approximately 75% of [(3)H][N(3)-methyl-His(2)]TRH binding sites reappeared at the surface over the next 2 h with or without cycloheximide. Trafficking of TRHR-Timer was monitored microscopically after addition and withdrawal of TRH. In untreated cells, both new (green) and old (red) receptors were seen at the plasma membrane, and TRH caused rapid movement of young and old receptors into cytoplasmic vesicles. When TRH was withdrawn, some TRHR-Timer reappeared at the plasma membrane after several hours, but much of the internalized receptor remained intracellular in vesicles that condensed to larger structures in perinuclear regions deeper within the cell. Strikingly, receptors that moved to the plasma membrane were generally younger (more green) than those that underwent endocytosis. There was no change in the red to green ratio over the course of the experiment in cells exposed to vehicle. The results indicate that, after agonist-driven receptor internalization, the plasma membrane is replenished with younger receptors, arising either from an intracellular pool or preferential recycling of younger receptors.",Endocrinology,2004
14668209,"Female sex steroid hormones and pregnancy regulate receptors for calcitonin gene-related peptide in rat mesenteric arteries, but not in aorta.","Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator neuropeptide known to be involved in the regulation of vascular tone. Results of previous studies from our laboratory and others suggest that vascular sensitivity to CGRP is enhanced during pregnancy and that the female sex steroid hormones estradiol-17beta (E2) and progesterone (P4) may be involved in this process. We hypothesized that CGRP receptors in the mesenteric artery are increased during pregnancy and with sex steroid hormone treatments. In the present study, we investigated whether pregnancy and female sex steroid hormones modulate the CGRP-receptors CGRP-A and CGRP-B in the mesenteric artery in the rat. The CGRP-A receptor consists of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1); however, the CGRP-B receptor needs to be further characterized. Messenger RNA levels for CRLR and RAMP1 were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and CGRP-B receptor proteins levels were determined by Western blot analysis. In addition, [125I]CGRP binding was measured by Scatchard analysis. Both mRNA for CGRP-A (CRLR and RAMP1) and the protein for CGRP-B receptors in mesenteric arteries were increased with pregnancy compared to nonpregnant, diestrous animals. A P4 antagonist, RU-486, downregulated and P4 upregulated these receptors in mesenteric arteries (P < 0.05) in pregnant rats. In adult ovariectomized rats, P4 upregulated CRLR and RAMP1 mRNA levels as well as [125I]CGRP-binding sites. The CGRP-B-receptor protein levels were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated by P4 and by combined E2 and P4 treatment. Together with earlier findings, these data suggest that increases in the expression of CGRP-A (CRLR and RAMP1) and CGRP-B receptors in mesenteric arteries may be important in reducing vascular resistance and in vascular adaptations that occur during pregnancy; in addition, P4 may be involved in this process.",,

30580966,Fibrinogen-like Protein 1 Is a Major Immune Inhibitory Ligand of LAG-3.,"Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) is an immune inhibitory receptor, with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) as a canonical ligand. However, it remains controversial whether MHC-II is solely responsible for the inhibitory function of LAG-3. Here, we demonstrate that fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1), a liver-secreted protein, is a major LAG-3 functional ligand independent from MHC-II. FGL1 inhibits antigen-specific T cell activation, and ablation of FGL1 in mice promotes T cell immunity. Blockade of the FGL1-LAG-3 interaction by monoclonal antibodies stimulates tumor immunity and is therapeutic against established mouse tumors in a receptor-ligand inter-dependent manner. FGL1 is highly produced by human cancer cells, and elevated FGL1 in the plasma of cancer patients is associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to anti-PD-1/B7-H1 therapy. Our findings reveal an immune evasion mechanism and have implications for the design of cancer immunotherapy.",Cell,2019
24661950,"Fibrinogen, an endogenous ligand of Toll-like receptor 4, activates monocytes in pre-eclamptic patients.","Pre-eclampsia (PE) remains the leading cause of pregnancy-associated mortality and morbidity, urging the need for a better understanding of its aetiology and pathophysiological progression. A key characteristic of PE is a systemic, exaggerated, inflammatory condition involving abnormal cytokine levels in serum, altered immune cell phenotype and Th1/Th2-type immunological imbalance. However, it is unknown how this heightened inflammatory condition manifests. We previously reported increased expression of the lipopolysaccharide receptor, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on monocytes from PE patients compared with normotensive, pregnant patients (NP). This upregulation of TLR4 on PE monocytes was accompanied by a hyper-responsiveness to bacterial TLR4 ligands. To determine whether non-microbial, endogenous TLR4 ligands also activate monocytes from PE patients, we investigated the expression of host-derived TLR4 ligands and the response of monocytes to these endogenous ligands. Plasma levels of fibrinogen - but not fibronectin or heparan sulphate - were higher in PE patients than in NP. Exposure to fibrinogen was associated with significantly increased production of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes from PE patients. Interestingly, this effect was not observed with NP monocytes. Our findings suggest that the fibrinogen-TLR4 axis might play an important role in the atypical activation of monocytes observed in PE patients that may contribute to the exaggerated inflammatory condition.",,
15781473,Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 18 signals through FGF receptor 3 to promote chondrogenesis.,"Signaling by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 18 and FGF receptor 3 (FGFR3) have been shown to regulate proliferation, differentiation, and matrix production of articular and growth plate chondrocytes in vivo and in vitro. Notably, the congenital absence of either FGF18 or FGFR3 resulted in similar expansion of the growth plates of fetal mice and the addition of FGF18 to human articular chondrocytes in culture enhanced proliferation and matrix production. Based on these and other experiments it has been proposed that FGF18 signals through FGFR3 to promote cartilage production by chondrocytes. Its role in chondrogenesis remains to be defined. In the current work we used the limb buds of FGFR3(+/+) and FGFR3(-/-) embryonic mice as a source of mesenchymal cells to determine how FGF18 signaling affects chondrogenesis. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy demonstrated impaired cartilage nodule formation in the FGFR3(-/-) cultures. Potential contributing factors to the phenotype were identified as impaired mitogenic response to FGF18, decreased production of type II collagen and proteoglycan in response to FGF18 stimulation, impaired interactions with the extracellular matrix resulting from altered integrin receptor expression, and altered expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2. The data identified FGF18 as a selective ligand for FGFR3 in limb bud mesenchymal cells, which suppressed proliferation and promoted their differentiation and production of cartilage matrix. This work, thus, identifies FGF18 and FGFR3 as potential molecular targets for intervention in tissue engineering aimed at cartilage repair and regeneration of damaged cartilage.",,
12032146,Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23 inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption by activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.,"The homeostasis of the plasma phosphate level is essential for many biological processes including skeletal mineralization. The reabsorption of phosphate in the kidney is a major determinant of the plasma levels of phosphate. Phosphatonin is a hormone-like factor that specifically inhibits phosphate uptake in renal proximal epithelial cells. Recent studies on tumor-induced osteomalacia suggested that phosphatonin was potentially identical to fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23. However, as purified recombinant FGF-23 could not inhibit phosphate uptake in renal proximal epithelial cells, the mechanism of action of FGF-23 remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we examined the mechanism of action of FGF-23 in cultured renal proximal epithelial cells, opossum kidney cells. FGF-23 was found to require heparin-like molecules for its inhibitory activity on phosphate uptake. FGF-23 binds to the FGF receptor 3c, which is mainly expressed in opossum kidney cells, with high affinity. An inhibitor for tyrosine kinases of the FGF receptor, SU 5402, blocked the activity of FGF-23. FGF-23 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is the major intracellular signaling pathway of FGF. Inhibitors of the MAPK pathway, PD98059 and SB203580, also blocked the activity of FGF-23. The present findings have revealed a novel MAPK-dependent mechanism of the regulation of phosphate uptake by FGF signaling.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002

15282281,Fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 2B: association with Nav1.6 and selective colocalization at nodes of Ranvier of dorsal root axons.,"Voltage-gated sodium channels interact with cytosolic proteins that regulate channel trafficking and/or modulate the biophysical properties of the channels. Na(v)1.6 is heavily expressed at the nodes of Ranvier along adult CNS and PNS axons and along unmyelinated fibers in the PNS. In an initial yeast two-hybrid screen using the C terminus of Na(v)1.6 as a bait, we identified FHF2B, a member of the FGF homologous factor (FHF) subfamily, as an interacting partner of Na(v)1.6. Members of the FHF subfamily share approximately 70% sequence identity, and individual members demonstrate a cell- and tissue-specific expression pattern. FHF2 is abundantly expressed in the hippocampus and DRG neurons and colocalizes with Na(v)1.6 at mature nodes of Ranvier in myelinated sensory fibers in the dorsal root of the sciatic nerve. However, retinal ganglion cells and spinal ventral horn motor neurons show very low levels of FHF2 expression, and their axons exhibit no nodal FHF2 staining within the optic nerve and ventral root, respectively. Thus, FHF2 is selectively localized at nodes of dorsal root sensory but not ventral root motor axons. The coexpression of FHF2B and Na(v)1.6 in the DRG-derived cell line ND7/23 significantly increases the peak current amplitude and causes a 4 mV depolarizing shift of voltage-dependent inactivation of the channel. The preferential expression of FHF2B in sensory neurons may provide a basis for physiological differences in sodium currents that have been reported at the nodes of Ranvier in sensory versus motor axons.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2004
1385111,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor-4 shows novel features in genomic structure, ligand binding and signal transduction.","Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) gene family consists of at least four receptor tyrosine kinases that transduce signals important in a variety of developmental and physiological processes related to cell growth and differentiation. Here we have characterized the binding of different FGFs to FGFR-4. Our results establish an FGF binding profile for FGFR-4 with aFGF having the highest affinity, followed by K-FGF/hst-1 and bFGF. In addition, FGF-6 was found to bind to FGFR-4 in ligand competition experiments. Interestingly, the FGFR-4 gene was found to encode only the prototype receptor in a region where both FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 show alternative splicing leading to differences in their ligand binding specificities and to secreted forms of these receptors. Ligands binding to FGFR-4 induced receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of a set of cellular polypeptides, which differed from those phosphorylated in FGFR-1-expressing cells. Specifically, the FGFR-1-expressing cells showed a considerably more extensive tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma than the FGFR-4-expressing cells. Structural and functional specificity within the FGFR family exemplified by FGFR-4 may help to explain how FGFs perform their diverse functions.",,

Here we describe the extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin as a binding partner of MAG. It has been identified by affinity precipitation with MAG-Fc from NG108-15 cells and by microsequencing of two peptides derived from a 210-kDa protein band. Western blot analysis showed that fibronectin is also present in MAG binding partners isolated from N(2)A (murine neuroblastoma) cells, rat brain and rat spinal cord. Different fibronectin isoforms have been isolated from brains of young and adult rats, indicating that the expression of MAG binding fibronectin changes during development.",,
2527614,"Fibulin, a novel protein that interacts with the fibronectin receptor beta subunit cytoplasmic domain.","A 100 kd protein was isolated from tissue and cell extracts by affinity chromatography on a synthetic peptide representing the cytoplasmic domain of the fibronectin receptor beta subunit. The 100 kd protein also bound to native fibronectin receptor, and this binding could be reversed with EDTA. Calcium may be the divalent cation required for the binding since the 100 kd protein was found to bind 45Ca2+. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 100 kd protein was not similar to any sequence in a protein data base. Immunofluorescent staining of cells cultured on fibronectin showed the 100 kd protein coinciding with the fibronectin receptor beta subunit in sites of substrate contact. Therefore this protein, which we term fibulin, interacts with the fibronectin receptor in vitro and associates with the receptor in vivo. Fibulin is a potential mediator of interactions between adhesion receptors and the cytoskeleton.",,

22405201,FLRT proteins are endogenous latrophilin ligands and regulate excitatory synapse development.,"Latrophilins (LPHNs) are a small family of G protein-coupled receptors known to mediate the massive synaptic exocytosis caused by the black widow spider venom α-latrotoxin, but their endogenous ligands and function remain unclear. Mutations in LPHN3 are strongly associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, suggesting a role for latrophilins in human cognitive function. Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identify the FLRT family of leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins as endogenous postsynaptic ligands for latrophilins. We demonstrate that the FLRT3 and LPHN3 ectodomains interact with high affinity in trans and that interference with this interaction using soluble recombinant LPHN3, LPHN3 shRNA, or FLRT3 shRNA reduces excitatory synapse density in cultured neurons. In addition, reducing FLRT3 levels with shRNA in vivo decreases afferent input strength and dendritic spine number in dentate granule cells. These observations indicate that LPHN3 and its ligand FLRT3 play an important role in glutamatergic synapse development.",,
21673655,FLRT2 and FLRT3 act as repulsive guidance cues for Unc5-positive neurons.,"Netrin-1 induces repulsive axon guidance by binding to the mammalian Unc5 receptor family (Unc5A-Unc5D). Mouse genetic analysis of selected members of the Unc5 family, however, revealed essential functions independent of Netrin-1, suggesting the presence of other ligands. Unc5B was recently shown to bind fibronectin and leucine-rich transmembrane protein-3 (FLRT3), although the relevance of this interaction for nervous system development remained unclear. Here, we show that the related Unc5D receptor binds specifically to another FLRT protein, FLRT2. During development, FLRT2/3 ectodomains (ECDs) are shed from neurons and act as repulsive guidance molecules for axons and somata of Unc5-positive neurons. In the developing mammalian neocortex, Unc5D is expressed by neurons in the subventricular zone (SVZ), which display delayed migration to the FLRT2-expressing cortical plate (CP). Deletion of either FLRT2 or Unc5D causes a subset of SVZ-derived neurons to prematurely migrate towards the CP, whereas overexpression of Unc5D has opposite effects. Hence, the shed FLRT2 and FLRT3 ECDs represent a novel family of chemorepellents for Unc5-positive neurons and FLRT2/Unc5D signalling modulates cortical neuron migration.",,
15147956,FLT3 ligand regulates apoptosis through AKT-dependent inactivation of transcription factor FoxO3.,"Proliferation, differentiation, and survival of hematopoietic cells are regulated by cytokines, acting through specific receptors. FLT3 ligand (FL) is one of the most important cytokines for regulation of the hematopoietic system, and its receptor FLT3 is expressed on both stem cells and progenitors. Regulation of Forkhead transcription factors has been described as an important mechanism to control apoptosis and cell cycle progression in hematopoietic progenitors. Here we report that FL induces AKT/PKB activation, which in turn phosphorylates and thereby inactivates the Forkhead protein FoxO3 in the progenitor cell line FDC-P1 stably expressing murine FLT3 receptor. Phosphorylation of AKT and FoxO3 was blocked by the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 but not by the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059. Expression of a mutated FoxO3, in which all three inhibitory phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine, led to rapid increase of apoptotic cells in the presence of FL. These results suggest that FL-induced regulation of apoptosis is executed by FoxO3.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2004
10842354,Form and function: the laminin family of heterotrimers.,"The laminins are a family of glycoproteins that provide an integral part of the structural scaffolding of basement membranes in almost every animal tissue. Each laminin is a heterotrimer assembled from alpha, beta, and gamma chain subunits, secreted and incorporated into cell-associated extracellular matrices. The laminins can self-assemble, bind to other matrix macromolecules, and have unique and shared cell interactions mediated by integrins, dystroglycan, and other receptors. Through these interactions, laminins critically contribute to cell differentiation, cell shape and movement, maintenance of tissue phenotypes, and promotion of tissue survival. Recent advances in the characterization of genetic disruptions in humans, mice, nematodes and flies have revealed developmental roles for the different laminin subunits in diverse cell types, affecting differentiation from blastocyst formation to the post-natal period. These genetic defects have challenged some of the previous concepts about basement membranes and have shed new light on the diversity and complexity of laminin functions as well as established the molecular basis of several human diseases.",Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,2000

10935626,Fringe is a glycosyltransferase that modifies Notch.,"Notch receptors function in highly conserved intercellular signalling pathways that direct cell-fate decisions, proliferation and apoptosis in metazoans. Fringe proteins can positively and negatively modulate the ability of Notch ligands to activate the Notch receptor. Here we establish the biochemical mechanism of Fringe action. Drosophila and mammalian Fringe proteins possess a fucose-specific beta1,3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity that initiates elongation of O-linked fucose residues attached to epidermal growth factor-like sequence repeats of Notch. We obtained biological evidence that Fringe-dependent elongation of O-linked fucose on Notch modulates Notch signalling by using co-culture assays in mammalian cells and by expression of an enzymatically inactive Fringe mutant in Drosophila. The post-translational modification of Notch by Fringe represents a striking example of modulation of a signalling event by differential receptor glycosylation and identifies a mechanism that is likely to be relevant to other signalling pathways.",Nature,2000
12486116,Fringe modifies O-fucose on mouse Notch1 at epidermal growth factor-like repeats within the ligand-binding site and the Abruptex region.,"Fringe plays a key role in the specification of boundaries during development by modulating the ability of Notch ligands to activate Notch receptors. Fringe is a fucose-specific beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that modifies O-fucose moieties on the epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of Notch. To investigate how the change in sugar structure caused by Fringe modulates Notch activity, we have analyzed the sites of O-fucose and Fringe modification on mouse Notch1. The extracellular domain of Notch1 has 36 tandem EGF repeats, many of which are predicted to be modified with O-fucose. We recently proposed a broadened consensus sequence for O-fucose, C(2)X(3-5)(S/T)C(3) (where C(2) and C(3) represent the second and third conserved cysteines), significantly expanding the potential number of modification sites on Notch. Here we demonstrate that sites predicted using this broader consensus sequence are modified with O-fucose on mouse Notch1, and we present evidence suggesting that the consensus can be further refined to C(2)X(4-5)(S/T)C(3). In particular, we demonstrate that EGF 12, a portion of the ligand-binding site, is modified with O-fucose and that this site is evolutionarily conserved. We also show that endogenous Fringe proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Lunatic fringe and Radical fringe) as well as exogenous Manic fringe modify O-fucose on many but not all EGF repeats of mouse Notch1. These findings suggest that the Fringes show a preference for O-fucose on some EGF repeats relative to others. This specificity appears to be encoded within the amino acid sequence of the individual EGF repeats. Interestingly, our results reveal that Manic fringe modifies O-fucose both at the ligand-binding site (EGF 12) and in the Abruptex region. These findings provide insight into potential mechanisms by which Fringe action on Notch receptors may influence both the affinity of Notch-ligand binding and cell-autonomous inhibition of Notch signaling by ligand.",,
28840375,Frizzled-5: a high affinity receptor for secreted frizzled-related protein-2 activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells c3 signaling to promote angiogenesis.,"Secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) is a pro-angiogenic factor expressed in the vasculature of a wide variety of human tumors, and modulates angiogenesis via the calcineurin-dependent nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 3 (NFATc3) pathway in endothelial cells. However, until now, SFRP2 receptor for this pathway was unknown. In the present study, we first used amino acid alignments and molecular modeling to demonstrate that SFRP2 interaction with frizzled-5 (FZD5) is typical of Wnt/FZD family members. To confirm this interaction, we performed co-immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and ELISA binding assays, which demonstrated SFRP2/FZD5 binding. Functional knock-down studies further revealed that FZD5 is necessary for SFRP2-induced tube formation and intracellular calcium flux in endothelial cells. Using protein analysis on endothelial cell nuclear extracts, we also discovered that FZD5 is required for SFRP2-induced activation of NFATc3. Our novel findings reveal that FZD5 is a receptor for SFRP2 and mediates SFRP2-induced angiogenesis via calcineurin/NFATc3 pathway in endothelial cells.",Angiogenesis,2017

We sought to (1) identify and evaluate the activation of Wnt-2 signaling through Frizzled-8 in non-small cell lung cancer, and (2) test whether a novel expression construct dominant negative Wnt-2 (dnhWnt-2) reduces tumor growth in a colony formation assay and in a xenograft mouse model.",,
12138115,Frizzled-9 is activated by Wnt-2 and functions in Wnt/beta -catenin signaling.,"Frizzled has been known to function as a Wnt receptor. Although there have been a number of mammalian Frizzled members identified, their binding specificities with Wnt and functions in mammalian cells have been poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that rat Frizzled-9 (Rfz9) functions in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in 293T cells. Rfz9 overexpression induces the hyperphosphorylation and relocalization of mouse Dishevelled-1 (Dvl-1) from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane and the accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin. Transfections of Rfz9 with each of several Wnt members show that only Wnt-2 activates Rfz9 in T cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcription. Deletion mutant analysis determines that there is a difference in Rfz9 C-terminal residues required for the modifications of Dvl-1 and those required for the inductions of beta-catenin stabilization and TCF transactivation. Deletion of the Wnt-binding domain does not abolish Rfz9 activity completely, although it causes the inactivation of Wnt-2-dependent TCF transcription. Rfz9 also relocalizes Axin from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in the presence of Dvl-1, suggesting that one of the consequences of Dvl-1 relocalization by Rfz9 is to bring Axin to the cell membrane.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002

25892522,Frizzled7 functions as a Wnt receptor in intestinal epithelial Lgr5(+) stem cells.,"The mammalian adult small intestinal epithelium is a rapidly self-renewing tissue that is maintained by a pool of cycling stem cells intermingled with Paneth cells at the base of crypts. These crypt base stem cells exclusively express Lgr5 and require Wnt3 or, in its absence, Wnt2b. However, the Frizzled (Fzd) receptor that transmits these Wnt signals is unknown. We determined the expression profile of Fzd receptors in Lgr5(+) stem cells, their immediate daughter cells, and Paneth cells. Here we show Fzd7 is enriched in Lgr5(+) stem cells and binds Wnt3 and Wnt2b. Conditional deletion of the Fzd7 gene in adult intestinal epithelium leads to stem cell loss in vivo and organoid death in vitro. Crypts of conventional Fzd7 knockout mice show decreased basal Wnt signaling and impaired capacity to regenerate the epithelium following deleterious insult. These observations indicate that Fzd7 is required for robust Wnt-dependent processes in Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells.",,

24357068,Function of Jam-B/Jam-C interaction in homing and mobilization of human and mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.,"The junctional adhesion molecules Jam-b and Jam-c interact together at interendothelial junctions and have been involved in the regulation of immune response, inflammation, and leukocyte migration. More recently, Jam-c has been found to be expressed by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in mouse. Conversely, we have reported that Jam-b is present on bone marrow stromal cells and that Jam-b-deficient mice have defects in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell pool. In this study, we have addressed whether interaction between Jam-b and Jam-c participates to HSPC mobilization or hematopoietic reconstitution after irradiation. We show that a blocking monoclonal antibody directed against Jam-c inhibits hematopoietic reconstitution, progenitor homing to the bone marrow, and induces HSPC mobilization in a Jam-b dependent manner. In the latter setting, antibody treatment over a period of 3 days does not alter hematopoietic differentiation nor induce leukocytosis. Results are translated to human hematopoietic system in which a functional adhesive interaction between JAM-B and JAM-C is found between human HSPC and mesenchymal stem cells. Such an interaction does not occur between HSPC and human endothelial cells or osteoblasts. It is further shown that anti-JAM-C blocking antibody interferes with CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor homing in mouse bone marrow suggesting that monoclonal antibodies inhibiting JAM-B/JAM-C interaction may represent valuable therapeutic tools to improve stem cell mobilization protocols.","Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",2014
9260277,Functional and receptor binding characterization of recombinant murine macrophage inflammatory protein 2: sequence analysis and mutagenesis identify receptor binding epitopes.,"Murine macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), a member of the alpha-chemokine family, is one of several proteins secreted by cells in response to lipopolysaccharide. Many of the alpha-chemokines, such as interleukin-8, gro-alpha/MGSA, and neutrophil activating peptide-2 (NAP-2), are associated with neutrophil activation and chemotaxis. We describe the expression, purification, and characterization of murine MIP-2 from Pichia pastoris. Circular dichroism spectroscopy reveals that MIP-2 exhibits a highly ordered secondary structure consistent with the alpha/beta structures of other chemokines. Recombinant MIP-2 is chemotactic for human and murine neutrophils and up-regulates cell surface expression of Mac-1. MIP-2 binds to human and murine neutrophils with dissociation constants of 6.4 nM and 2.9 nM, respectively. We further characterize the binding of MIP-2 to the human types A and B IL-8 receptors and the murine homologue of the IL-8 receptor. MIP-2 displays low-affinity binding to the type A IL-8 receptor (Kd > 120 nM) and high-affinity binding to the type B IL-8 receptor (Kd 5.7 nM) and the murine receptor (Kd 6.8 nM). The three-dimensional structure of IL-8 and sequence analysis of six chemokines (IL-8, gro-alpha, NAP-2, ENA-78, KC, and MIP-2) that display high-affinity binding to the IL-8 type B receptor are used to identify an extended N-terminal surface that interacts with this receptor. Two mutants of MIP-2 establish that this region is also involved in binding and activating the murine homologue of the IL-8 receptor. Differences in the sequence between IL-8 and related chemokines identify a unique hydrophobic/aromatic region surrounded by charged residues that is likely to impart specificity to IL-8 for binding to the type A receptor.",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,1997
9440501,Functional antagonism of the human secretin receptor by a recombinant protein encoding the N-terminal ectodomain of the receptor.,"Recent evidence indicates that the N-terminal extracellular domain of receptors in the secretin-glucagon receptor family is responsible for ligand recognition. In this report, the N-terminal ectodomain of the human secretin receptor (HSR) was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the ability of this recombinant protein to interact with secretin was investigated by functional assays. The cDNA region encoding the N-terminal ectodomain of HSR linked to the polyhistidine fusion partner was expressed in E. coli. The resulting fusion protein was purified and used for competitive studies. A permanently transfected cell line with the HSR expressed was used in this study. The cell line was able to respond to secretin leading to the elevation of both intracellular cAMP and protein kinase-A activity. Using this cell line, incubation of secretin with the recombinant protein led to a dose-dependent inhibition of both cAMP production and protein kinase-A activity. These findings strongly suggested that the N-terminal ectodomain of HSR alone can act as a functional domain that provides a means to study ligand-receptor interactions of this receptor. The His-tagged recombinant HSR ectodomain may also be used for screening secretin-specific agonists and antagonists by affinity chromatography in the future.",Receptors & signal transduction,1997
8349705,Functional characterization of a human brain cholecystokinin-B receptor. A trophic effect of cholecystokinin and gastrin.,"We have cloned a human brain cholecystokinin (CCK)-B receptor cDNA and characterized its function by introducing it into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The deduced amino acid sequence was highly conserved as compared with those of the gastrin receptors in Mastomys enterochromaffin-like cells (90%) and canine parietal cells (89%). Human brain CCK-B receptors possessed slightly but significantly higher affinities for CCK-8 than for gastrin I, while both ligands bound equally to Mastomys enterochromaffin-like cell-derived gastrin receptors. Both CCK-8 and gastrin I markedly augmented phosphoinositide hydrolysis and cytosolic free calcium levels in the CHO transfectants, indicating that the cloned CCK-B receptor could functionally couple with intracellular signaling molecules. Moreover, CCK-8 and gastrin I dose-dependently increased [3H]thymidine incorporation of the CHO transfectants in serum-free medium and promoted cell growth. The CCK-B receptor mRNA was abundantly expressed in particular areas of the human brain and stomach, such as the cerebral cortex and mucosa of the gastric fundus. This is the first demonstration of trophic effects of CCK and gastrin through the normal human brain CCK-B receptor. The availability of this receptor cDNA will help to clarify the precise role of CCK in the central nervous system as well as digestive organs.",,
11169396,Functional characterization of HLA-F and binding of HLA-F tetramers to ILT2 and ILT4 receptors.,"HLA-F is a human non-classical MHC molecule. Recombinant HLA-F heavy chain was refolded with 2-microglobulin to form a stable complex. This complex was used as an immunogen to produce a highly specific, high-affinity monoclonal antibody (FG1) that was used to study directly the cellular biology and tissue distribution of HLA-F. HLA-F has a restricted pattern of tissue expression in tonsil, spleen, and thymus. HLA-F could be immunoprecipitated from B cell lines and from HUT-78, a T cell line. HLA-F binds TAP, but unlike the classical human class I molecules, was undetected at the cell surface. HLA-F tetramers stain peripheral blood monocytes and B cells. HLA-F tetramer binding could be conferred on non-binding cells by transfection with the inhibitory receptors ILT2 and ILT4. Surface plasmon resonance studies demonstrated a direct molecular interaction of HLA-F with ILT2 and ILT4. These results, together with structural predictions based on the sequence of HLA-F, suggest that HLA-F may be a peptide binding molecule and may reach the cell surface under favorable conditions, which may include the presence of specific peptide or peptides. At the cell surface it would be capable of interacting with LIR1 (ILT2) and LIR2 (ILT4) receptors and so altering the activation threshold of immune effector cells.",European journal of immunology,2000
12857724,Functional characterization of WNT7A signaling in PC12 cells: interaction with A FZD5 x LRP6 receptor complex and modulation by Dickkopf proteins.,"WNT factors represent key mediators of many processes in animal development and homeostasis and act through a receptor complex comprised of members of the Frizzled and low density lipoprotein-related receptors (LRP). In mammals, 19 genes encoding Wingless and Int-related factor (WNTs), 10 encoding Frizzled, and 2 encoding LRP proteins have been identified, but little is known of the identities of individual Frizzled-LRP combinations mediating the effects of specific WNT factors. Additionally, several secreted modulators of WNT signaling have been identified, including at least three members of the Dickkopf family. WNT7A is a WNT family member expressed in the vertebrate central nervous system capable of modulating aspects of neuronal plasticity. Gene knock-out models in the mouse have revealed that WNT7A plays a role in cerebellar maturation, although its function in the development of distal limb structures and of the reproductive tract have been more intensely studied. To identify a receptor complex for this WNT family member, we have analyzed the response of the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 to WNT7A. We find that PC12 cells are capable of responding to WNT7A as measured by increased beta-catenin stability and activation of a T-cell factor-based luciferase reporter construct and that these cells express three members of the Frizzled family (Frizzled-2, -5, and -7) and LRP6. Our functional analysis indicates that WNT7A can specifically act via a Frizzled-5.LRP6 receptor complex in PC12 cells and that this activity can be antagonized by Dickkopf-1 and Dickkopf-3.",,
17011599,Functional differences between NPFF1 and NPFF2 receptor coupling: high intrinsic activities of RFamide-related peptides on stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding.,"By using an optimized [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, the functional activities (potency and efficacy) of peptides belonging to three members of the RFamide family; Neuropeptide FF (NPFF), prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) and 26RFamide, were investigated on NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptors stably expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Despite their large differences in affinity and selectivity, all analogues tested behaved as agonists toward NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptors. High NaCl concentration in the assay strongly increased the efficacy toward NPFF(2) receptors and augmented differences among agonists. In low sodium conditions, whereas the potencies of agonists correlated with their affinities for NPFF(1) receptors, NPFF(2) receptors exhibited an extraordinary activity since all compounds tested displayed EC(50) values of GTPgammaS binding lower than their K(I) values. Comparisons of functional values between NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptors revealed unexpected potent selective NPFF(2) agonists especially for the PLRFamide and the VGRFamide sequences. By using blocker peptides, we also show that Galpha(i3) and Galpha(s) are the main transducers of NPFF(1) receptors while NPFF(2) are probably coupled with Galpha(i2), Galpha(i3), Galpha(o) and Galpha(s) proteins. Our data indicate that NPPF(1) and NPFF(2) receptors are differently coupled to G proteins in CHO cells.",,
15341513,Functional dissociation of apelin receptor signaling and endocytosis: implications for the effects of apelin on arterial blood pressure.,"Apelin is a novel neuropeptide involved in the regulation of body fluid homeostasis and cardiovascular functions. It acts through a G protein-coupled receptor, the APJ receptor. We studied the structure-activity relationships of apelin at the rat apelin receptor, tagged at its C-terminal end with enhanced green fluorescent protein and stably expressed in CHO cells. We evaluated the potency of N- and C-terminal deleted fragments of K17F to bind with high affinity to the apelin receptor, and to inhibit cAMP production and to induce apelin receptor internalization. We first characterized the internalization and trafficking of the rat apelin receptor. This receptor was internalized via a clathrin-dependent mechanism and our results suggest that receptor trafficking may follow a recycling pathway. We then tried to identify the amino acids of K17F required for apelin activity. The first five N-terminal and the last two C-terminal amino acids of K17F were not essential for apelin binding or the inhibition of cAMP production. However, the full-length sequence of K17F was the most potent inducer of apelin receptor internalization because successive N-terminal amino-acid deletions progressively reduced internalization and the removal of a single amino acid at the C-terminus abolished this process. Finally, the most novel observation of this work is that hypotensive actions of apelin peptides correlate best with the ability of those ligands to internalize. Thus, apelin receptor signaling and endocytosis are functionally dissociated, possibly reflecting the existence of several conformational states of this receptor, stabilized by the binding of different apelin fragments to the apelin receptor.",,
7512726,Functional domains of the receptor-associated protein (RAP).,"The receptor-associated protein (RAP) specifically associates with gp330 and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), the two newest members of the LDL receptor gene family. Results obtained by ligand blotting, affinity chromatography, and density-gradient sedimentation demonstrate that RAP binds to both receptors with high affinity and that the binding is Ca2+ dependent. RAP also binds heparin and is identical to a mouse heparin binding protein (HBP-44) identified in a teratocarcinoma cell line (F9). While biochemical studies have shown that RAP is present on the cell surface and is an effective inhibitor of ligand binding to gp330 and LRP, immunocytochemical findings indicate that RAP is most abundant in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and may function in receptor folding and/or trafficking. To facilitate the characterization of RAP's function(s) we have mapped its gp330 and heparin binding sites by performing direct binding studies on fusion proteins representing overlapping domains of RAP. gp330 was found to bind to two separate sites on RAP--i.e., between amino acids 85-148 and 178-248. Binding studies with radiolabeled heparin indicate that the heparin binding site is between amino acids 261 and 323, which is consistent with our previously proposed site (residues 287-306) based on the amphipathic nature of the C terminus of RAP. These data demonstrate that the gp330 and heparin binding sites and the Heymann nephritis pathogenic epitope (amino acids 1-86) demonstrated earlier are represented by distinct domains of the RAP polypeptide.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1994
16274239,Functional effects of glycosylation at Asn-579 of the epidermal growth factor receptor.,"We have investigated functional effects of glycosylation at N(579) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Our previous study showed that the population of cell-surface expressed EGFRs in A431 cells, a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, is composed of two subpopulations that differ by glycosylation at N(579) [Zhen et al. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 5478-5492]. To characterize the subpopulation of receptors not glycosylated at N(579), we established a 32D cell line expressing a point mutant of the EGFR (N579Q), which cannot be glycosylated at this position. Analysis of epitope accessibility suggests that the lack of glycosylation at N(579) weakens auto-inhibitory tether interactions, and cross-linking experiments suggest a somewhat elevated level of preformed N579Q-EGFR dimers in the absence of ligand relative to wild-type EGFR (WT-EGFR). However, ligand drives the majority of N579Q-EGFR dimerization, suggesting that untethering, while necessary, is not sufficient to drive dimerization. Ligand-binding experiments reveal a much greater fraction of N579Q-EGFRs in a high-affinity state compared to the fraction of WT-EGFRs in a high-affinity state. However, differences in the kinetic association and dissociation rates indicate that the high-affinity states of the WT and the N579Q receptors are distinct. EGF-stimulated phosphorylation in cells expressing N579Q-EGFRs results in notable differences in the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins compared with that obtained in cells expressing WT-EGFRs. Moreover, although WT-EGFRs confer cell survival in 32D cells in the absence of interleukin-3 and EGF, we found that receptors lacking glycosylation at N(579) do not. This is the first study of which we are aware to show that selective glycosylation of a specific N-glycosylation site can produce two functionally distinct receptors.",Biochemistry,2005
8990205,"Functional expression of a novel human neurokinin-3 receptor homolog that binds [3H]senktide and [125I-MePhe7]neurokinin B, and is responsive to tachykinin peptide agonists.","In 1992, Xie et al. identified a cDNA sequence in the expression cloning search for the kappa opioid receptor. When the cDNA was expressed in Cos-7 cells, binding of opioid compounds was observed to be of low affinity and without kappa, mu, or delta selectivity [Xie, G.-X., Miyajima, A. and Goldstein, A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 4124-4128]. This cDNA was highly homologous to the human neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptor sequence, and displayed lower homology to NK-1 and NK-2 sequences. This sequence was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express neurokinin receptors naturally, and ligand binding and second messenger characteristics were compared with a human NK-3 receptor. The NK-3 receptor homolog bound [3H] senktide with a Kd of 39 nM, similar to that of the NK-3 receptor. The rank order of tachykinin peptides competing for [3H]senktide binding at the NK-3 receptor homolog was [MePhe7]neurokinin B > senktide > substance P = neurokinin A > neurokinin B. This cell line also bound [125I-MePhe7]neurokinin B; however, neurokinin B was an effective competitor. Tachykinin peptides stimulated both inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and arachidonic acid release at NK-3 and NK-3 receptor homolog cell lines, with similar rank orders of potency of [MePhe7] neurokinin B = neurokinin B = senktide > NKA = substance P. These results indicate that expression of the NK-3 receptor homolog cDNA in the Chinese hamster ovary cell system induces the expression of a receptor site with many similarities but certain key differences from that of the human NK-3 receptor. The results are discussed with reference to the existence of a novel human tachykinin receptor.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1997
10692489,Functional inactivation of the nociceptin receptor by alanine substitution of glutamine 286 at the C terminus of transmembrane segment VI: evidence from a site-directed mutagenesis study of the ORL1 receptor transmembrane-binding domain.,"A site-directed mutagenesis approach has been used to gain insight into the molecular events whereby the heptadecapeptide nociceptin binds and activates the opioid receptor-like 1 (ORL1) receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor. Alanine mutation, in the human ORL1 receptor, of transmembrane amino acid residues that are conserved in opioid receptors, Asp(130) and Tyr(131) in transmembrane segment (TM) III, Phe(220) and Phe(224) in TM V, and Trp(276) in TM VI, yields mutant receptors with reduced affinity, and proportionally decreased reactivity, toward nociceptin. Least to most deleterious in this respect are Ala substitutions of Phe(220) approximately W276A < Tyr(131) << Phe(224) </= Asp(130). The dramatic effects of the D130A mutation on nociceptin binding and activity are not reversed in the D130N mutant, whereas those of the Y131A mutation are totally suppressed in Y131F. This suggests that a negative charge at position 130, and a phenyl ring at position 131 in TM III, are critical for occupancy and/or activation of the receptor by nociceptin. Alanine replacement of glutamine 286, located at the C terminus of TM VI, yields a mutant receptor that binds nociceptin with nearly the same affinity as does the wild-type receptor (K(d) values of 0.13 and 0.22 nM, respectively) but, unlike the latter, is unable to mediate nociceptin inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP synthesis in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells (ED(50) > 10,000 nM compared with 0.8 nM at the wild-type receptor). In all respects, this mutant receptor appears to be functionally inactive, indicating that residue Gln(286) may play a pivotal role in ORL1 receptor-mediated transduction of the nociceptin signal.",,
18313787,Functional interaction between Wnt3 and Frizzled-7 leads to activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.,"The canonical Wnt signaling is frequently activated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We previously demonstrated that upregulation of Frizzled-7 receptor (FZD7) in HCC was associated with nuclear accumulation of wild-type beta-catenin. Here, we investigated Wnt ligand(s) that may activate the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway through FZD7 in HCC cells.",,
16816121,Functional interaction of VEGF-C and VEGF-D with neuropilin receptors.,"Lymphatic vascular development is regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), which is activated by its ligands VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Neuropilin-2 (NP2), known to be involved in neuronal development, has also been implicated to play a role in lymphangiogenesis. We aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which NP2 is involved in lymphatic endothelial cell signaling. By in vitro binding studies we found that both VEGF-C and VEGF-D interact with NP2, VEGF-C in a heparin-independent and VEGF-D in a heparin-dependent manner. We also mapped the domains of VEGF-C and NP2 required for their binding. The functional importance of the interaction of NP2 with the lymphangiogenic growth factors was demonstrated by cointernalization of NP2 along with VEGFR-3 in endocytic vesicles of lymphatic endothelial cells upon stimulation with VEGF-C or VEGF-D. NP2 also interacted with VEGFR-3 in coprecipitation studies. Our results show that NP2 is directly involved in an active signaling complex with the key regulators of lymphangiogenesis and thus suggest a mechanism by which NP2 functions in the development of the lymphatic vasculature.",,
9920658,Functional properties of two bombesin-like peptide receptors revealed by the analysis of mice lacking neuromedin B receptor.,"The neuromedin B-preferring receptor (NMB-R) is one of the members of the bombesin (BN)-like peptide receptor subfamily in mammals. Previously, we have generated and characterized mice with targeted disruption of the two other BN-like peptide receptors, bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS-3) and gastrin-releasing peptide-preferring receptor (GRP-R). Here we describe the generation and analysis of NMB-R-deficient mice to investigate how NMB-R differs from BRS-3 and GRP-R. Compensation for NMB-R deficiency by overexpression of GRP-R and/or BRS-3 was not detected. Although the hypothermic effect of NMB was reduced by 50% in NMB-R-deficient mice, the effect of GRP infusion was comparable to the wild-type mice. In contrast, fundic smooth muscle contraction on stimulation with NMB or GRP was normal in NMB-R-deficient mice. Administration of GRP but not NMB suppressed glucose intake in both normal and NMB-R-deficient mice. These results suggest that the NMB-R has an essential role in thermoregulation, but not for smooth muscle contraction of the fundus or for the suppression of feeding behavior. In addition, the behavioral phenotypes of GRP-R-deficient mice were not observed in NMB-R-deficient mice. These data show that the functions of NMB-R and GRP-R are distinct, with only partial overlap.",,
11055978,Functional reconstitution of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor and G(i) activation.,"On the basis of the patterns of conserved amino acid sequence, the angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor belongs to the family of serpentine receptors, which relay signals from extracellular stimuli to heterotrimeric G proteins. However, the AT(2) receptor signal transduction mechanisms are poorly understood. We have measured AT(2)-triggered activation of purified heterotrimeric proteins in urea-extracted membranes from cultured COS-7 cells expressing the recombinant receptor. This procedure removes contaminating GTP-binding proteins without inactivating the serpentine receptor. Binding studies using [(125)I] angiotensin (Ang) II revealed a single binding site with a K(d)=0.45 and a capacity of 627 fmol/mg protein in the extracted membranes. The AT(2) receptor caused a rapid activation of alpha(i) and alpha(o) but not of alpha(q) and alpha(s), as measured by radioactive guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS) binding. Activation required the presence of activated receptors, betagamma, and alpha subunits. As a first step aimed at developing an in vitro assay to examine AT(2) receptor pharmacology, we tested a battery of Ang II-related ligands for their ability to promote AT(1) or AT(2) receptor-catalyzed G(i) activation. Two proteolytic fragments of Ang II, Ang III and Ang1-7, also promoted activation of alpha(i) through the AT(2) receptor. Furthermore, we found that [Sar(1),Ala(8)]Ang II is an antagonist for both AT(1) and AT(2) receptors and that CPG42112 behaves as a partial agonist for the AT(2) receptor. In combination with previous observations, these results show that the AT(2) receptor is fully capable of activating G(i) and provides a new tool for exploring AT(2) receptor pharmacology and interactions with G-protein trimers.",Circulation research,2000
15240137,Functional redundancy of the human CCL4 and CCL4L1 chemokine genes.,"CCL4 and CCL4L1 are two CC chemokine genes located at chromosome 17q21 whose mature proteins differ at only a single amino acid. Abundant functional information exists for CCL4, however, CCL4L1 has only recently been recognized as a distinct gene, thus information describing it is wanting. The CCL4L1 protein was synthesized in Escherichia coli and compared with the CCL4 protein. Competitive binding studies using HEK-293/CCR5 cells produced comparable EC50 values for the two proteins. Similarly, chemotaxis assays with cells expressing CCR1, CCR3, or CCR5 revealed no substantial differences. CCL4L1 was somewhat more effective at inhibiting HIV-1 replication in PBMCs than was CCL4, however the difference was not statistically significant. These data combined with the observation of individual variation in CCL4L1 gene copy number [Eur. J. Immunol. 32 (2002) 3016, Genomics 83 (2004) 735] support the contention that the CCL4 and CCL4L1 proteins have redundant functions.",,
2121366,G alpha i-G alpha s chimeras define the function of alpha chain domains in control of G protein activation and beta gamma subunit complex interactions.,"Gs and Gi2 are G proteins whose alpha subunits are 65% homologous. Within the 355 amino acid alpha i2 polypeptide, substitution of residues Ile213-Lys319 with the corresponding alpha s region (Ile235-Arg356) generated a chimera that activated adenylyl cyclase, indicating that the alpha s activation domain resides within this 122 amino acid alpha s sequence. Mutation within alpha s residues Glu15-Pro144 resulted in an alpha s polypeptide having an enhanced rate of GDP dissociation. Mutation within two regions of the N-terminus influenced the ability of pertussis toxin to ADP-ribosylate the alpha subunit polypeptide, a reaction controlled by the beta gamma subunit complex. The findings define the G protein alpha subunit N-terminus as a regulatory region controlling beta gamma subunit interactions and GDP dissociation independent of the GTPase and effector activation domains.",Cell,1990
28476646,G protein-coupled receptor GPR19 regulates E-cadherin expression and invasion of breast cancer cells.,"Dysregulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including cancer initiation and progression. Within this family, approximately 140 GPCRs have no known endogenous ligands and these ""orphan"" GPCRs remain poorly characterized. The orphan GPCR GPR19 was identified and cloned 2 decades ago, but relatively little is known about its physio-pathological relevance. We observed its expression to be elevated in breast cancers and therefore sought to investigate its potential role in breast cancer pathology. In this work, we show that overexpression of GPR19 drives mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells to adopt an epithelial-like phenotype, as demonstrated by the upregulation in E-cadherin expression and changes in functional behavior. We confirm a previous report that a peptide, adropin, is an endogenous ligand for GPR19. We further show that adropin-mediated activation of GPR19 activates the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, which is essential for the observed upregulation in E-cadherin and accompanying phenotypic changes. The recapitulation of epithelial characteristics at the secondary tumor sites is now understood to be an essential step in the colonization process. Taken together our work shows for the first time that GPR19 plays a potential role in metastasis by promoting the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) through the ERK/MAPK pathway, thus facilitating colonization of metastatic breast tumor cells.",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

10689365,Galanin receptor subtypes.,"The neuropeptide galanin, which is widely expressed in brain and peripheral tissues, exerts a broad range of physiological effects. Pharmacological studies using peptide analogues have led to speculation about multiple galanin receptor subtypes. Since 1994, a total of three G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) subtypes for galanin have been cloned (GAL1, gal2 and gal3). Potent, selective antagonists are yet to be found for any of the cloned receptors. Major challenges in this field include linking the receptor clones with each of the known physiological actions of galanin and evaluating the evidence for additional galanin receptor subtypes.",,
14550305,Galectin-1 interacts with beta-1 subunit of integrin.,"Galectin-1, a beta-galactoside-binding dimeric lectin, is involved in adhesion, migration, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), the key steps in the development of atherosclerosis and restenosis. Here we investigated the molecular basis of the interactions between galectin-1 and SMCs. Galectin-1 modulated SMC attachment in a dose- and beta-galactoside-dependent manner. Direct binding of galectin-1 to beta1 integrin was detected by the immune precipitation of beta1 integrin after chemical cross-linking of 125I-labelled galectin-1 to the cell surface proteins. Galectin-1 transiently increased availability of beta1 integrins on the cell surface to antibodies against beta1 integrin. Incubation of SMCs with galectin-1 transiently increased the amount of the active form of beta1 integrin and tyrosine phosphorylation of two cytoskeleton-associated proteins; one of them coincided with focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Galectin-1 is likely to affect SMC adhesion by interacting with beta1 integrin on the cell surface of SMCs and inducing outside-in signalling.",,
10369126,"Galectin-1, a natural ligand for the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45.","Galectin-1 binds preferentially to N-acetyllactosamine residues on oligosaccharides associated with several cell surface glycoconjugates. In the present work, placental galectin-1 has been identified to be a natural ligand for the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45. The binding of galectin-1 to CD45 was detected by affinity chromatography of NP 40 solubilized Jurkat T cell membranes on galectin-1 agarose followed by immunoblotting of the galectin-1 agarose bound fraction applying monoclonal antibodies to CD45 isoforms. The PTPase activity of the galectin-1 agarose binding membrane fraction could be inhibited by sodium orthovanadate. Preincubation of Jurkat T cell membrane preparations with galectin-1 decreased the membrane-associated PTPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubation of Jurkat cells with galectin-1 suppressed the immunoprecipitated PTPase activity of CD45. Galectin-1 stimulates the cell surface expression of phosphatidylserine an early indicator of apoptosis. In CD45+ Jurkat T cells, galectin-1 induces higher levels of phosphatidylserine when compared with CD45- Jurkat cells. These observations indicate that galectin-1-mediated ligation of CD45 is involved in the induction of apoptosis in Jurkat T cells.",,
25691328,Galectin-3 Shapes Antitumor Immune Responses by Suppressing CD8+ T Cells via LAG-3 and Inhibiting Expansion of Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells.,"Galectin-3 is a 31-kDa lectin that modulates T-cell responses through several mechanisms, including apoptosis, T-cell receptor (TCR) cross-linking, and TCR downregulation. We found that patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) who responded to a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting allogeneic PDA vaccine developed neutralizing antibodies to galectin-3 after immunization. We show that galectin-3 binds activated antigen-committed CD8(+) T cells only in the tumor microenvironment. Galectin-3-deficient mice exhibit improved CD8(+) T-cell effector function and increased expression of several inflammatory genes. Galectin-3 binds to LAG-3, and LAG-3 expression is necessary for galectin-3-mediated suppression of CD8(+) T cells in vitro. Lastly, galectin-3-deficient mice have elevated levels of circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are superior to conventional dendritic cells in activating CD8(+) T cells. Thus, inhibiting galectin-3 in conjunction with CD8(+) T-cell-directed immunotherapies should enhance the tumor-specific immune response.",Cancer immunology research,2015
32664510,"Galectin-3 Stimulates Tyro3 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase and Erk Signalling, Cell Survival and Migration in Human Cancer Cells.","The TAM (Tyro3, Axl, MerTK) subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their ligands, Gas6 and protein S (ProS1), are implicated in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in various cancers. The β-galactoside binding protein galectin-3 (Gal-3), which is also implicated in oncogenesis, has previously been shown to be a ligand for MerTK. However, the selectivity of Gal-3 for the other TAM receptors, and its TAM-mediated signalling and functional properties in cancer cells, remain to be explored. The present study was aimed at determining these, including through direct comparison of Gal-3 with the two canonical TAM ligands. Exogenous Gal-3 rapidly stimulated Tyro3 receptor phosphorylation to the same extent as the Tyro3 ligand ProS1, but not Axl, in the cultured human cancer cell lines SCC-25 (express both Tyro3 and Axl) and MGH-U3 (express Tyro3 only). Gal-3 also activated intracellular Erk and Akt kinases in both cell lines and furthermore protected cells from acute apoptosis induced by staurosporine but not from serum-starvation induced apoptosis. In addition, Gal-3 significantly stimulated cancer cell migration rate in the presence of the Axl blocker BGB324. Therefore, these results have shown Gal-3 to be a novel agonist for Tyro3 RTK, activating a Tyro3-Erk signalling axis, as well as Akt signalling, in cancer cells that promotes cell survival, cell cycle progression and cell migration. These data therefore reveal a novel mechanism of Tyro3 RTK activation through the action of Gal-3 that contrasts with those of the known TAM ligands Gas6 and ProS1.",Biomolecules,2020
25065622,Galectin-9-CD44 interaction enhances stability and function of adaptive regulatory T cells.,"The β-galactoside-binding protein galectin-9 is critical in regulating the immune response, but the mechanism by which it functions remains unclear. We have demonstrated that galectin-9 is highly expressed by induced regulatory T cells (iTreg) and was crucial for the generation and function of iTreg cells, but not natural regulatory T (nTreg) cells. Galectin-9 expression within iTreg cells was driven by the transcription factor Smad3, forming a feed-forward loop, which further promoted Foxp3 expression. Galectin-9 increased iTreg cell stability and function by directly binding to its receptor CD44, which formed a complex with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor I (TGF-βRI), and activated Smad3. Galectin-9 signaling was further found to regulate iTreg cell induction by dominantly acting through the CNS1 region of the Foxp3 locus. Our data suggest that exogenous galectin-9, in addition to being an effector molecule for Treg cells, acts synergistically with TGF-β to enforce iTreg cell differentiation and maintenance.",Immunity,2014
25535338,Gas1 is a receptor for sonic hedgehog to repel enteric axons.,"The myenteric plexus of the enteric nervous system controls the movement of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal system. They extend their axons between two peripheral smooth muscle layers to form a tubular meshwork arborizing the gut wall. How a tubular axonal meshwork becomes established without invading centrally toward the gut epithelium has not been addressed. We provide evidence here that sonic hedgehog (Shh) secreted from the gut epithelium prevents central projections of enteric axons, thereby forcing their peripheral tubular distribution. Exclusion of enteric central projections by Shh requires its binding partner growth arrest specific gene 1 (Gas1) and its signaling component smoothened (Smo) in enteric neurons. Using enteric neurons differentiated from neurospheres in vitro, we show that enteric axon growth is not inhibited by Shh. Rather, when Shh is presented as a point source, enteric axons turn away from it in a Gas1-dependent manner. Of the Gαi proteins that can couple with Smo, G protein α Z (Gnaz) is found in enteric axons. Knockdown and dominant negative inhibition of Gnaz dampen the axon-repulsive response to Shh, and Gnaz mutant intestines contain centrally projected enteric axons. Together, our data uncover a previously unsuspected mechanism underlying development of centrifugal tubular organization and identify a previously unidentified effector of Shh in axon guidance.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2015

GDNFR-alpha binds GDNF specifically and mediates activation of the Ret protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK). Treatment of Neuro-2a cells expressing GDNFR-alpha with GDNF rapidly stimulates Ret autophosphorylation. Ret is also activated by treatment with a combination of GDNF and soluble GDNFR-alpha in cells lacking GDNFR-alpha, and this effect is blocked by a soluble Ret-Fc fusion protein.

11709756,Gene-gene interaction in asthma: IL4RA and IL13 in a Dutch population with asthma.,"Asthma is a common respiratory disease that is characterized by variable airways obstruction caused by acute and chronic bronchial inflammation; associated phenotypes include bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), elevated total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and skin tests positive to common allergens. Binding of interleukin-13 (IL13) or interleukin-4 (IL4) to the IL4 receptor (IL4R) induces the initial response for Th2 lymphocyte polarization. Both IL13 and IL4 are produced by Th2 cells and are capable of inducing isotype class-switching of B-cells to produce IgE after allergen exposure. These cytokines also share a common receptor component, IL4R alpha. We have investigated five IL4RA single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a population of Dutch families ascertained through a proband with asthma. By considering the probands and their spouses as an unrelated sample, we observed significant associations of atopy and asthma-related phenotypes with several IL4RA polymorphisms, including S478P and total serum IgE levels (P=.0007). A significant gene-gene interaction between S478P in IL4RA and the -1111 promoter variation in IL13, previously shown to be associated with BHR (P=.003), was detected. Individuals with the risk genotype for both genes were at almost five times greater risk for the development of asthma compared to individuals with both non-risk genotypes (P=.0004). These data suggest that variations in IL4RA contribute to elevated total serum IgE levels, and interaction between IL4RA and IL13 markedly increases an individual's susceptibility to asthma.",,
22842086,Generation of anti-Notch antibodies and their application in blocking Notch signalling in neural stem cells.,"Notch signalling occurs via direct cell-cell interactions and plays an important role in linking the fates of neighbouring cells. There are four different mammalian Notch receptors that can be activated by five cell surface ligands. The ability to inhibit specific Notch receptors would help identify the roles of individual family members and potentially provide a means to study and control cell differentiation. Anti-Notch antibodies in the form of single chain Fvs were generated from an antibody phage display library by selection on either the ligand binding domain or the negative regulatory region (NRR) of Notch1 and Notch2. Six antibodies targeting the NRR of Notch1 and four antibodies recognising the NRR of Notch2 were found to prevent receptor activation in cell-based luciferase reporter assays. These antibodies were potent, highly specific inhibitors of individual Notch receptors and interfered with endogenous signalling in stem cell systems of both human and mouse origin. Antibody-mediated inhibition of Notch efficiently down-regulated transcription of the immediate Notch target gene hairy and enhancer of split 5 (Hes5) in both mouse and human neural stem cells and revealed a redundant regulation of Hes5 in these cells as complete down-regulation was seen only after simultaneous blocking of Notch1 and Notch2. In addition, these antibodies promoted differentiation of neural stem cells towards a neuronal fate. In contrast to the widely used small molecule γ-secretase inhibitors, which block all 4 Notch receptors (and a multitude of other signalling pathways), antibodies allow blockade of individual Notch family members in a highly specific way. Specific inhibition will allow examination of the effect of individual Notch receptors in complex differentiation schemes regulated by the co-ordinated action of multiple signalling pathways.","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",2012

A single nucleotide polymorphism 1469G-->A, results in a nonconservative change in codon 3 (CXCR6-E3K) of the N-terminus of the coreceptor. To investigate the relation between the chemokine receptor CXCR6 genotype and progression to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and from PCP to death, we clinically assessed and genotyped 805 individuals from an African-American injection drug-using cohort in Baltimore, MD, USA, for this CXCR6-E3K polymorphism. The allele frequency of CXCR6-3K was high (44%) in African Americans and rare in European Americans (f<1%). Although time to AIDS and PCP was similar for all CXCR6 genotypes, the median survival time from PCP to death for the CXCR6-3E/E and CXCR6-3E/K genotype was 1.5 years compared to 3.1 years for the CXCR6-K/K genotype. Individuals homozygous or heterozygous for the CXCR6-3E allele were 5.6 times more likely to die a PCP-mediated AIDS-related death than were individuals homozygous for CXCR6-3K. This study shows an association between CXCR6 genotype and progression from PCP to death among African-Americans with HIV. We suggest that CXCR6 may play a role in late-stage HIV-1 infection and may alter the progression to death after initial infection with PCP.",,

Type-1 cytokines, particularly gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and IL-23, the major cytokines that regulate IFN-gamma production, are essential in CMI. This is illustrated by patients with unusual severe infections caused by poorly pathogenic mycobacteria and Salmonella species, in whom genetic deficiencies have been identified in several key genes in the type-1 cytokine pathway, including IL12RB1, the gene encoding the beta1 chain of the IL-12 and IL-23 receptors. Several mutations in IL12RB1 with deleterious effects on human IL-12R function have been identified, including nonsense and missense mutations. In addition, a number of coding IL12RB1 polymorphisms have been reported. In order to gain more insight into the effect that IL12RB1 mutations and genetic variations can have on IL-12Rbeta1 function, three approaches have been followed. First, we determined the degree of conservation at the variant amino acid positions in IL-12Rbeta1 between different species, using known deleterious mutations, known variations in IL-12Rbeta1, as well as novel coding variations that we have identified at position S74R and R156H. Second, we analyzed the potential impact of these amino acid variations on the three-dimensional structure of the IL-12Rbeta1 protein. Third, we analyzed the putative functions of different IL-12Rbeta1 domains, partly based on their homology with gp130, and analyzed the possible effects of the above amino acid variations on the function of these domains. Based on these analyses, we propose an integrated model of IL-12Rbeta1 structure and function.

9872321,Genomic amplification of a decoy receptor for Fas ligand in lung and colon cancer.,"Fas ligand (FasL) is produced by activated T cells and natural killer cells and it induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in target cells through the death receptor Fas/Apol/CD95. One important role of FasL and Fas is to mediate immune-cytotoxic killing of cells that are potentially harmful to the organism, such as virus-infected or tumour cells. Here we report the discovery of a soluble decoy receptor, termed decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), that binds to FasL and inhibits FasL-induced apoptosis. The DcR3 gene was amplified in about half of 35 primary lung and colon tumours studied, and DcR3 messenger RNA was expressed in malignant tissue. Thus, certain tumours may escape FasL-dependent immune-cytotoxic attack by expressing a decoy receptor that blocks FasL.",,
9482105,Genomic structure and chromosomal localization of the human GDNFR-alpha gene.,"GDNFR-alpha is a glycosyl-phosphotidylinositol-linked receptor for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). GDNF binds to GDNFR-alpha and this complex, in turn, is believed to interact with the RET receptor tyrosine kinase to effect downstream signalling. GDNFR-alpha belongs to a novel gene family without strong homology to known genes. Thus, little information has been available to help predict genomic structure or location of this gene. In this study, the genomic organization of human GDNFR-alpha was delineated through a combination of PAC clone characterization, long distance PCR and sequence analyses. Exon-intron boundaries were defined by comparing the size and sequence of the genomic PCR products to those predicted by the cDNA sequence. The human GDNFR-alpha gene comprises 9 exons. GDNFR-alpha PAC clones were used for FISH analysis to map this gene to 10q26.",Oncogene,1998
28846099,GFRAL is the receptor for GDF15 and is required for the anti-obesity effects of the ligand.,"Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15; also known as MIC-1) is a divergent member of the TGF-β superfamily and is associated with body-weight regulation in humans and rodents. However, the cognate receptor of GDF15 is unknown. Here we show that GDF15 binds specifically to GDNF family receptor α-like (GFRAL) with high affinity, and that GFRAL requires association with the coreceptor RET to elicit intracellular signaling in response to GDF15 stimulation. We also found that GDF15-mediated reductions in food intake and body weight of mice with obesity were abolished in GFRAL-knockout mice. We further found that GFRAL expression was limited to hindbrain neurons and not present in peripheral tissues, which suggests that GDF15-GFRAL-mediated regulation of food intake is by a central mechanism. Lastly, given that GDF15 did not increase energy expenditure in treated mice with obesity, the anti-obesity actions of the cytokine are likely driven primarily by a reduction in food intake.",Nature medicine,2017
28846097,GFRAL is the receptor for GDF15 and the ligand promotes weight loss in mice and nonhuman primates.,"Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a distant member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family, is a secreted protein that circulates as a 25-kDa dimer. In humans, elevated GDF15 correlates with weight loss, and the administration of GDF15 to mice with obesity reduces body weight, at least in part, by decreasing food intake. The mechanisms through which GDF15 reduces body weight remain poorly understood, because the cognate receptor for GDF15 is unknown. Here we show that recombinant GDF15 induces weight loss in mice fed a high-fat diet and in nonhuman primates with spontaneous obesity. Furthermore, we find that GDF15 binds with high affinity to GDNF family receptor α-like (GFRAL), a distant relative of receptors for a distinct class of the TGF-β superfamily ligands. Gfral is expressed in neurons of the area postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract in mice and humans, and genetic deletion of the receptor abrogates the ability of GDF15 to decrease food intake and body weight in mice. In addition, diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance are exacerbated in GFRAL-deficient mice, suggesting a homeostatic role for this receptor in metabolism. Finally, we demonstrate that GDF15-induced cell signaling requires the interaction of GFRAL with the coreceptor RET. Our data identify GFRAL as a new regulator of body weight and as the bona fide receptor mediating the metabolic effects of GDF15, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of GDF15 as a potential pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obesity.",Nature medicine,2017
9407096,GFRalpha-2 and GFRalpha-3 are two new receptors for ligands of the GDNF family.,"The receptor for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) consists of GFRalpha-1 and Ret. Neurturin is a GDNF-related neurotrophin whose receptor is presently unknown. Here we report that neurturin can bind to either GFRalpha-1 or GFRalpha-2, a novel receptor related to GFRalpha-1. Both GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 mediate neurturin-induced Ret phosphorylation. GDNF can also bind to either GFRalpha-1 or GFRalpha-2, and activate Ret in the presence of either binding receptor. Although both ligands interact with both receptors, cells expressing GFRalpha-1 bind GDNF more efficiently than neurturin, while cells expressing GFRalpha-2 bind neurturin preferentially. Cross-linking and Ret activation data also suggest that while there is cross-talk, GFRalpha-1 is the primary receptor for GDNF and GFRalpha-2 exhibits a preference for neurturin. We have also cloned a cDNA that apparently codes for a third member of the GFRalpha receptor family. This putative receptor, designated GFRalpha-3, is closely related in amino acid sequence and is nearly identical in the spacing of its cysteine residues to both GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2. Analysis of the tissue distribution of GFRalpha-1, GFRalpha-2, GFRalpha-3, and Ret by Northern blot reveals overlapping but distinct patterns of expression. Consistent with a role in GDNF function, the GFRalphas and Ret are expressed in many of the same tissues, suggesting that GFRalphas mediate the action of GDNF family ligands in vivo.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
10604470,Ghrelin is a growth-hormone-releasing acylated peptide from stomach.,"Small synthetic molecules called growth-hormone secretagogues (GHSs) stimulate the release of growth hormone (GH) from the pituitary. They act through GHS-R, a G-protein-coupled receptor for which the ligand is unknown. Recent cloning of GHS-R strongly suggests that an endogenous ligand for the receptor does exist and that there is a mechanism for regulating GH release that is distinct from its regulation by hypothalamic growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). We now report the purification and identification in rat stomach of an endogenous ligand specific for GHS-R. The purified ligand is a peptide of 28 amino acids, in which the serine 3 residue is n-octanoylated. The acylated peptide specifically releases GH both in vivo and in vitro, and O-n-octanoylation at serine 3 is essential for the activity. We designate the GH-releasing peptide 'ghrelin' (ghre is the Proto-Indo-European root of the word 'grow'). Human ghrelin is homologous to rat ghrelin apart from two amino acids. The occurrence of ghrelin in both rat and human indicates that GH release from the pituitary may be regulated not only by hypothalamic GHRH, but also by ghrelin.",Nature,1999
12409230,"GIP, a G-protein-coupled receptor interacting protein.","A novel protein was cloned while screening for partners interacting with the second intracellular loop of the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R). The protein was named GIP as in G-protein-coupled receptor Interacting Protein; the corresponding gene was located on the 17th chromosome where three exons encode for a 379-amino-acid protein.GIP subcellular localization was studied by immunocytochemistry and also using a biotinylating agent. The protein was found to be localized, at least in part, on the plasma membrane, probably in the form of a trimer. The results indicated that GIP is a transmembrane protein and the most part of the molecule is intracellular. Sequence homology inferred that GIP cytosolic domain is folded as a collagen-like helix followed by a globular domain. The interaction of the globular domain with the V2R was confirmed by pull-down experiments indicating that this structural motif can also interact with cytosolic proteins.",,
11313993,Glial tumor cell adhesion is mediated by binding of the FNIII domain of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta (RPTPbeta) to tenascin C.,"The extracellular domain of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta (RPTPbeta) is composed of several domains which mediate its interactions with distinct ligands present on the surface of either neurons or glial cells. Here, we demonstrate that the fibronectin type III domain (FNIII) of RPTPbeta binds to glial tumor-derived cell lines and primary astrocytes. We used affinity purification to isolate several proteins that specifically bind to the FNIII domain of RPTPbeta. One of these, a 240 kDa protein that was purified from U118MG glioblastoma cell, was identified as tenascin C based on the amino acid sequence of several tryptic peptides. The interaction of RPTPbeta with tenascin C was found to mediate cell adhesion. Adhesion and spreading of SF763T astrocytoma cells expressing RPTPbeta on tenascin C was specifically abolished by the addition of a soluble fragment containing the FNIII domain of the receptor. RPTPbeta-dependent cell adhesion was mediated by binding to the alternatively spliced FNIII repeats A1,2,4 (TnfnA1,2,4) of tenascin C. Furthermore, COS cells expressing RPTPbeta adhere to TnfnA1,2,4, while the parental cells did not. These results demonstrate that the FNIII domain of RPTPbeta binds to tenascin C and suggest that RPTPbeta present on glial tumor cells is a primary adhesion receptor system to the extracellular matrix.",,
8795084,GLP-1/GIP chimeric peptides define the structural requirements for specific ligand-receptor interaction of GLP-1.,"The gastrointestinal hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) strongly stimulate insulin release. Despite their high N-terminal sequence similarity, GLP-1 does not bind to the GIP receptor and vice versa. To characterize the domains required for interaction of the peptide ligands with their specific receptors, we performed displacement studies with various synthetic GLP-1/GIP hybrid peptides on RINm5F insulinoma cells. Displacement of 125I-GIP and 125I-GLP-1 was measured using GLP-1/GIP chimeras which comprised GIP and GLP-1 sequences at different positions. The binding affinity to the GLP-1 receptor was found to be sensitive to GIP-like exchanges in the N-terminal 22 amino acids as well as in positions 13 and 15 (loss of affinity 280-fold to more than 1000-fold). C-terminal substitution of the GLP-1 sequence by GIP diminished the affinity towards the GLP-1 receptor only 20-fold. All hybrid peptides investigated showed minimal binding affinity for the GIP receptor, indicating that the entire GIP-sequence (1-31) is important for receptor recognition. These findings provide insight into the structural requirements for the specific interaction of two important insulinotropic peptides with their specific receptors.",,
1908089,Glucagon induces disaggregation of polymer-like structures of the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein in liver membranes.,"The hydrodynamic behavior of G alpha s, the alpha subunit of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein), in octyl glucoside extracts of rat liver membranes was investigated. As was previously shown for G proteins similarly extracted from brain synaptoneurosomes, G alpha s behaved as polydisperse structures with S values higher than that of heterotrimeric G proteins. At concentrations of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]) greater than 100 microM, incubation with membranes led to smaller structures having S values in the range of 4-5 S. Incubation of liver membranes with glucagon also caused a marked increase in structures having these S values; glucagon action required the presence of low concentrations of GTP[gamma S] (maximal, 10 microM), was rapid (within 10 sec), and was not observed with vasopressin, angiotensin II, or glucagon-(19-29). When G alpha s in its membrane-bound form was [32P]ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin and the treated membranes were extracted with octyl glucoside, greater than 35% of the labeled G alpha s was found in material that sedimented through sucrose gradients and contained relatively low levels of immunoreactive G alpha s. Glucagon selectively converted the apparently large molecular weight structures to the 4-5 S structures in the presence of GTP[gamma S], even at 1 mM (the maximal effect of the nucleotide alone), when incubated with the toxin-treated membranes. These findings suggest that the glucagon receptor selectively interacts with polymer-like structures of G alpha s and that activation by GTP[gamma S] results in disaggregation. The role of the beta and gamma subunits of G proteins in the hormone-induced process is not clear since the polymer-like structures extracted with octyl glucoside are devoid of beta and gamma subunits.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1991
4305077,Glucagon-sensitive adenyl cylase in plasma membrane of hepatic parenchymal cells.,"The plasma membrane of hepatic parenchymal cells contains an adenyl cyclase system that is stimulated by glucagon. Adrenocorticotropin and epinephrine do not stimulate this adenyl cyclase, and very little cyclic phospho-diesterase activity is present in the membrane. These findings support the concept that glucagon exerts its regulatory action in the liver by stimulating adenyl cyclase activity in the plasma membrane.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1969
10600606,Glycans and proteoglycans are involved in the interactions of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein and of SDF-1alpha with membrane ligands of CD4(+) CXCR4(+) cells.,"We demonstrate that human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1(LAI) envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp120(LAi)) specifically interacts with several membrane ligands on lymphoid CEM or monocytic U937 cells in addition to its previously identified receptor, CD4, and CXCR4, its coreceptor. In its native state, gp120(LAI) is able to elicit specific multimolecular complexes with these membrane ligands at the surface of the cells; most of the interactions are abolished by mannan or heparin but not by dextran. Similarly, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha interacts not only with CXCR4 expressed by CXCR4(+) CD4(+) U937, CEM, and HOS-CD4(+) CXCR4(+) cells but also with CD4 expressed by intact U937, CEM, and HOS-CD4(+) CXCR4(+/-) cells or electroblotted onto Immobilon. SDF-1alpha binding to CD4(+) CXCR4(+/-) cells, or soluble CD4 electroblotted onto Immobilon, is significantly inhibited by sCD4, whereas truncated sCD4 lacking D3 and D4 domains had no significant effect, which indicates that SDF-1 binds to CD4 but at regions different from the HIV-gp120-binding site. Heparin and mannan also inhibit SDF-1alpha binding to intact CD4(+) CXCR4(+/-) cells, and electroblotted soluble CD4. Heparitinase treatment of such cells reduced SDF-1alpha binding. These data demonstrate that glycans and glycosaminoglycans are directly or indirectly involved in the interactions of HIV-1 gp120(LAI) and of SDF-1alpha with membrane ligands of CD4(+) CXCR4(+) cells and thus could play a role both in HIV-1 infection and in the physiology of SDF-1alpha.",,
7686151,"Glycoprotein 330, a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, binds lipoprotein lipase in vitro.","Glycoprotein 330 (gp330), a cell-surface protein that is localized in clathrin-coated pits, is structurally related to both the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the LDLR-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP). We recently demonstrated that gp330 and LRP may be functionally related as well; both bind the 39-kDa polypeptide referred to as receptor-associated protein (Kounnas, M. Z., Argraves, W. S., and Strickland, D. K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21162-21166). In this report, we tested several other LRP ligands for their ability to interact with human and rat gp330 in vitro. Gp330 did not exhibit detectable binding to the LRP ligands, alpha 2-macroglobulin protease complex or Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A. However, we found that gp330 (purified from human or rat) bound the lipolytic enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) with high affinity (Kd = 6.1 and 2.7 nM, respectively). The binding was saturable, divalent cation dependent, and inhibited by heparin or receptor-associated protein. Because LRP has also been shown to bind LPL, the present findings further extend the functional similarities between gp330 and LRP. By analogy to the postulated role of the LRP-LPL interaction in facilitating hepatic clearance of LPL-associated lipoproteins from the blood (Beisiegel, U., Weber, W., and Bengtsson-Olivercrona, G. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 8342-8346; Chappell, D. A., Fry, G. L., Waknitz, M. A., Iverius, P. H., Williams, S. E., and Strickland, D. K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25764-25767), we speculate that the gp330-LPL interaction described herein may contribute to the uptake of LPL-associated lipoproteins in tissues expressing gp330. Consistent with this possibility, we found that LPL promoted in vitro binding of 125I-lipoproteins to gp330.",,
16763549,Glycosaminoglycan modification of neuropilin-1 modulates VEGFR2 signaling.,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that enhances the angiogenic signals cooperatively with VEGFR2. VEGF signaling is essential for physiological and pathological angiogenesis through its effects on vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), but the mechanisms coordinating this response are not well understood. Here we show that a substantial fraction of NRP1 is proteoglycan modified with either heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate on a single conserved Ser. The composition of the NRP1 glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains differs between ECs and SMCs. Glycosylation increased VEGF binding in both cell types, but the differential GAG composition of NRP1 mediates opposite responsiveness to VEGF in ECs and SMCs. Finally, NRP1 expression and its GAG modification post-transcriptionally regulate VEGFR2 protein expression. These findings indicate that GAG modification of NRP1 plays a critical role in modulating VEGF signaling, and may provide new insights into physiological and pathological angiogenesis.",,
17403372,Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 plays a critical role in the lipolytic processing of chylomicrons.,"The triglycerides in chylomicrons are hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LpL) along the luminal surface of the capillaries. However, the endothelial cell molecule that facilitates chylomicron processing by LpL has not yet been defined. Here, we show that glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) plays a critical role in the lipolytic processing of chylomicrons. Gpihbp1-deficient mice exhibit a striking accumulation of chylomicrons in the plasma, even on a low-fat diet, resulting in milky plasma and plasma triglyceride levels as high as 5000 mg/dl. Normally, Gpihbp1 is expressed highly in heart and adipose tissue, the same tissues that express high levels of LpL. In these tissues, GPIHBP1 is located on the luminal face of the capillary endothelium. Expression of GPIHBP1 in cultured cells confers the ability to bind both LpL and chylomicrons. These studies strongly suggest that GPIHBP1 is an important platform for the LpL-mediated processing of chylomicrons in capillaries.",,
15084524,Glypican-1 as an Abeta binding HSPG in the human brain: its localization in DIG domains and possible roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.,"Previous studies have suggested that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play a role in deposition of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. In the present study, we demonstrated that glypican-1 can bind fibrillar Abeta, and the binding is mainly mediated by heparan sulfate (HS) chains. Further analysis revealed that glypican-1 is the major HSPG localized in detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched (DIG) domains where all machineries for Abeta production exist and Abeta is accumulated as monomeric and oligomeric forms. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that glypican-1 is localized in primitive plaques as well as classic plaques. Moreover, overexpression of glypican-1 and amyloid precursor protein in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in reduced cell viability and made cells more susceptible to thapsigargin-induced stress and Abeta toxicity. The results raise the possibility that glypican-1 interacts with oligomerized or polymerized Abeta in such a specific compartment as DIG, resulting not only in amyloid deposition in senile plaques of AD brain, but also in accelerating neuronal cell death in response to stress and Abeta.",,
10196157,Glypican-1 is a VEGF165 binding proteoglycan that acts as an extracellular chaperone for VEGF165.,"Glypican-1 is a member of a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans implicated in the control of cellular growth and differentiation. The 165-amino acid form of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) is a mitogen for endothelial cells and a potent angiogenic factor in vivo. Heparin binds to VEGF165 and enhances its binding to VEGF receptors. However, native HSPGs that bind VEGF165 and modulate its receptor binding have not been identified. Among the glypicans, glypican-1 is the only member that is expressed in the vascular system. We have therefore examined whether glypican-1 can interact with VEGF165. Glypican-1 from rat myoblasts binds specifically to VEGF165 but not to VEGF121. The binding has an apparent dissociation constant of 3 x 10(-10) M. The binding of glypican-1 to VEGF165 is mediated by the heparan sulfate chains of glypican-1, because heparinase treatment abolishes this interaction. Only an excess of heparin or heparan sulfates but not other types of glycosaminoglycans inhibited this interaction. VEGF165 interacts specifically not only with rat myoblast glypican-1 but also with human endothelial cell-derived glypican-1. The binding of 125I-VEGF165 to heparinase-treated human vascular endothelial cells is reduced following heparinase treatment, and addition of glypican-1 restores the binding. Glypican-1 also potentiates the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to a soluble extracellular domain of the VEGF receptor KDR/flk-1. Furthermore, we show that glypican-1 acts as an extracellular chaperone that can restore the receptor binding ability of VEGF165, which has been damaged by oxidation. Taken together, these results suggest that glypican-1 may play an important role in the control of angiogenesis by regulating the activity of VEGF165, a regulation that may be critical under conditions such as wound repair, in which oxidizing agents that can impair the activity of VEGF are produced, and in situations were the concentrations of active VEGF are limiting.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
20689858,"Glypican-1, phosphacan/receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase-ζ/β and its ligand, tenascin-C, are expressed by neural stem cells and neural cells derived from embryonic stem cells.","The heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1, the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan phosphacan/RPTP (receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase)-zeta/beta and the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C were all found to be expressed by neural stem cells and by neural cells derived from them. Expression of proteoglycans and tenascin-C increased after retinoic acid induction of SSEA1-positive ES (embryonic stem) cells to nestin-positive neural stem cells, and after neural differentiation, proteoglycans and tenascin-C are expressed by both neurons and astrocytes, where they surround cell bodies and processes and in certain cases show distinctive expression patterns. With the exception of tenascin-C (whose expression may decrease somewhat), expression levels do not change noticeably during the following 2 weeks in culture. The significant expression, by neural stem cells and neurons and astrocytes derived from them, of two major heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of nervous tissue and of tenascin-C, a high-affinity ligand of phosphacan/RPTP-zeta/beta, indicates that an understanding of their specific functional roles in stem cell neurobiology will be important for the therapeutic application of this new technology in facilitating nervous tissue repair and regeneration.",ASN neuro,2010
18413366,Glypican-3-mediated oncogenesis involves the Insulin-like growth factor-signaling pathway.,"Glypican-3 (gpc3) is the gene responsible for Simpson-Golabi-Behmel overgrowth syndrome. Previously, we have shown that GPC3 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we demonstrated the mechanisms for GPC3-mediated oncogenesis. Firstly, GPC3 overexpression in NIH3T3 cells gave to cancer cell phenotypes including growing in serum-free medium and forming colonies in soft agar, or on the other way, GPC3 knockdown in HuH-7 cells decreased oncogenecity. We further demonstrated that GPC3 bound specifically through its N-terminal proline-rich region to both Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II and IGF-1R. GPC3 stimulated the phosphorylation of IGF-1R and the downstream signaling molecule extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in an IGF-II-dependent way. Also, GPC3 knockdown in HCC cells decreased the phosphorylation of both IGF-1R and ERK. Therefore, GPC3 confers oncogenecity through the interaction between IGF-II and its receptor, and the subsequent activation of the IGF-signaling pathway. This data are novel to the current understanding of the role of GPC3 in HCC and will be important in future developments of cancer therapy.",,
11066092,Glypican-4 is an FGF2-binding heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed in neural precursor cells.,"FGF2 is a crucial mitogen for neural precursor cells in the developing cerebral cortex. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are thought to play a role in cortical neurogenesis by regulating the action of FGF2 on neural precursor cells. In this article, we present data indicating that glypican-4 (K-glypican), a GPI-anchored cell surface HSPG, is involved in these processes. In the developing mouse brain, glypican-4 mRNA is expressed predominantly in the ventricular zone of the telencephalon. Neither the outer layers of the telencephalic wall nor the ventricular zone of other parts of the developing brain express significant levels of glypican-4, with the exception of the ventricular zone of the tectum. In cultures of E13 rat cortical precursor cells, glypican-4 is expressed in cells immunoreactive for nestin and the D1.1 antigen, markers of neural precursor cells. Glypican-4 expression was not detected in early postmitotic or fully differentiated neurons. Recombinant glypican-4 produced in immortalized neural precursor cells binds FGF2 through its heparan sulfate chains and suppressed the mitogenic effect of FGF2 on E13 cortical precursor cells. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of glypican-4 in the developing cerebral wall significantly overlaps with that of FGF2. These results suggest that glypican-4 plays a critical role in the regulation of FGF2 action during cortical neurogenesis.",,
21339334,Glypican-5 stimulates rhabdomyosarcoma cell proliferation by activating Hedgehog signaling.,"Glypican-5 (GPC5) is one of the six members of the glypican family. It has been previously reported that GPC5 stimulates the proliferation of rhabdomyosarcoma cells. In this study, we show that this stimulatory activity of GPC5 is a result of its ability to promote Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. We have previously shown that GPC3, another member of the glypican family, inhibits Hh signaling by competing with Patched 1 (Ptc1) for Hh binding. Furthermore, we showed that GPC3 binds to Hh through its core protein but not to Ptc1. In this paper, we demonstrate that GPC5 increases the binding of Sonic Hh to Ptc1. We also show that GPC5 binds to both Hh and Ptc1 through its glycosaminoglycan chains and that, unlike GPC3, GPC5 localizes to the primary cilia. Interestingly, we found that the heparan sulfate chains of GPC5 display a significantly higher degree of sulfation than those of GPC3. Based on these results, we propose that GPC5 stimulates Hh signaling by facilitating/stabilizing the interaction between Hh and Ptc1.",,
19638591,"GnRH-II antagonists induce apoptosis in human endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer cells via activation of stress-induced MAPKs p38 and JNK and proapoptotic protein Bax.","Recently, we could show that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-II antagonists induce apoptosis in human endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we have ascertained receptor binding and effects of GnRH-II antagonists on mitogenic signal transduction and on activation of proapoptotic protein Bax. The GnRH-II antagonists tested showed EC50 values for GnRH-I receptor binding in the range of 1 to 2 nmol/L. The GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II showed an EC50 value for GnRH-I receptor binding of approximately 1,000 nmol/L. Agonistic activity on GnRH-I receptor function with an EC50 of 13 nmol/L has been determined for [D-Lys6]GnRH-II. Antagonistic activities with EC50 values in the range of 1 nmol/L were determined for the GnRH-II antagonists. Treatment of human endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer cells with GnRH-II antagonists resulted in time-dependent activation of stress-induced mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. In addition, treatment with GnRH-II antagonists induced time-dependent activation of proapoptotic protein Bax. GnRH-II antagonists are not involved in activation of protein kinase B/Akt or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. The GnRH-II antagonists tested had similar binding affinities to the GnRH-I receptor comparable with that of GnRH-I antagonist Cetrorelix. Referring to the cyclic AMP response element reporter gene activation assay, the GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II has to be classified as an agonist at the GnRH-I receptor, whereas the GnRH-II antagonists tested are clear antagonists at the GnRH-I receptor. GnRH-II antagonists induce apoptotic cell death in human endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer cells via activation of stress-induced mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase followed by activation of proapoptotic protein Bax.",Cancer research,2009
7516405,gp39-CD40 interactions are essential for germinal center formation and the development of B cell memory.,"gp39, the ligand for CD40 expressed on activated CD4+ T helper cells, is required for the generation of antibody responses to T-dependent (TD) antigens. Treatment of mice with anti-gp39 in vivo inhibits both primary and secondary antibody formation to TD, but not T-independent antigens. However, the role of this receptor-ligand pair in the development of germinal centers and the generation of B cell memory is as yet undefined. Using an antibody to gp39, this study examines the in vivo requirement for gp39-CD40 interactions in the induction of germinal center formation, as well as in the generation of B cell memory. Animals were immunized, treated in vivo with anti-gp39, and evaluated using immunohistochemical staining for the presence of splenic germinal centers 9-11 d after immunization. The results demonstrate that the formation of germinal centers was completely inhibited as a result of treatment with anti-gp39. Moreover, adoptive transfer experiments demonstrate that the generation of antigen-specific memory B cells is also inhibited as a consequence of blocking gp39-CD40 interactions. Taken together, the data demonstrate that gp39-CD40 interactions are critical not only for the generation of antibody responses, but also in the development of B cell memory.",,

In the present study, we used a combination of ligand-binding and receptor-activity assays to characterize a Gαi/o protein-coupled receptor activated by BigLEN in the mouse hypothalamus and Neuro2A cells. We then selected orphan G protein-coupled receptors expressed in the hypothalamus and Neuro2A cells and tested each for activation by BigLEN. G protein-coupled receptor 171 (GPR171) is activated by BigLEN, but not by the C terminally truncated peptide LittleLEN. The four C-terminal amino acids of BigLEN are sufficient to bind and activate GPR171. Overexpression of GPR171 leads to an increase, and knockdown leads to a decrease, in binding and signaling by BigLEN and the C-terminal peptide. In the hypothalamus GPR171 expression complements the expression of BigLEN, and its level and activity are elevated in mice lacking BigLEN. In mice, shRNA-mediated knockdown of hypothalamic GPR171 leads to a decrease in BigLEN signaling and results in changes in food intake and metabolism. The combination of GPR171 shRNA together with neutralization of BigLEN peptide by antibody absorption nearly eliminates acute feeding in food-deprived mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that GPR171 is the BigLEN receptor and that the BigLEN-GPR171 system plays an important role in regulating responses associated with feeding and metabolism in mice.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2013
23690594,GPR37 and GPR37L1 are receptors for the neuroprotective and glioprotective factors prosaptide and prosaposin.,"GPR37 (also known as Pael-R) and GPR37L1 are orphan G protein-coupled receptors that are almost exclusively expressed in the nervous system. We screened these receptors for potential activation by various orphan neuropeptides, and these screens yielded a single positive hit: prosaptide, which promoted the endocytosis of GPR37 and GPR37L1, bound to both receptors and activated signaling in a GPR37- and GPR37L1-dependent manner. Prosaptide stimulation of cells transfected with GPR37 or GPR37L1 induced the phosphorylation of ERK in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner, stimulated (35)S-GTPγS binding, and promoted the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. Because prosaptide is the active fragment of the secreted neuroprotective and glioprotective factor prosaposin (also known as sulfated glycoprotein-1), we purified full-length prosaposin and found that it also stimulated GPR37 and GPR37L1 signaling. Moreover, both prosaptide and prosaposin were found to protect primary astrocytes against oxidative stress, with these protective effects being attenuated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous astrocytic GPR37 or GPR37L1. These data reveal that GPR37 and GPR37L1 are receptors for the neuroprotective and glioprotective factors prosaptide and prosaposin.",,
16757564,"GPR56, an atypical G protein-coupled receptor, binds tissue transglutaminase, TG2, and inhibits melanoma tumor growth and metastasis.","The survival and growth of tumor cells in a foreign environment is considered a rate-limiting step during metastasis. To identify genes that may be essential for this process, we isolated highly metastatic variants from a poorly metastatic human melanoma cell line and performed expression analyses of metastases and primary tumors from these cells. GPR56 is among the genes markedly down-regulated in the metastatic variants. We show that overexpression of GPR56 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis, whereas reduced expression of GPR56 enhances tumor progression. Levels of GPR56 do not correlate with growth rate in vitro, suggesting that GPR56 may mediate growth suppression by interaction with a component in the tumor microenvironment in vivo. We show that GPR56 binds specifically to tissue transglutaminase, TG2, a widespread component of tissue and tumor stroma previously implicated as an inhibitor of tumor progression. We discuss the mechanisms whereby GPR56-TG2 interactions may suppress tumor growth and metastasis.",,
11091218,Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) downregulates its receptor (CD114) on neutrophils and induces gelatinase B release in humans.,"Despite the increasing use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for the mobilization of stem cells and neutrophils, its pharmacodynamic actions are not fully understood. Because of the roles of G-CSF and gelatinase B in leucokinetics, we set out to characterize the interaction of G-CSF with its receptor in humans and its effects on gelatinase B release. G-CSF was infused at bolus doses of 1 microg/kg and 5 microg/kg, and compared to placebo and dexamethasone (1 mg/kg b.i.d), which enhances the plasma levels of endogenous G-CSF. The study was randomized, double-blind, four-way crossover, in eight healthy male volunteers. G-CSF dose-independently induced profound neutropenia (> 95%) within minutes and downregulated its own receptor (CD114) on neutrophils by 75%. The G-CSF/CD114 interaction dose-independently induced degranulation of neutrophils as evidenced by a 300-400% increase in CD11b expression. Degranulation induced up to a 10-fold increase in plasma levels of gelatinase B, an enzyme known to precipitate neutropenia and subsequent neutrophilia in animals. In this study, it was shown that G-CSF downmodulates CD114 expression on the surface of neutrophils in humans and the consequent degranulation enhances gelatinase B release into plasma, which may contribute to mobilization of neutrophils or stem cells.",,
20660291,Gremlin is a novel agonist of the major proangiogenic receptor VEGFR2.,"The bone morphogenic protein antagonist gremlin is expressed during embryonic development and under different pathologic conditions, including cancer. Gremlin is a proangiogenic protein belonging to the cystine-knot superfamily that includes transforming growth factor-β proteins and the angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). Here, we demonstrate that gremlin binds VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2), the main transducer of VEGF-mediated angiogenic signals, in a bone morphogenic protein-independent manner. Similar to VEGF-A, gremlin activates VEGFR2 in endothelial cells, leading to VEGFR2-dependent angiogenic responses in vitro and in vivo. Gremlin thus represents a novel proangiogenic VEGFR2 agonist distinct from the VEGF family ligands with implications in vascular development, angiogenesis-dependent diseases, and tumor neovascularization.",,
27894090,"Gremlin promotes retinal pigmentation epithelial (RPE) cell proliferation, migration and VEGF production via activating VEGFR2-Akt-mTORC2 signaling.","Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is characterized by late-phase pathologic retinal vasoproliferation. Gremlin is a novel vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) receptor 2 (VEGFR2) agonist and promotes angiogenic response. We demonstrated that gremlin expression was significantly increased in retinas of ROP model mice, which was correlated with VEGF upregulation. In retinal pigmentation epithelial (RPE) cells, gremlin activated VEGFR2-Akt-mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2) signaling, and promoted cell proliferation, migration and VEGF production. VEGFR inhibition (by SU5416) or shRNA knockdown almost abolished gremlin-mediated pleiotropic functions in RPE cells. Further, pharmacological inhibition of Akt-mTOR, or shRNA knockdown of key mTORC2 component (Rictor or Sin1) also attenuated gremlin-exerted activities in RPE cells. We conclude that gremlin promotes RPE cell proliferation, migration and VEGF production possibly via activating VEGFR2-Akt-mTORC2 signaling. Gremlin could be a novel therapeutic target of ROP or other retinal vasoproliferation diseases.",Oncotarget,2017
25810250,Gremlin regulates renal inflammation via the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 pathway.,"Inflammation is a main feature of progressive kidney disease. Gremlin binds to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), acting as an antagonist and regulating nephrogenesis and fibrosis among other processes. Gremlin also binds to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in endothelial cells to induce angiogenesis. In renal cells, gremlin regulates proliferation and fibrosis, but there are no data about inflammatory-related events. We have investigated the direct effects of gremlin in the kidney, evaluating whether VEGFR2 is a functional gremlin receptor. Administration of recombinant gremlin to murine kidneys induced rapid and sustained activation of VEGFR2 signalling, located in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Gremlin bound to VEGFR2 in these cells in vitro, activating this signalling pathway independently of its action as an antagonist of BMPs. In vivo, gremlin caused early renal damage, characterized by activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway linked to up-regulation of pro-inflammatory factors and infiltration of immune inflammatory cells. VEGFR2 blockade diminished gremlin-induced renal inflammatory responses. The link between gremlin/VEGFR2 and NF-κB/inflammation was confirmed in vitro. Gremlin overexpression was associated with VEGFR2 activation in human renal disease and in the unilateral ureteral obstruction experimental model, where VEGFR2 kinase inhibition diminished renal inflammation. Our data show that a gremlin/VEGFR2 axis participates in renal inflammation and could be a novel target for kidney disease.",,
16845371,Growth differentiation factor 11 signals through the transforming growth factor-beta receptor ALK5 to regionalize the anterior-posterior axis.,"Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) contributes to regionalize the mouse embryo along its anterior-posterior axis by regulating the expression of Hox genes. The identity of the receptors that mediate GDF11 signalling during embryogenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that GDF11 can interact with type I receptors ALK4, ALK5 and ALK7, but predominantly uses ALK4 and ALK5 to activate a Smad3-dependent reporter gene. Alk5 mutant embryos showed malformations in anterior-posterior patterning, including the lack of expression of the posterior determinant Hoxc10, that resemble defects found in Gdf11-null mutants. A heterozygous mutation in Alk5, but not in Alk4 or Alk7, potentiated Gdf11(-/-)-like phenotypes in vertebral, kidney and palate development in an Acvr2b(-/-) background, indicating a genetic interaction between the two receptor genes. Thus, the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor ALK5, which until now has only been associated with the biological functions of TGF-beta1 to TGF-beta3 proteins, mediates GDF11 signalling during embryogenesis.",,
14684852,"Growth differentiation factor-9 signaling is mediated by the type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase 5.","Growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) is an oocyte-derived growth factor and a member of the TGF-beta superfamily that includes TGF-beta, activin, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). GDF-9 is indispensable for the development of ovarian follicles from the primary stage, and treatment with GDF-9 enhances the progression of early follicles into small preantral follicles. Similar to other TGF-beta family ligands, GDF-9 likely initiates signaling mediated by type I and type II receptors with serine/threonine kinase activity, followed by the phosphorylation of intracellular transcription factors named Smads. We have shown previously that GDF-9 interacts with the BMP type II receptor (BMPRII) in granulosa cells, but the type I receptor involved is unknown. Using P19 cells, we now report that GDF-9 treatment stimulated the CAGA-luciferase reporter known to be responsive to TGF-beta mediated by the type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)5. In contrast, GDF-9 did not stimulate BMP-responsive reporters. In addition, treatment with GDF-9 induced the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in P19 cells, and the stimulatory effect of GDF-9 on the CAGA-luciferase reporter was blocked by the inhibitory Smad7, but not Smad6. We further reconstructed the GDF-9 signaling pathway using Cos7 cells that are not responsive to GDF-9. After overexpression of ALK5, with or without exogenous Smad3, the Cos7 cells gained GDF-9 responsiveness based on the CAGA-luciferase reporter assay. The roles of ALK5 and downstream pathway genes in mediating GDF-9 actions were further tested in ovarian cells. In cultured rat granulosa cells from early antral follicles, treatment with GDF-9 stimulated the CAGA-luciferase reporter activity and induced the phosphorylation of Smad3. Furthermore, transfection with small interfering RNA for ALK5 or overexpression of the inhibitory Smad7 resulted in dose-dependent suppression of GDF-9 actions. In conclusion, although GDF-9 binds to the BMP-activated type II receptor, its downstream actions are mediated by the type I receptor, ALK5, and the Smad2 and Smad3 proteins. Because ALK5 is a known receptor for TGF-beta, diverse members of the TGF-beta family of ligands appear to interact with a limited number of receptors in a combinatorial manner to activate two downstream Smad pathways.",,
9281335,Growth-promoting interaction of IGF-II with the insulin receptor during mouse embryonic development.,"Genetic analyses of dwarfing phenotypes resulting from targeted mutagenesis of the genes encoding the insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) and their cognate type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) have demonstrated that this signaling system is a major determinant of mouse embryonic growth. Of the two IGF ligands, IGF-I interacts exclusively with IGF1R, whereas IGF-II recognizes an additional receptor (XR), because the growth retardation of embryos lacking both IGR1R and IGF-II (30% of normal birthweight) is more severe than that manifested in either class of single Igf1r or Igf2 null mutants (45 and 60% of normal, respectively). To determine whether XR is the insulin receptor (IR), we examined embryos nullizygous for both Igf1r and Insr. While the growth of embryos lacking solely IR is affected very mildly and only at the end of gestation, concomitant absence of IGF1R results in a severe growth-deficiency phenotype (30% of normal size at birth) that is first detected at Embryonic Day 13.5 and is also characterized by transient edema, curly tail, generalized organ hypoplasia, including the muscles, developmental delays in ossification, and thin epidermis. The Igf1r/Insr double nullizygotes are phenotypically indistinguishable from double mutants lacking IGF1R and IGF-II and from other double and triple mutants in which all of the IGF ligand/receptor interactions have been eliminated. Therefore, these results provide genetic evidence that the growth-promoting function of IGF-II during mouse embryogenesis is mediated in part by signaling through the insulin receptor.",,
11889121,"Guanylin, uroguanylin, and heat-stable euterotoxin activate guanylate cyclase C and/or a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein in human proximal tubule cells.","Membrane guanylate cyclase C (GC-C) is the receptor for guanylin, uroguanylin, and heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) in the intestine. GC-C-deficient mice show resistance to STa in intestine but saluretic and diuretic effects of uroguanylin and STa are not disturbed. Here we describe the cellular effects of these peptides using immortalized human kidney epithelial (IHKE-1) cells with properties of the proximal tubule, analyzed with the slow-whole-cell patch clamp technique. Uroguanylin (10 or 100 nm) either hyperpolarized or depolarized membrane voltages (V(m)). Guanylin and STa (both 10 or 100 nm), as well as 8-Br-cGMP (100 microm), depolarized V(m). All peptide effects were absent in the presence of 1 mm Ba(2+). Uroguanylin and guanylin changed V(m) pH dependently. Pertussis toxin (1 microg/ml, 24 h) inhibited hyperpolarizations caused by uroguanylin. Depolarizations caused by guanylin and uroguanylin were blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (10 microm). All three peptides increased cellular cGMP. mRNA for GC-C was detected in IHKE-1 cells and in isolated human proximal tubules. In IHKE-1 cells GC-C was also detected by immunostaining. These findings suggest that GC-C is probably the receptor for guanylin and STa. For uroguanylin two distinct signaling pathways exist in IHKE-1 cells, one involves GC-C and cGMP as second messenger, the other is cGMP-independent and connected to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein.",,
12506116,H3 relaxin is a specific ligand for LGR7 and activates the receptor by interacting with both the ectodomain and the exoloop 2.,"Leucine-rich repeat-containing, G protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) represent a unique subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors with a large ectodomain. Recent studies demonstrated that relaxin activates two orphan LGRs, LGR7 and LGR8, whereas INSL3/Leydig insulin-like peptide specifically activates LGR8. Human relaxin 3 (H3 relaxin) was recently discovered as a novel ligand for relaxin receptors. Here, we demonstrate that H3 relaxin activates LGR7 but not LGR8. Taking advantage of the overlapping specificity of these three ligands for the two related LGRs, chimeric receptors were generated to elucidate the mechanism of ligand activation of LGR7. Chimeric receptor LGR7/8 with the ectodomain from LGR7 but the transmembrane region from LGR8 maintains responsiveness to relaxin but was less responsive to H3 relaxin based on ligand stimulation of cAMP production. The decreased ligand signaling was accompanied by decreases in the ability of H3 relaxin to compete for (33)P-relaxin binding to the chimeric receptor. However, replacement of the exoloop 2, but not exoloop 1 or 3, of LGR7 to the chimeric LGR7/8 restored ligand binding and receptor-mediated cAMP production. These results suggested that activation of LGR7 by H3 relaxin involves specific binding of the ligand to both the ectodomain and the exoloop 2, thus providing a model with which to understand the molecular basis of ligand signaling for this unique subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
11448771,Head inducer Dickkopf-1 is a ligand for Wnt coreceptor LRP6.,"Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) is a head inducer secreted from the vertebrate head organizer and induces anterior development by antagonizing Wnt signaling. Although several families of secreted antagonists have been shown to inhibit Wnt signal transduction by binding to Wnt, the molecular mechanism of Dkk-1 action is unknown. The Wnt family of secreted growth factors initiates signaling via the Frizzled (Fz) receptor and its candidate coreceptor, LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), presumably through Fz-LRP6 complex formation induced by Wnt. The significance of the Fz-LRP6 complex in signal transduction remains to be established.",,
9048906,Heat-stable antigen (mouse CD24) in the brain: dual but distinct interaction with P-selectin and L1.,Heat-stable antigen (HSA/mouse CD24) is expressed in both haematopoietic and neural cells. The small core protein of the molecule is extensively glycosylated and anchored to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol. The role of HSA in the developing brain as well as its functional properties are poorly understood. Here we show that the brain HSA is associated with N- and O-linked oligosaccharide moieties and decorated with the HNK-1 sulfated carbohydrate epitope. It can bind P-selectin but not E-selectin and this interaction requires divalent cations and is sensitive to high salt. Brain derived HSA is also capable of binding to the L1 adhesion molecule. This interaction is distinct from the P-selectin binding as it is resistant to high salt and does not require bivalent cations. Treatment of HSA with OSGE significantly reduced binding of both P-selectin and I.1. Our data suggest that HSA can bind P-selectin and I.1 by distinct mechanism and that the binding epitopes on HSA are in close proximity.,Biochimica et biophysica acta,1997
17848687,Hedgehog signaling: cooking with Gas1.,"The mechanisms by which morphogens, such as Sonic hedgehog (Shh), specify distinct cell fates in a concentration-dependent manner are not fully understood. Shh signaling is regulated by a feedback network that comprises Shh-binding factors, the expression of which is controlled by the Hedgehog pathway itself. Recent studies have identified the hedgehog-binding protein growth arrest-specific gene 1 (Gas1) as a component of this network. Gas1 binds Shh to promote signaling, but its expression is subsequently inhibited by pathway activity. Gas1(-/-) mice display Shh dosage-dependent phenotypes in the neural tube, midface, and digits. Ectopic expression and in vitro assays indicate that Gas1 binds Shh synergistically with the Hedgehog receptor Patched1 and promotes signaling in a cell-autonomous fashion. Furthermore, Gas1 cooperates with another component of the feedback network, Cdo, in patterning the neural tube and midface. The coordinate regulation of the activity and expression of several different positively and negatively acting Shh binding proteins should result in fine-tuned modulation of graded Shh signaling.",,
2645577,Hematopoietic activity of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor is dependent upon two distinct regions of the molecule: functional analysis based upon the activities of interspecies hybrid growth factors.,"Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an acidic glycoprotein that stimulates hematopoiesis in vitro and in vivo. Despite a high degree of sequence homology, the GM-CSFs from human and murine sources fail to crossreact in their respective colony-forming assays. On the basis of this finding, a series of hybrid molecules containing various proportions of human- and murine-specific amino acid sequences were generated by recombinant DNA techniques and assayed for species-specific activity against human and murine marrow target cells. Two regions of GM-CSF, residues 38-48 and residues 95-111, were found to be critical for hematopoietic function. These regions are structurally characterized by an amphiphilic helix and by a disulfide-bonded loop, respectively, and are homologous in position in the human and murine growth factors. In addition, competition assays suggested that, together, these regions bind to the GM-CSF receptor.",,
11062498,Hemokinin is a hematopoietic-specific tachykinin that regulates B lymphopoiesis.,"We report here the molecular cloning of a newly identified preprotachykinin gene, Pptc, which specifies the sequence for a new preprotachykinin protein and bioactive peptide designated hemokinin 1 (HK-1). PPT-C mRNA was detected primarily in hematopoietic cells in contrast to the previously described Ppta and Pptb genes, which are predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues. HK-1 has several biological activities that are similar to the most studied tachykinin, substance P, such as induction of plasma extravasation and mast cell degranulation. However, HK-1 also has properties that are indicative of a critical role in mouse B cell development. HK-1 stimulated the proliferation of interleukin 7-expanded B cell precursors, whereas substance P had no effect. HK-1, but not substance P, promoted the survival of freshly isolated bone marrow B lineage cells or cultured, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated pre-B cells. N-acetyl-L-trytophan-3,5-bistrifluromethyl benzyl ester, a tachykinin receptor antagonist, increased apoptosis of these cells and in vivo administration of this antagonist led to specific reductions of the B220lowCD43 population (the pre-B cell compartment) in the bone marrow and the IgMhighIgDlow population (the newly generated B cells) in the spleen. Thus, HK-1 may be an autocrine factor that is important for the survival of B cell precursors at a critical phase of development.",,
15224188,Hemokinins and endokinins.,"The mammalian tachykinins are a family of peptides that, until recently, has included substance P (SP), neurokinin A and neurokinin B. Since, the discovery of a third preprotachykinin gene ( TAC4), the number of tachykinins has more than doubled to reveal several species-divergent peptides. This group includes hemokinin-1 (HK-1) in mouse and rat, endokinin-1 (EK-1) in rabbit, and EKA, EKB, human HK-1 (hHK-1) and hHK(4-11) in humans. Each exhibits a remarkable selectivity and potency for the tachykinin NK(1) receptor similar to SP. Their peripheral expression has led to the proposal that they are the endogenous peripheral SP-like endocrine/paracrine agonists where SP is not expressed. Moreover, their strong cross-reactivity with a specific SP antibody leads us to question many of the proposed locations and roles of SP in the periphery. Additionally, three orphan tachykinin gene-related peptides are identified on TAC4, in rabbit, EK-2 and in humans, EKC and EKD.",,
15846369,Heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding promotes APRIL-induced tumor cell proliferation.,"APRIL, a proliferation-inducing ligand, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family that is expressed by various types of tumors and influences their growth in vitro and in vivo. Two receptors, transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), bind APRIL, but neither is essential for the tumor-promoting effects, suggesting that a third receptor exists. Here, we report that APRIL specifically binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the surface of tumor cells. This binding is mediated by the heparin sulfate side chains and can be inhibited by heparin. Importantly, BCMA and HSPG do not compete, but can bind APRIL simultaneously, suggesting that different regions in APRIL are critical for either interaction. In agreement, mutation of three lysines in a putative heparin sulfate-binding motif, which is not part of the TNF fold, destroys interaction with HSPG, while binding to BCMA is unaffected. Finally, whereas interaction of APRIL with HSPG does not influence APRIL-induced proliferation of T cells, it is crucial for its tumor growth-promoting activities. We therefore conclude that either HSPG serve as a receptor for APRIL or that HSPG binding allows APRIL to interact with a receptor that promotes tumor growth.",Cell death and differentiation,2005
11865065,Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are ligands for receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma.,"RPTPsigma is a cell adhesion molecule-like receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in nervous system development. Its avian orthologue, known as cPTPsigma or CRYPalpha, promotes intraretinal axon growth and controls the morphology of growth cones. The molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of cPTPsigma are still to be determined, since neither its physiological ligand(s) nor its substrates have been described. Nevertheless, a major class of ligand(s) is present in the retinal basal lamina and glial endfeet, the potent native growth substrate for retinal axons. We demonstrate here that cPTPsigma is a heparin-binding protein and that its basal lamina ligands include the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) agrin and collagen XVIII. These molecules interact with high affinity with cPTPsigma in vitro, and this binding is totally dependent upon their heparan sulfate chains. Using molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis, a binding site for heparin and heparan sulfate was identified in the first immunoglobulin-like domain of cPTPsigma. HSPGs are therefore a novel class of heterotypic ligand for cPTPsigma, suggesting that cPTPsigma signaling in axons and growth cones is directly responsive to matrix-associated cues.",Molecular and cellular biology,2002
10037743,Heparan sulfate-modified CD44 promotes hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor-induced signal transduction through the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met.,"CD44 has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, but the mechanism(s) involved is as yet poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that CD44 isoforms containing the alternatively spliced exon v3 carry heparan sulfate side chains and are able to bind heparin-binding growth factors. In the present study, we have explored the possibility of a physical and functional interaction between CD44 and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), the ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met. The HGF/SF-c-Met pathway mediates cell growth and motility and has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. We demonstrate that a CD44v3 splice variant efficiently binds HGF/SF via its heparan sulfate side chain. To address the functional relevance of this interaction, Namalwa Burkitt's lymphoma cells were stably co-transfected with c-Met and either CD44v3 or the isoform CD44s, which lacks heparan sulfate. We show that, as compared with CD44s, CD44v3 promotes: (i) HGF/SF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met, (ii) phosphorylation of several downstream proteins, and (iii) activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and -2. By heparitinase treatment and the use of a mutant HGF/SF with greatly decreased affinity for heparan sulfate, we show that the enhancement of c-Met signal transduction induced by CD44v3 was critically dependent on heparan sulfate moieties. Our results identify heparan sulfate-modified CD44 (CD44-HS) as a functional co-receptor for HGF/SF which promotes signaling through the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met, presumably by concentrating and presenting HGF/SF. As both CD44-HS and c-Met are overexpressed on several types of tumors, we propose that the observed functional collaboration might be instrumental in promoting tumor growth and metastasis.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
16982797,Heparanase deglycanation of syndecan-1 is required for binding of the epithelial-restricted prosecretory mitogen lacritin.,"Cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are carbohydrate-rich regulators of cell migratory, mitogenic, secretory, and inflammatory activity that bind and present soluble heparin-binding growth factors (e.g., fibroblast growth factor, Wnt, Hh, transforming growth factor beta, amphiregulin, and hepatocyte growth factor) to their respective signaling receptors. We demonstrate that the deglycanated core protein of syndecan-1 (SDC1) and not HS chains nor SDC2 or -4, appears to target the epithelial selective prosecretory mitogen lacritin. An important and novel step in this mechanism is that binding necessitates prior partial or complete removal of HS chains by endogenous heparanase. This limits lacritin activity to sites where heparanase appears to predominate, such as sites of exocrine cell migration, secretion, renewal, and inflammation. Binding is mutually specified by lacritin's C-terminal mitogenic domain and SDC1's N terminus. Heparanase modification of the latter transforms a widely expressed HS proteoglycan into a highly selective surface-binding protein. This novel example of cell specification through extracellular modification of an HS proteoglycan has broad implications in development, homeostasis, and disease.",,
8194524,"Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, which acts as the diphtheria toxin receptor, forms a complex with membrane protein DRAP27/CD9, which up-regulates functional receptors and diphtheria toxin sensitivity.","DRAP27, the monkey homolog of human CD9 antigen (DRAP27/CD9) and diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) were expressed in mouse L cells. L cells transfected transiently with both DRAP27/CD9 and DTR cDNA bound approximately 10 times more diphtheria toxin (DT) than cells transfected with DTR alone. Stable L cell transfectants expressing both DTR and DRAP27/CD9 (LCH-1 cells) had 15 times more cell surface DT-binding sites and were 20 times more sensitive to DT than were stable L cell transfectants expressing DTR alone (LH-1 cells). Increased DT-binding and DT sensitivity were not due to increased DTR transcription or increased cell surface DTR protein. Co-immunoprecipitation of DRAP27/CD9 with DTR and chemical cross-linking suggest a tight association of these membrane-bound proteins. In addition, the identity of DTR and a growth factor (HB-EGF) was established. Immobilized DT specifically adsorbed HB-EGF precursor solubilized from transfected L cells and [125I]DT bound to immobilized recombinant HB-EGF. We conclude that DRAP27/CD9 associates tightly with DTR/HB-EGF and up-regulates the number of functional DTRs and DT sensitivity, and that HB-EGF is identical to DTR.",,
24768768,Hepassocin activates the EGFR/ERK cascade and induces proliferation of L02 cells through the Src-dependent pathway.,"Hepassocin (HPS) is a secreted protein with mitogenic activity on primary hepatocytes and protects hepatocytes from chemically-induced injury. Our previous studies showed that HPS stimulates proliferation of hepatocytes in an ERK pathway-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanism of HPS-induced activation of the ERK pathway remains unclear. In this study, we found that HPS induced the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the human L02 hepatocyte cell line, and this event was concomitant with the activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src. Specific inhibition of EGFR kinase activity by gefitinib or down-regulation of EGFR by specific EGFR siRNAs prevented HPS-induced activation of the ERK pathway and proliferation of L02 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Src activity significantly blocked HPS-induced activation of the EGFR, which was suggestive of a ligand-independent transactivation mechanism of EGFR itself as well as ERK phosphorylation and proliferation of L02 cells. These results indicate that EGFR plays an important role in the mitogenic signaling induced by HPS in L02 cell lines and may further stimulate research on the role of HPS in hepatocytes within biological processes in human health and disease.",,

Here we report functional evidence for receptor heteromerization for efficient signal transduction, and we define minimal requirements in the two receptor subunits for IL-9R function. Tyrosine 336 of the IL-9Ralpha and the membrane-proximal segment of gammac are both crucial for signaling. The activated IL-9R complex employs the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3 for subsequent activation of the signal transducer and activator transcription (STAT) factors STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5. This process is independent of Tyk2. We demonstrate further that the activated STAT complexes consist of STAT-1 and STAT-5 homodimers and STAT-1-STAT-3 heterodimers. Finally, we show that IL-9R signaling in a T cell line does not result in detectable mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and leads to unsustained proliferation. Nonetheless, these T cells are efficiently protected from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. These results further define the molecular architecture of the IL-9R and its specific connections to various biologic responses.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
16091383,Heterotypic interaction of CRTAM with Necl2 induces cell adhesion on activated NK cells and CD8+ T cells.,"NK cells and CD8+ T cells exhibit cytotoxicity and cytokine production upon recognizing target cells through cell-cell interaction. We screened the molecules involved in the recognition and regulation of these cells using cDNA subtraction between naive and activated NK cells. We identified class I-restricted T cell-associated molecule (CRTAM), a two Ig domain-bearing surface receptor, as a molecule rapidly and transiently expressed on NK cells and CD8+ T cells upon activation. CRTAM is expressed as a dimer on the cell surface, and its expression is transcriptionally regulated. Using an expression-cloning system, we then further identified Nectin-like (Necl) molecule 2, a three Ig domain-containing receptor, as a ligand of CRTAM. While Necl2 mediates homotypic interaction, CRTAM interacts with Necl2 but not with CRTAM itself. The heterotypic CRTAM-Necl2 interaction has a higher affinity than the homotypic Necl2 interaction. Although there was no clear alteration in the cytotoxic function of the NK cells and CD8+ T cells against the Necl2-expressing target cells, T cells expressing CRTAM tightly bound to Necl2-expressing cells. CRTAM+ cells did not induce homotypic aggregation but they did exert strong heterotypic binding with Necl2+ cells, which was inhibited by the addition of the CRTAM-Ig fusion protein. These results suggest that the heterotypic interaction between CRTAM and Necl2 plays an important role in the adhesion, interaction or migration of NK cells and CD8+ T cells upon stimulation.",,
12829785,Hexameric structure and assembly of the interleukin-6/IL-6 alpha-receptor/gp130 complex.,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that activates a cell-surface signaling assembly composed of IL-6, the IL-6 alpha-receptor (IL-6Ralpha), and the shared signaling receptor gp130. The 3.65 angstrom-resolution structure of the extracellular signaling complex reveals a hexameric, interlocking assembly mediated by a total of 10 symmetry-related, thermodynamically coupled interfaces. Assembly of the hexameric complex occurs sequentially: IL-6 is first engaged by IL-6Ralpha and then presented to gp130in the proper geometry to facilitate a cooperative transition into the high-affinity, signaling-competent hexamer. The quaternary structures of other IL-6/IL-12 family signaling complexes are likely constructed by means of a similar topological blueprint.",,

10419462,HHV8-encoded vMIP-I selectively engages chemokine receptor CCR8. Agonist and antagonist profiles of viral chemokines.,"Uncertainty regarding viral chemokine function is mirrored by an incomplete knowledge of host chemokine receptor usage by the virally encoded proteins. One such molecule is vMIP-I, a C-C type chemokine of undefined function and binding specificity, encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus HHV-8. We report here that vMIP-I binds to and induces cytosolic [Ca(2+)] signals in human T cells selectively through CCR8, a CC chemokine receptor associated with Th2 lymphocytes. Furthermore, using a panel of 65 different human, viral, and rodent chemokines, we have established a comprehensive ligand binding ""fingerprint"" for CCR8. The receptor exhibits marked ""high"" affinity (K(d) < 15 nM) only for four chemokines, three of them of viral origin: vMIP-I, vMIP-II, vMCC-I, and human I-309. A previously unreported second class of lower affinity ligands includes MCP-3 and possibly two other viral chemokines. vMIP-I and I-309 appear to act as CCR8 agonists: binding to and inducing cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation through the receptor. By contrast, vMIP-II and vMCC-I act as potent antagonists: binding without inducing signaling, and blocking the effects of I-309 and vMIP-I. These results suggest a ligand hierarchy for CCR8, identifying vMIP-I as a selective viral chemokine agonist. CCR8 may thus engage a specific subset of chemokines with the potential to regulate each other during viral infection and immune regulation.",,
22262843,High affinity neurexin binding to cell adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor CIRL1/latrophilin-1 produces an intercellular adhesion complex.,"The G-protein-coupled receptor CIRL1/latrophilin-1 (CL1) and the type-1 membrane proteins neurexins represent distinct neuronal cell adhesion molecules that exhibit no similarities except for one common function: both proteins are receptors for α-latrotoxin, a component of black widow spider venom that induces massive neurotransmitter release at synapses. Unexpectedly, we have now identified a direct binding interaction between the extracellular domains of CL1 and neurexins that is regulated by alternative splicing of neurexins at splice site 4 (SS4). Using saturation binding assays, we showed that neurexins lacking an insert at SS4 bind to CL1 with nanomolar affinity, whereas neurexins containing an insert at SS4 are unable to bind. CL1 competed for neurexin binding with neuroligin-1, a well characterized neurexin ligand. The extracellular sequences of CL1 contain five domains (lectin, olfactomedin-like, serine/threonine-rich, hormone-binding, and G-protein-coupled receptor autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domains). Of these domains, the olfactomedin-like domain mediates neurexin binding as shown by deletion mapping. Cell adhesion assays using cells expressing neurexins and CL1 revealed that their interaction produces a stable intercellular adhesion complex, indicating that their interaction can be trans-cellular. Thus, our data suggest that CL1 constitutes a novel ligand for neurexins that may be localized postsynaptically based on its well characterized interaction with intracellular SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeats adaptor proteins (SHANK) and could form a trans-synaptic complex with presynaptic neurexins.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2012
12907757,High constitutive signaling of the ghrelin receptor--identification of a potent inverse agonist.,"Ghrelin is a GH-releasing peptide that also has an important role as an orexigenic hormone-stimulating food intake. By measuring inositol phosphate turnover or by using a reporter assay for transcriptional activity controlled by cAMP-responsive elements, the ghrelin receptor showed strong, ligand-independent signaling in transfected COS-7 or human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Ghrelin and a number of the known nonpeptide GH secretagogues acted as agonists stimulating inositol phosphate turnover further. In contrast, the low potency ghrelin antagonist, [D-Arg1,D-Phe5,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]-substance P was surprisingly found to be a high potency (EC50 = 5.2 nm) full inverse agonist as it decreased the constitutive signaling of the ghrelin receptor down to that observed in untransfected cells. The homologous motilin receptor functioned as a negative control as it did not display any sign of constitutive activity; however, upon agonist stimulation the motilin receptor signaled as strongly as the unstimulated ghrelin receptor. It is concluded that the ghrelin receptor is highly constitutively active and that this activity could be of physiological importance in its role as a regulator of both GH secretion and appetite control. It is suggested that inverse agonists for the ghrelin receptor could be particularly interesting for the treatment of obesity.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",2003
9276730,"High expression of the chemokine receptor CCR3 in human blood basophils. Role in activation by eotaxin, MCP-4, and other chemokines.","Eosinophil leukocytes express high numbers of the chemokine receptor CCR3 which binds eotaxin, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-4, and some other CC chemokines. In this paper we show that CCR3 is also highly expressed on human blood basophils, as indicated by Northern blotting and flow cytometry, and mediates mainly chemotaxis. Eotaxin and MCP-4 elicited basophil migration in vitro with similar efficacy as regulated upon activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) and MCP-3. They also induced the release of histamine and leukotrienes in IL-3-primed basophils, but their efficacy was lower than that of MCP-1 and MCP-3, which were the most potent stimuli of exocytosis. Pretreatment of the basophils with a CCR3-blocking antibody abrogated the migration induced by eotaxin, RANTES, and by low to optimal concentrations of MCP-4, but decreased only minimally the response to MCP-3. The CCR3-blocking antibody also affected exocytosis: it abrogated histamine and leukotriene release induced by eotaxin, and partially inhibited the response to RANTES and MCP-4. In contrast, the antibody did not affect the responses induced by MCP-1, MCP-3, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, which may depend on CCR1 and CCR2, two additional receptors detected by Northern blotting with basophil RNA. This study demonstrates that CCR3 is the major receptor for eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-4 in human basophils, and suggests that basophils and eosinophils, which are the characteristic effector cells of allergic inflammation, depend largely on CCR3 for migration towards different chemokines into inflamed tissues.",,
15207250,"High level expression, activation, and antagonism of CC chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells.","The specificity of leukocyte trafficking in inflammation is controlled by the interactions of chemokines with chemokine receptors. Reliable structure-function studies of chemokine-receptor interactions would benefit from cell lines that express consistent high levels of chemokine receptors. We describe herein two new Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines in which the genes for chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR3 have been incorporated into identical positions in the host genome. CCR2 is the primary receptor for the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) whereas CCR3 is the primary receptor for the chemokines eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3. Both receptors are expressed at >5,000,000 copies per cell, substantially higher levels than in previous cell lines, and both are competent for binding and activation by the cognate chemokines for these receptors. Using these cell lines we confirm that eotaxin-1 and eotaxin-3 can act as an agonist and an antagonist, respectively, of CCR2. In addition, we show that eotaxin-2 is an antagonist of CCR2 and MCP-1 is an agonist of CCR3. Comparison of the chemokine sequences reveals several positions that are identical in MCP-1 and eotaxin-1 but different in eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3, suggesting that these amino acids play a role in CCR2 activation.",,
9488719,High resolution mapping of the binding site of TrkA for nerve growth factor and TrkC for neurotrophin-3 on the second immunoglobulin-like domain of the Trk receptors.,"Neurotrophic factors are important for survival and maintenance of neurons during developmental and adult stages of the vertebrate nervous system. The neurotrophins mediate their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family. The extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain of the Trk receptors adjacent to the membrane has previously been shown to be the dominant element for specific neurotrophin binding. Using computer graphics models of the human TrkA and TrkC immunoglobulin-like domains as a guide, the residues involved in binding to their respective neurotrophins were mapped by mutational analysis. TrkC primarily utilizes loop EF, between beta-strands E and F, for binding. In contrast, TrkA utilizes the EF loop as well as additional residues, the latter being prime candidates for determining the specificity of TrkA versus TrkC. When selected TrkC and TrkA mutants with reduced binding were expressed on NIH3T3 cells, neurotrophin-induced autophosphorylation was strongly reduced or absent.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
11403934,High specificity of human orexin receptors for orexins over neuropeptide Y and other neuropeptides.,"Orexin- and neuropeptide Y-ergic systems show physiological interaction in the regulation of appetite. In this study we investigate the postulated effect of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and other peptides directly on orexin OX1 and OX2 receptors. None of the tested peptides (NPY-variants, secretin, alpha-melanocortin, pancreatic polypeptide or pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide-38) induced any Ca2+ elevation at the concentrations up to 300 nM (human NPY, secretin and alpha-melanocortin up to 1 microM). Orexin-A- and -B-mediated Ca2+ elevations were completely unaffected by the peptides. In binding assays, human NPY, secretin and alpha-melanocortin at 1 microM did not induce any displacement of 0.1 nM [125I]orexin-A. Thus, in contrast to the previously reported result on orexin-A binding, our results demonstrate that NPY does not directly interact with orexin receptor in intact cellular settings.",Neuroscience letters,2001
11747427,High-resolution NMR structure of the chemically-synthesized melanocortin receptor binding domain AGRP(87-132) of the agouti-related protein.,"The agouti-related protein (AGRP) is an endogenous antagonist of the melanocortin receptors MC3R and MC4R found in the hypothalamus and exhibits potent orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) activity. The cysteine-rich C-terminal domain of this protein, corresponding to AGRP(87-132), contains five disulfide bonds and exhibits receptor binding affinity and antagonism equivalent to that of the full-length protein. The three-dimensional structure of this domain has been determined by 1H NMR at 800 MHz. The first 34 residues of AGRP(87-132) are well-ordered and contain a three-stranded antiparallel beta sheet, where the last two strands form a beta hairpin. The relative spatial positioning of the disulfide cross-links demonstrates that the ordered region of AGRP(87-132) adopts the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) fold previously identified for numerous invertebrate toxins. Interestingly, this may be the first example of a mammalian protein assigned to the ICK superfamily. The hairpin's turn region presents a triplet of residues (Arg-Phe-Phe) known to be essential for melanocortin receptor binding. The structure also suggests that AGRP possesses an additional melanocortin-receptor contact region within a loop formed by the first 16 residues of its C-terminal domain. This specific region shows little sequence homology to the corresponding region of the agouti protein, which is an MC1R antagonist involved in pigmentation. Consideration of these sequence differences, along with recent experiments on mutant and chimeric melanocortin receptors, allows us to postulate that this loop in the first 16 residues of its C-terminal domain confers AGRP's distinct selectivity for MC3R and MC4R.",Biochemistry,2001
11097863,Highly potent nociceptin analog containing the Arg-Lys triple repeat.,"One of the structural characteristics of a neuropeptide nociceptin is the existence of Arg-Lys (RK) residues at positions 8-9 and 12-13; both RKs have been suggested to bind to the acidic amino acid cluster in the second extracellular loop of the seven transmembrane domain receptor ORL1. With a design strategy of attempting to obtain an analog that binds more strongly to the receptor's acidic cluster, we synthesized a series of nociceptin analogs in which the RK dipeptide unit was placed at positions 6-7, 10-11, or 14-15 adjacent to the parent RKs. Among these nociceptin analogs containing the RK triple repeat, [Arg-Lys(6-7)]- and [Arg-Lys(10-11)]nociceptins exhibited weak activities (6-9 and 60-90% of nociceptin, respectively) both in the receptor binding assay and in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding functional assay. In contrast, [Arg-Lys(14-15)]nociceptin was found to be very potent in both assays (3-fold in binding and 17-fold in GTPgammaS functional assay). [Arg-Lys(14-15)]nociceptin was the first peptide analog found to be stronger than the parent nociceptin, and structure-activity studies have suggested that the incorporated Arg-Lys(14-15) interacts with either the receptor acidic amino acid cluster or the receptor aromatic amino acid residues.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2000
7921229,Histamine- and stress-induced prolactin secretion: importance of vasopressin V1- and V2-receptors.,"We investigated the involvement of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V1- and V2-receptors in the prolactin (PRL) secretory response to histamine (HA) or restraint stress stimulation in conscious male rats by selective blockade of AVP receptors using different antagonists. Histamine (270 nmol) administered intracerebroventricularly or 5 min of restraint stress stimulated PRL secretion 10-14-fold. Pretreatment with the selective V1-receptor antagonists [1-(p-t-butyl-beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid)-2-(O-methyl)tyrosine-8-D-arginine]vasopressin or [1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid)-2-(O-methyl)tyrosine-8-arginine]vassopressin inhibited the PRL response to HA and restraint stress in a dose-dependent manner with maximal inhibition of 60%. The effect of the two antagonists was identical when equipotent antivasopressor doses were administered. The selective V2-receptor antagonist [1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid)-2-D-isoleucine-4-isoleucine-8-arginine]vasopressin was unable to inhibit the PRL response significantly. Combined administration of the V1-receptor antagonist [1-(p-t-butyl-beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid-2-(O-methyl)tyrosine-8-D-arginine]vasopressin and the V2-receptor antagonist inhibited the PRL response to HA to the same extent as that observed when the V1-antagonist was administered alone. None of the antagonists used had any effect on basal PRL secretion. We conclude that AVP seems to play a role in the mediation of HA- and restraint stress-induced secretion of PRL, and that the AVP receptor involved is primarily of the V1-type or similar to this.",European journal of endocrinology,1994
8278375,Histidine-367 of the human common beta chain of the receptor is critical for high-affinity binding of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.,"High-affinity receptors for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 3, and interleukin 5 consist of ligand-specific alpha chains (low-affinity subunits) and a common beta chain (beta c) that converts each complex to a high-affinity form. Although beta c alone has no detectable cytokine-binding activity, amino acid substitutions for Glu-21 of human GM-CSF significantly reduce high-affinity but not low-affinity binding, implying that beta c interacts directly with GM-CSF during formation of the high-affinity receptor but only in the presence of the alpha chain. A potential GM-CSF-binding determinant was identified in the second hemopoietin domain of beta c, and the role of individual residues within this region was investigated by determining the ability of mutated beta c chains to confer high-affinity binding when coexpressed with the alpha subunit of the GM-CSF receptor in COS cells. Substitutions involving Met-363, Arg-364, Tyr-365, and Glu-366 did not affect high-affinity binding. However, substitution of His-367 by lysine or glutamine abolished high-affinity binding, suggesting that this residue may form an important part of the high-affinity GM-CSF-binding determinant. Consistent with the loss of high-affinity binding, higher concentrations of human GM-CSF were required to stimulate proliferation of CTLL-2 cell lines transfected with cDNAs for GM-CSF receptor alpha chain and His-367 beta c mutant than those expressing GM-CSF receptor alpha subunit and beta c wild type.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1994
7524669,Histidine-rich glycoprotein and platelet factor 4 mask heparan sulfate proteoglycans recognized by acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor.,"Recent studies have shown that fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) need to interact with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in order to bind to and activate FGF receptors. In this paper, three major heparin-binding proteins, histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) and antithrombin III (ATIII), which are constitutively present at high concentrations in plasma, and platelet factor 4 (PF4), which is released locally at high concentrations by degranulating platelets, were tested for their ability to act as modulators of FGF activity by competing with the FGFs for cell-surface HSPGs. HRGs from both chicken and human, and human PF4, were demonstrated to compete with each other and with acidic FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) for binding to BALB/c 3T3 cell-surface HSPGs, whereas ATIII did not compete. Thus, HRG, PF4, aFGF, and bFGF all interact with the same HS chains on the 3T3 cell surface, either binding to the same or binding to adjacent saccharide sequences on the chains. In terms of their relative binding affinity for cell-surface HSPGs, the hierarchy was shown to be PF4 > or = bFGF > aFGF = cHRG > hHRG. HRG was also shown to significantly inhibit both FGF-stimulated and endogenous 3T3 cell DNA synthesis. HRG also binds to extracellular matrices (ECM), originating from bovine corneal endothelial cells, in a heparin-inhibitable manner. Indeed, both HRG and PF4, at physiological concentrations, were shown to effectively inhibit the binding of 125I-aFGF and 125I-bFGF to ECM. In addition, HRG was able to displace biologically active bFGF from the ECM. On the basis of these findings, it is proposed that HRG and PF4 may act as positive regulators of FGF activity by displacing FGF from the ECM or basement membrane and making FGF available to responsive cells. Alternatively, they could act as negative regulators by masking HSPGs on responsive cells and preventing FGF receptor activation.",,
10421785,Histidine-rich glycoprotein regulates the binding of monomeric IgG and immune complexes to monocytes.,"Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is a relatively abundant plasma protein which we have shown previously inhibits the formation of insoluble immune complexes (IC). In this study we examined the ability of HRG to regulate the binding of monomeric IgG and IC to monocytes. Initial studies demonstrated that HRG interacts with FcgammaRI on the monocytic cell line THP1 and blocks the binding of monomeric IgG to these cells. However, despite totally blocking the binding of monomeric IgG to FcgammaRI, pre-incubation of THP1 cells with HRG had no effect on the binding of IC to these cells. In contrast, depending on the HRG:IgG molar ratio, pre-incubation of monomeric IgG with HRG resulted in either enhanced or reduced IgG binding to FcgammaRI. Similarly, under certain highly defined conditions, incorporation of HRG in IgG-containing IC potentiated the binding of IC to THP1 cells. The key conditions involved incorporating approximately equimolar concentrations of HRG and IgG in the IC, the IC being formed at a near equivalence antigen:antibody ratio and usually physiological concentration (20 microM) of Zn(2+) being present. Collectively these observations indicate that HRG is an important regulator of IC uptake by monocytes. Thus HRG can interact with FcgammaRI on monocytes and block monomeric IgG binding, whereas when incorporated in IgG containing IC, HRG can enhance the uptake of IC by monocytes, probably via its heparan sulfate binding domain.",International immunology,1999
21270408,HLA class I allelic sequence and conformation regulate leukocyte Ig-like receptor binding.,"Leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LILRs) are a family of innate immune receptors predominantly expressed by myeloid cells that can alter the Ag presentation properties of macrophages and dendritic cells. Several LILRs bind HLA class I. Altered LILR recognition due to HLA allelic variation could be a contributing factor in disease. We comprehensively assessed LILR binding to >90 HLA class I alleles. The inhibitory receptors LILRB1 and LILRB2 varied in their level of binding to different HLA alleles, correlating in some cases with specific amino acid motifs. LILRB2 displayed the weakest binding to HLA-B*2705, an allele genetically associated with several autoimmune conditions and delayed progression of HIV infection. We also assessed the effect of HLA class I conformation on LILR binding. LILRB1 exclusively bound folded β(2)-microglobulin-associated class I, whereas LILRB2 bound both folded and free H chain forms. In contrast, the activating receptor LILRA1 and the soluble LILRA3 protein displayed a preference for binding to HLA-C free H chain. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the ligand of LILRA3. These findings support the hypothesis that LILR-mediated detection of unfolded versus folded MHC modulates immune responses during infection or inflammation.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2011
9486650,"HLA-E binds to natural killer cell receptors CD94/NKG2A, B and C.","The protein HLA-E is a non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule of limited sequence variability. Its expression on the cell surface is regulated by the binding of peptides derived from the signal sequence of some other MHC class I molecules. Here we report the identification of ligands for HLA-E. We constructed tetramers in which recombinant HLA-E and beta2-microglobulin were refolded with an MHC leader-sequence peptide, biotinylated, and conjugated to phycoerythrin-labelled Extravidin. This HLA-E tetramer bound to natural killer (NK) cells and a small subset of T cells from peripheral blood. On transfectants, the tetramer bound to the CD94/NKG2A, CD94/NKGK2B and CD94/NKG2C NK cell receptors, but did not bind to the immunoglobulin family of NK cell receptors (KIR). Surface expression of HLA-E was enough to protect target cells from lysis by CD94/NKG2A+ NK-cell clones. A subset of HLA class I alleles has been shown to inhibit killing by CD94/NKG2A+ NK-cell clones. Only the HLA alleles that possess a leader peptide capable of upregulating HLA-E surface expression confer resistance to NK-cell-mediated lysis, implying that their action is mediated by HLA-E, the predominant ligand for the NK cell inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A.",,
9295021,HLA-G recognition by human natural killer cells. Involvement of CD94 both as inhibitory and as activating receptor complex.,"The lack of classical human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules in human placenta prevents the recognition and lysis by maternal T lymphocytes but poses the problem of susceptibility to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis. The nonclassical HLA class I molecule HLA-G may mediate protection from NK cells. NK cells are known to express a number of HLA class I-specific inhibitory receptors. These include members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily (p58, p70, p140), characterized by a defined allele specificity, and CD94/NKG2A with a broad specificity for different HLA class I molecules. We analyzed a series of NK cell clones derived from normal peripheral blood expressing different NK receptors (NKR). Clones were analyzed for their cytolytic activity against the HLA class I-negative 221 cell line either untransfected or transfected with HLA-G (221/G) or other informative alleles, as control. All clones expressing CD94/NKG2A [as identified by the Z199 monoclonal antibody (mAb)] displayed a markedly reduced cytolytic activity against 221/G. Moreover, mAb directed to the CD94/NKG2A complex completely restored target cell lysis. Among NKG2A-negative NK clones, different functional patterns could be detected. Clones expressing inhibitory receptors belonging to the Ig superfamily lysed 221/G target cells with equal or higher efficiency than untransfected 221 cells. These data indicated that p58, p70 and p140 do not function as HLA-G-specific inhibitory NKR, and that HLA-G-specific activating NKR also exist. Further analysis indicated that in these clones (characterized by the CD94+/NKG2A- phenotype) mAb specific for CD94, but not for the other NKR, reversed the activating effect. Infrequent clones were also isolated that, in spite of the lack of CD94/NKG2A, displayed HLA-G specificity, thus suggesting the existence of a different, still unknown NKR.",European journal of immunology,1997
15670976,"HLA-G up-regulates ILT2, ILT3, ILT4, and KIR2DL4 in antigen presenting cells, NK cells, and T cells.","The nonclassical HLA class I antigen HLA-G is an inhibitory molecule involved in immune tolerance and immune escape.

Cells expressing HLA-G and cells expressing its receptors are often found in the vicinity of each other, but the mechanisms responsible for this colocalization are still unknown. We report that ILT2, ILT3, ILT4, and KIR2DL4 expression is up-regulated by HLA-G in antigen-presenting cells, NK cells, and T cells. Because this up-regulation seems not to require antigenic costimulation, it might precede an immune response. Functionally, up-regulation of inhibitory receptors in immune cells before stimulation might increase their activation thresholds and participate in immune escape mechanisms.",,

10601865,Homologous desensitization of the human guanylate cyclase C receptor. Cell-specific regulation of catalytic activity.,"Guanylate Cyclase C (GCC) serves as a receptor for the endogenous ligands, guanylin and uroguanylin, as well as the family of bacterial heat-stable enterotoxins (ST), which are one of the major causes of diarrhoea the world over. We had earlier provided evidence that GCC, present in the human colonic T84 cell line, is desensitized on prolonged exposure to ST, and this desensitization was reflected in a reduced ST-stimulated guanylate cyclase activity of GCC [Bakre, M.M. & Visweswariah, S.S. (1997) FEBS Lett. 408, 345-349]. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms that underlie this cellular desensitization process. Desensitization of T84 cells was not a result of reduction in GCC present in membranes prepared from desensitized T84 cells, nor due to increased cGMP-phosphodiesterase activity associated with the membrane fraction. The decrease in ST-stimulatable guanylate cyclase activity of GCC was due to a dramatic reduction in the Vmax of the cyclase, which was also seen when MnGTP was used as the substrate. GCC undergoes ligand-induced inactivation in vitro, which is alleviated in the presence of ATP. In vivo desensitized GCC could be further inactivated in vitro when preincubated with ST, indicating that the two mechanisms of GCC inactivation are distinct. Cellular refractoriness as reflected by a reduced responsiveness to further ST-stimulation following prior exposure to IST, coupled with GCC desensitization was also observed in another colonic cell line, Caco2. However, HEK293 cells, stably transfected with GCC cDNA, when exposed to ST for prolonged periods, did not result in GCC desensitization, indicating that desensitization of GCC appeared to be a cell specific phenomenon. GCC expressed in HEK293-GCC cells, however, showed in vitro ligand induced inactivation, suggesting that there are two independent means of ligand-induced desensitization of GCC, perhaps distinct from the mechanisms that have been described earlier for other members of the guanylate cyclase receptor family.",,
9010926,Homology modeling study of the human interleukin-7 receptor complex.,"Following a recent model of human interleukin-7 (IL-7), we present here a modeling study of the extracellular part of the human IL-7 receptor complex, including the IL-7 specific (IL-7R) and the common gamma (gamma c) chains. The investigation is based on structural homology to the complex of human growth hormone (hGH) bound to its receptor (hGHR). For domain 1 of IL-7R two different models are presented which differ in the alignment to hGHR in three regions. However, these differences affect binding to IL-7 in only one region, at the interface between loop EF of domain 1 of IL-7R and helix C of IL-7. The disulfide pattern in domain 1 of IL-7R is predicted to deviate from that observed in hGHR in that the C'-E disulfide (hGHR) is replaced by a C-C' cross-link. The prediction for the gamma c chain is compared with two previous studies. The models of the complex provide insight into the binding of IL-7 to its receptor and have implications for the suggestion of mutagenesis experiments and the design of (ant)agonists.",Protein engineering,1996
8394372,"Homophilic binding of PTP mu, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase, can mediate cell-cell aggregation.","The receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPmu, displays structural similarity to cell-cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily. We have investigated the ability of human PTPmu to function in such a capacity. Expression of PTPmu, with or without the PTPase domains, by recombinant baculovirus infection of Sf9 cells induced their aggregation. However, neither a chimeric form of PTPmu, containing the extracellular and transmembrane segments of the EGF receptor and the intracellular segment of PTPmu, nor the intracellular segment of PTPmu expressed as a soluble protein induced aggregation. PTPmu mediates aggregation via a homophilic mechanism, as judged by lack of incorporation of uninfected Sf9 cells into aggregates of PTPmu-expressing cells. Homophilic binding has been demonstrated between PTPmu-coated fluorescent beads (Covaspheres) and endogenously expressed PTPmu on MvLu cells. Additionally the PTPmu-coated beads specifically bound to a bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein containing the extracellular segment of PTPmu (GST/PTPmu) adsorbed to petri dishes. Covaspheres coated with the GST/PTPmu fusion protein aggregated in vitro and also bound to PTPmu expressed endogenously on MvLu cells. These results suggest that the ligand for this transmembrane PTPase is another PTPmu molecule on an adjacent cell. Thus homophilic binding interactions may be an important component of the function of PTPmu in vivo.",,
18031695,Homotypic interactions mediated by Slamf1 and Slamf6 receptors control NKT cell lineage development.,"Commitment to the T and natural killer T (NKT) cell lineages is determined during alphabeta T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated interactions of common precursors with ligand-expressing cells in the thymus. Whereas mainstream thymocyte precursors recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ligands expressed by stromal cells, NKT cell precursors interact with CD1d ligands expressed by cortical thymocytes. Here, we demonstrated that such homotypic T-T interactions generated ""second signals"" mediated by the cooperative engagement of the homophilic receptors Slamf1 (SLAM) and Slamf6 (Ly108) and the downstream recruitment of the adaptor SLAM-associated protein (SAP) and the Src kinase Fyn, which are essential for the lineage expansion and differentiation of the NKT cell lineage. These receptor interactions were required during TCR engagement and therefore only occurred when selecting ligands were presented by thymocytes rather than epithelial cells, which do not express Slamf6 or Slamf1. Thus, the topography of NKT cell ligand recognition determines the availability of a cosignaling pathway that is essential for NKT cell lineage development.",,
11336643,Human alpha1-acid glycoprotein binds to CCR5 expressed on the plasma membrane of human primary macrophages.,"We have reported previously that human alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP) inhibits the infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) by R5 HIV-1, and that a disulphide-bridged peptide mimicking the clade B HIV-1 gp120 consensus V3 domain (V3Cs) binds specifically to CCR5 (the major co-receptor of R5 HIV strains) on these cells [Seddiki, Rabehi, Benjouad, Saffar, Ferriere, Gluckman and Gattegno (1997) Glycobiology 7, 1229-1236]. The present study demonstrates that AGP binds specifically to MDM at high- and low-affinity binding sites with K(d) values of 16 nM and 4.9 microM respectively. The fact that heat denaturation of AGP only partly inhibited this binding (43%) suggests that protein-protein interactions are involved, as well as AGP glycans which are resistant to heat denaturation. Mannan, but not dextran, is a significant inhibitor (52%) of this binding, and sequential exoglycosidase treatment of AGP, which exposes penultimate mannose residues, has a strong stimulatory effect ( approximately 2.8-fold). Therefore AGP glycans (probably mannose residues) are involved, at least partly, in the binding of AGP to MDM. In addition, AGP inhibits the binding of V3Cs and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta) to MDM. The anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody 2D7, specific for the second extracellular loop of CCR5, also inhibited AGP binding (67%), whereas anti-CCR5 antibodies specific for the C-terminus of CCR5 region had no effect. Native AGP, like V3Cs (but not heat-denatured AGP), binds to 46 and 33-36 kDa electroblotted AGP-bound MDM membrane ligands, characterized as CCR5 by their interactions with anti-CCR5 antibodies and with MIP-1beta. Therefore both AGP glycans and MDM CCR5 are involved in the binding of AGP to MDM. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of AGP on the infection of human primary macrophages by R5 HIV-1 may be related to specific binding of AGP to a macrophage membrane lectin or lectin-like component and to CCR5.",The Biochemical journal,2001
9725198,Human anaphylatoxin C4a is a potent agonist of the guinea pig but not the human C3a receptor.,"The interaction of human anaphylatoxin C4a with the guinea pig (gp) and human (hu) C3a receptors (C3aR) was analyzed using human rC4a, which exhibited C4a-specific activity on guinea pig platelets. A gpC3aR of 475 residues with a large second extracellular loop and a peptide sequence approximately 60% identical to the huC3aR was isolated from a genomic DNA library and found to be expressed in guinea pig heart, lung, and spleen. HEK-293 cells cotransfected with this clone, and a cDNA encoding G alpha-16 specifically bound (Kd = 1.6+/-0.7 nM) and responded functionally to C3a with an intracellular calcium mobilization (ED50 = 0.18+/-0.02 nM). Human rC4a weakly bound to both the hu- and gpC3aR (IC50 > 1 microM). However, only HEK-293 cells expressing the gpC3aR responded functionally to rC4a (ED50 = 8.7+/-0.52 nM), while cells expressing the huC3aR did not (c < or = 1 microM). Thus, through an interaction with the C3aR, huC4a may elicit anaphylatoxic effects in guinea pigs but not in man.",,
7850406,Human angiotensin receptor subtypes.,"The rapid expansion of our knowledge of angiotensin receptors has been led by the development of subtype-specific angiotensin II receptor antagonists and by the cloning and sequencing of the AT1 receptor in angiotensin II. Although some actions of angiotensin II have been attributed to AT2 subtype receptors, the importance of these binding sites remains elusive. Nonpeptide, AT1-selective antagonists, such as losartan, block virtually all of the well-known effects of angiotensin II in mammalian cells. The effects of losartan are now being confirmed by the rapidly developing class of nonpeptide, AT1-selective angiotensin II receptor antagonists. In rodents, subtypes of the AT1 receptor have been cloned and designated AT1A and AT1B, but they have not been functionally distinguished. Such isoforms have not been identified for human AT1 receptors. Importantly, it now appears that the AT2 receptor has been cloned. The angiotensin receptors undergoing intense study are those in fetal tissue, brain, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Angiotensin II-induced growth and cardiovascular hypertrophy are the focus of broad-based research efforts. The clinical relevance of angiotensin II receptor subtypes is unknown, but there is growing evidence that AT1-selective agents are effective inhibitors of the angiotensin system in humans.",,
11554781,Human B cell-attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1; CXCL13) is an agonist for the human CXCR3 receptor.,"The CXC chemokine CXCL13, known as BCA-1 (B cell-attracting chemokine 1) or BLC (B-lymphocyte chemoattractant), has been identified as an efficacious attractant selective for B lymphocytes. The chemokine receptor BLR1 (Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1)/CXCR5 expressed by all mature B cells has to date been identified as the only known receptor for BCA-1. As the loss of the BLR1/CXCR5 receptor is sufficient to disrupt organization of follicles in spleen and Peyer's patches, BCA-1 may act as a B cell homing chemokine. Nonetheless, BCA-1 has not been tested against all known chemokine receptors. In this study, we report that human BCA-1 competes with radiolabeled interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) inducible protein 10 (IP-10) for binding to the human CXCR3 receptor expressed in Ba/F3 and 293EBNA cell lines. Furthermore, human BCA-1 is an efficacious attractant for human CXCR3 transfected cells; BCA-1-induced chemotaxis is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against human CXCR3. In these cells, as in human B lymphocytes expressing CXCR5, BCA-1 does not induce a calcium flux. Indeed, BCA-1 attenuates the calcium flux induced by IP-10. In addition, human BCA-1 is an agonist in stimulating GTP gamma S binding. Together these data suggest that human BCA-1 is a specific and functional G-protein-linked chemotactic ligand for the human CXCR3 receptor. The biological significance of this new finding is supported by our recent observation that human BCA-1 induces chemotaxis of activated T cells and the BCA-1-induced chemotaxis is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against human CXCR3.",Cytokine,2001
7534620,Human B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) bind with similar avidities but distinct kinetics to CD28 and CTLA-4 receptors.,"B7-0 or B7-2 (CD86) is a T cell costimulatory molecule that binds the same receptors (CD28 and CTLA-4) as B7-1 (CD80), but shares with it only approximately 25% sequence identity and is expressed earlier during an immune response. Here we show that human CD86 maintains similar (within approximately 2- to 3-fold) overall receptor binding and T cell costimulatory properties as CD80. However, CD80 and CD86 did not bind equivalently to CTLA-4: CD80 bound Y100A, a form of CTLA4lg with a mutation in the CDR3-like region, > 200-fold better than did CD86; inhibition of CD80-mediated cellular responses required approximately 100-fold lower CTLA4lg concentrations; and CD80-CTLA4lg complexes dissociated 5- to 8-fold more slowly, Thus, CD80 and CD86 utilize different binding determinants and have different kinetics of binding to CD28 and CTLA-4.",Immunity,1994
11470772,"Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes.","Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine selectively expressed in the liver. Here, we investigated its receptor usage by calcium mobilization and chemotactic assays using mouse L1.2 pre-B cell lines stably expressing a panel of 12 human chemokine receptors. At relatively high concentrations, LEC induced calcium mobilization and chemotaxis via CCR1 and CCR2. LEC also induced calcium mobilization, but marginal chemotaxis via CCR5. Consistently, LEC was found to bind to CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 with relatively low affinities. The binding of LEC to CCR8 was much less significant. In spite of its binding to CCR5, LEC was unable to inhibit infection of an R5-type HIV-1 to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells even at high concentrations. In human liver sections, hepatocytes were strongly stained by anti-LEC antibody. HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, was found to constitutively express LEC. LEC was also present in the plasma samples from healthy adult donors at relatively high concentrations (0.3--4 nM). Taken together, LEC is a new low-affinity functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and is constitutively expressed by liver parenchymal cells. The presence of LEC in normal plasma at relatively high concentrations may modulate inflammatory responses.",International immunology,2001
9551996,"Human CD38 (ADP-ribosyl cyclase) is a counter-receptor of CD31, an Ig superfamily member.","Human CD38 is a cell surface molecule involved in the regulation of lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. This suggests that HUVEC bear a ligand(s) for CD38 on the cell surface. By means of the mAb Moon-1, which specifically inhibits CD38-mediated cell adhesion, we have identified a trans-membrane 130-kDa molecule acting as a ligand for CD38. Here, we report that the molecule recognized by the Moon-1 mAb is CD31, a member of the Ig superfamily. This conclusion is based on 1) cross-inhibition assays between Moon-1 and reference anti-CD31 mAbs; 2) sequential immunoprecipitation experiments using Moon-1 and known anti-CD31 mAbs, and 3) reactivity of the Moon-1 mAb with CD31 transfectants. Further, CD31 and CD38 cognate interactions were found to modulate heterotypic adhesion as well as to implement cytoplasmic calcium fluxes identical to those obtained by means of agonistic anti-CD38 mAbs. Other effects tested included the synthesis of messages for a panel of cytokines, markedly increased upon receptor-ligand interactions. These results suggest that the interplay between CD38 and its ligand CD31 is an important step in the regulation of cell life and of the migration of leukocytes (and CD38+ cancer cells) through the endothelial cell wall.",,
9811967,Human collagen II peptide 256-271 preferentially binds to HLA-DR molecules associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis.,"The binding ability of 23 overlapping peptides, all derived from the CB11 fragment of CII, was tested on several HLA-DR molecules associated or not with disease susceptibility. These experiments were performed on a variety of cells expressing different HLA-DR molecules, using both indirect and direct binding assays. The CII (256-271) fragment was shown to bind to a restricted population among which the HLA-DR molecules associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis. The results also clearly indicate that the binding specificity of CII (256-271), among the DR4 molecules, is controlled by the nature of the HLA-DR molecule beta-chain residues 71 and 74, residues previously shown by X-ray crystallography to be involved in the HLA-DR/peptide interaction. The human CII (256-271) peptide is thus likely to play a role in the disease process.",Immunogenetics,1999
12967681,Human cord blood-derived mast cells synthesize and release I-309 in response to IgE.,"Mast cells are the central mediating cells of allergic reactions. Binding of allergen specific IgE to high affinity IgE receptor (Fcepsilon RI) and subsequent binding of allergen by the IgE causes receptor cross-linking and activation. In a study examining the differential gene expression in human cord blood-derived mast cells (CBMCs) mediated by activation of Fcepsilon RI both with IgE and IgE followed by cross-linking with alpha-IgE, the chemokine I-309 was found to be upregulated. I-309 is the ligand for the CCR8 receptor and is responsible for chemoattraction of TH2 type T-cells. Interestingly, I-309 RNA and protein levels were elevated not only in response to IgE/alpha-IgE activation but also by IgE alone. In addition, the I-309 levels were augmented by growth of the CBMCs in the presence of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-4. GM-CSF and MIP-1alpha secretion was also induced by IgE. These results suggest that IgE, through the production and release of cytokines such as I-309, GM-CSF and MIP-1alpha could promote an inflammatory reaction in the absence of antigen stimulation of mast cells.",,
12907451,Human dendritic cells express neuronal Eph receptor tyrosine kinases: role of EphA2 in regulating adhesion to fibronectin.,"Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, have been primarily described in the nervous system for their roles in axon guidance, development, and cell intermingling. Here we address whether Eph receptors may also regulate dendritic cell (DC) trafficking. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that DCs derived from CD34+ progenitors, but not from monocytes, expressed several receptors, in particular EphA2, EphA4, EphA7, EphB1, and EphB3 mRNA. EphB3 was specifically expressed by Langerhans cells, and EphA2 and EphA7 were expressed by both Langerhans- and interstitial-type DCs. EphA and EphB protein expression on DCs generated in vitro was confirmed by staining with ephrin-A3-Fc and ephrin-B3-Fc fusion proteins that bind to different Eph members, in particular EphA2 and EphB3. Immunostaining with anti-EphA2 antibodies demonstrated the expression of EphA2 by immature DCs and by skin Langerhans cells isolated ex vivo. Interestingly, ephrin expression was detected in epidermal keratinocytes and also in DCs. Adhesion of CD34+-derived DCs to fibronectin, but not to poly-l-lysine, was increased in the presence of ephrin-A3-Fc, a ligand of EphA2, through a beta1 integrin activation pathway. As such, EphA2/ephrin-A3 interactions may play a role in the localization and network of Langerhans cells in the epithelium and in the regulation of their trafficking.",,
10801853,Human factor XII binding to the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.,"Factor XII deficiency has been postulated to be a risk factor for thrombosis suggesting that factor XII is an antithrombotic protein. The biochemical mechanism leading to this clinical observation is unknown. We have previously reported high molecular weight kininogen (HK) inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by binding to the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex. Although factor XII will bind to the intact platelet through GP Ibalpha (glycocalicin) without activation, we now report that factor XIIa (0. 37 microm), but not factor XII zymogen, is required for the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XIIa had no significant effect on SFLLRN-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover, an antibody to the thrombin site on protease-activated receptor-1 failed to block factor XII binding to platelets. Inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was demonstrated with factor XIIa but not with factor XII zymogen or factor XIIf, indicating that the conformational exposure of the heavy chain following proteolytic activation is required for inhibition. However, inactivation of the catalytic activity of factor XIIa did not affect the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XII showed displacement of biotin-labeled HK (30 nm) binding to gel-filtered platelets and, at concentrations of 50 nm, was able to block 50% of the HK binding, suggesting involvement of the GP Ib complex. Antibodies to GP Ib and GP IX, which inhibited HK binding to platelets, did not block factor XII binding. However, using a biosensor, which monitors protein-protein interactions, both HK and factor XII bind to GP Ibalpha. Factor XII may serve to regulate thrombin binding to the GP Ib receptor by co-localizing with HK, to control the extent of platelet aggregation in vivo.",,
10557084,Human frizzled 1 interacts with transforming Wnts to transduce a TCF dependent transcriptional response.,"The human homologue of fz1 (Hfz1) was cloned from a cDNA library. Hfz1 was shown to couple to Wnt signal transduction pathways by its ability to enhance Wnt induced TCF dependent transcription in both autocrine and paracrine modes. Enhanced TCF dependent signaling was dose dependent with respect to both Wnt-3A and Hfz1. Moreover, Hfz1 deletion mutants with truncated carboxy termini showed markedly reduced capacity to enhance Wnt signal transduction. Specificity was demonstrated with respect to signal transduction by different Wnts. While Wnt-3a, -3, -1 and to a lesser extent Wnt-2 cooperated with Hfz1 in the paracrine assay for TCF dependent signaling, neither Wnt-4, -5a, -5b, -6, -7a nor -7b did so, despite similar levels of expression. However, coimmunoprecipitation of Hfz1 with both Wnt-3a and Wnt-5a indicated that TCF dependent signaling in response to Wnts is not determined solely by their ability to bind the receptor. All of these findings provide strong evidence that Hfz1 is a functional partner for certain Wnts in inducing TCF dependent transcription.",Oncogene,1999
11116144,Human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha 4 is the receptor for persephin and is predominantly expressed in normal and malignant thyroid medullary cells.,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands signal through receptor complex consisting of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked GDNF family receptor (GFR) alpha subunit and the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase RET. The inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), associated with different mutations in RET, is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma. GDNF signals via GFRalpha1, neurturin via GFRalpha2, artemin via GFRalpha3, whereas the mammalian GFRalpha receptor for persephin (PSPN) is unknown. Here we characterize the human GFRalpha4 as the ligand-binding subunit required together with RET for PSPN signaling. Human and mouse GFRalpha4 lack the first Cys-rich domain characteristic of other GFRalpha receptors. Unlabeled PSPN displaces (125)I-PSPN from GFRA4-transfected cells, which express endogenous Ret. PSPN can be specifically cross-linked to mammalian GFRalpha4 and Ret, and is able to promote autophosphorylation of Ret in GFRA4-transfected cells. PSPN, but not other GDNF family ligands, promotes the survival of cultured sympathetic neurons microinjected with GFRA4. We identified different splice forms of human GFRA4 mRNA encoding for two glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked and one putative soluble isoform that were predominantly expressed in the thyroid gland. Overlapping expression of RET and GFRA4 but not other GFRA mRNAs in normal and malignant thyroid medullary cells suggests that GFRalpha4 may restrict the MEN2 syndrome to these cells.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
7527811,Human IL-12 p40 homodimer binds to the IL-12 receptor but does not mediate biologic activity.,"IL-12, a heterodimeric cytokine, consists of two disulfide-linked subunits, p40 and p35. We investigated the role of p40 in ligand binding and signal transduction by expressing this subunit alone in COS cells. Culture media of the transfected COS cells exhibited specific dose-dependent binding to KIT225/K6 cells, a human T cell line that expresses IL-12R. Analysis of the culture media by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting demonstrated the presence of 40-kDa monomers and 80-kDa disulfide-linked homodimers. The two p40 species were purified and identified by N-terminal sequencing and proteolytic peptide mapping. Characterization of the p40 proteins for binding and bioactivity showed that both the p40 monomer and dimer inhibited 125I-labeled IL-12 binding to IL-12R, but the 80-kDa species, having a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 20 to 70 ng/ml, was at least 20-fold more effective than the monomer. Although neither the monomer nor the dimer stimulated human PHA-blast proliferation, the 80-kDa dimer inhibited IL-12-induced proliferation in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 65 ng/ml. The results suggest that the IL-12 p40 subunit contains the essential epitopes for receptor binding. However, a proper conformation required for high affinity binding is achieved only when p40 is associated with a p35 subunit or another p40 subunit. When p40 is associated with a p35 subunit, the heterodimer acts as an agonist mediating biologic activity. However, when p40 associates with another p40, the homodimer behaves as an antagonist in vitro.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1995
12853576,Human inhibitory receptors Ig-like transcript 2 (ILT2) and ILT4 compete with CD8 for MHC class I binding and bind preferentially to HLA-G.,"Ig-like transcript 4 (ILT4) (also known as leukocyte Ig-like receptor 2, CD85d, and LILRB2) is a cell surface receptor expressed mainly on myelomonocytic cells, whereas ILT2 (also known as leukocyte Ig-like receptor 1, CD85j, and LILRB1) is expressed on a wider range of immune cells including subsets of natural killer and T cells. Both ILTs contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory receptor motifs in their cytoplasmic tails that inhibit cellular responses by recruiting phosphatases such as SHP-1 (Src homology 2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase 1). Although these ILTs have been shown to recognize a broad range of classical and nonclassical human MHC class I molecules (MHCIs), their precise binding properties remain controversial. We have used surface plasmon resonance to analyze the interaction of soluble forms of ILT4 and ILT2 with several MHCIs. Although the range of affinities measured was quite broad (Kd = 2-45 microM), some interesting differences were observed. ILT2 generally bound with a 2- to 3-fold higher affinity than ILT4 to the same MHCI. Furthermore, ILT2 and ILT4 bound to HLA-G with a 3- to 4-fold higher affinity than to classical MHCIs, suggesting that ILT/HLA-G recognition may play a dominant role in the regulation of natural killer, T, and myelomonocytic cell activation. Finally, we show that ILT2 and ILT4 effectively compete with CD8 for MHCI binding, raising the possibility that ILT2 modulates CD8+ T cell activation by blocking the CD8 binding as well as by recruiting inhibitory molecules through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory receptor motif.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2003
1834641,Human interferon omega (omega) binds to the alpha/beta receptor.,"It was proposed that human interferon omega (omega) binds to the interferon alpha/beta receptor but not to the interferon gamma receptor. However, since no studies were performed to provide direct evidence for this hypothesis, we carried out cross-linking experiments and saturation binding assays between a 32P-labeled human interferon-alpha (Hu-IFN-alpha) and unlabeled Hu-IFN-alpha A, -beta, -gamma, and -omega. These assays demonstrated that Hu-IFN-alpha A, -beta, and -omega, but not Hu-IFN-gamma, were able to block binding of 32P-labeled Hu-IFN-alpha A to human cells. These results indicate that Hu-IFN-omega binds to the alpha/beta receptor.",,
8649415,"Human interleukin-3 (IL-3) induces disulfide-linked IL-3 receptor alpha- and beta-chain heterodimerization, which is required for receptor activation but not high-affinity binding.","The human interleukin-3 receptor (IL-3R) is a heterodimer that comprises an IL-3 specific alpha chain (IL-3R alpha) and a common beta chain (beta C) that is shared with the receptors for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-5. These receptors belong to the cytokine receptor superfamily, but they are structurally and functionally more related to each other and thus make up a distinct subfamily. Although activation of the normal receptor occurs only in the presence of ligand, the underlying mechanisms are not known. We show here that human IL-3 induces heterodimerization of IL-3R alpha and beta c and that disulfide linkage of these chains is involved in receptor activation but not high-affinity binding. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to IL-3R alpha and beta c were developed which immunoprecipitated, in the absence of IL-3, the respective chains from cells labelled with 125I on the cell surface. However, in the presence of IL-3, each MAb immunoprecipitated both IL-3R alpha and beta c. IL-3-induced receptor dimers were disulfide and nondisulfide linked and were dependent on IL-3 interacting with both IL-3R alpha and beta c. In the presence of IL-3 and under nonreducing conditions, MAb to either IL-3R alpha or beta c immunoprecipitated complexes with apparent molecular weights of 215,000 and 245,000 and IL-3R alpha and beta c monomers. Preincubation with iodoacetamide prevented the formation of the two high-molecular-weight complexes without affecting noncovalent dimer formation or high-affinity IL-3 binding. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (immunoblotting) demonstrated the presence of both IL-3R alpha and beta c in the disulfide-linked complexes. IL-3 could also be coimmunoprecipitated with anti-IL-3R alpha or anti-beta c MAB, but it was not covalently attached to the receptor. Following IL-3 stimulation, only the disulfide-linked heterodimers exhibited reactivity with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, with beta c but not IL-3R alpha being the phosphorylated species. A model of IL-3R activation is proposed which may be also applicable to the related GM-CSF and IL-5 receptors.",,
10233762,Human IP-9: A keratinocyte-derived high affinity CXC-chemokine ligand for the IP-10/Mig receptor (CXCR3).,"Chemokines and their receptors play a crucial part in the recruitment of leukocytes into inflammatory sites. The CXC chemokines IP-10 and Mig are selective attractants for activated (memory) T cells, the predominant cell type in skin infiltrates in many inflammatory dermatoses. The selectivity for activated T cells can be explained by the fact that both chemokines exert their effects through a common receptor, CXCR3, which is nearly exclusively expressed on activated T cells. The aim of this study was to identify biologically active CXCR3 ligands produced by keratinocytes. To that end, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a cDNA encoding CXCR3 were challenged with proteins obtained from interferon-gamma stimulated keratinocytes and subsequently monitored for effects on second messenger systems. By this approach we were able to isolate IP-10 and Mig, and in addition identified a novel highly potent ligand for the CXCR3 receptor, designated interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9, which proved to be chemotactic for activated T cells expressing CXCR3. Protein sequence and mass spectrometric analysis followed by molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9, revealed that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 is a CXC chemokine with a molecular mass of 8303 Da. From a GenBank database query it became clear that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 is in fact the protein encoded by the cDNA sequence also known as beta-R1, H174 or I-TAC. In situ hybridization experiments showed that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 mRNA is expressed by basal layer keratinocytes in a variety of skin disorders, including allergic contact dermatitis, lichen planus, and mycosis fungoides suggesting a functional role for this chemokine in skin immune responses.",The Journal of investigative dermatology,1999
9269768,Human kininogens regulate thrombin binding to platelets through the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex.,"We and others have shown that both high and low molecular mass kininogens are able to inhibit the thrombin-induced aggregation of gel-filtered platelets, indicating that the locus for inhibition resides in the heavy chain. The inhibitory site is present in domain 3, confined to the C-terminal portion of the region encoded by exon 7 (K270-G292), and the minimal effective sequence is a heptapeptide (L271-A277; Kunapuli et al, J Biol Chem 271:11228, 1996). Kininogens inhibit thrombin binding to platelets and thus inhibit thrombin-induced aggregation. The molecular mechanism by which kininogens inhibit thrombin-induced aggregation of platelets is unknown. Thrombin has previously been shown to bind to two receptors on the platelet surface, glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex and the hepta-spanning transmembrane receptor coupled to G protein(s). We now show that, unlike its effect on normal platelets, kininogen (2 micromol/L) did not inhibit the thrombin-induced aggregation of Bernard-Soulier platelets, which lack the GP Ib-IX-V complex, suggesting that kininogen interacts either directly or indirectly with that complex and restricts access by thrombin to this receptor. We further show that both recombinant K270-G292 polypeptide and the synthetic peptide L271-A277 derived from high molecular mass kininogen lower thrombin binding to platelets in a manner similar to monoclonal antibodies to or ligands (von Willebrand factor and echicetin) of GP Ib-IX. The anti-GP Ib-IX-V complex antibodies, TM-60 and SZ 2, can inhibit 125I-high molecular mass kininogen binding to platelets. Conversely, kininogen could block the binding of biotinylated TM-60 or of 125I-SZ 2. Kininogen inhibited the binding of biotinylated thrombin bound to a mouse fibroblast cell line transfected with the GP Ib-IX-V complex. These results indicated that kininogen binds to the GP Ib-IX-V complex modulating thrombin binding to platelets and the consequent platelet aggregation. Kininogen can thus serve as an important regulator of the early stages of platelet stimulation by thrombin.",,

Our previous studies have identified the peptide IGNSNTL as a binding sequence of Kringle 5 using Ph.D.-7 phage display peptide library and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Here, eleven proteins were screened and summarized by BLAST, laminin α3 chain G1 domain (LG1) was considered as the most potential receptor based on E value and domain function. The specific interaction of them was directly revealed through ligand blot and a strong concentration-dependent manner occurred between them (K",Journal of chromatography. A,2020
18055229,Human leukocyte antigen-B-associated transcript 3 is released from tumor cells and engages the NKp30 receptor on natural killer cells.,"The activity of natural killer (NK) cells is regulated by surface receptors, which direct target cell recognition. NKp30 (Natural Cytotoxicity Receptor 3) induces target cell lysis and is also crucial for the interaction with dendritic cells. So far, the cellular ligands for NKp30 have remained elusive. Here we show that the nuclear factor HLA-B-associated transcript 3 (BAT3) was released from tumor cells, bound directly to NKp30, and engaged NKp30 on NK cells. BAT3 triggered NKp30-mediated cytotoxicity and was necessary for tumor rejection in a multiple myeloma model. These data identify BAT3 as a cellular ligand for NKp30. We propose a concept for target cell recognition by NK cells beyond ""missing self"" and ""induced self,"" mediated through a tumor cell-derived extracellular factor.",,
9538010,Human low-molecular-weight salivary mucin expresses the sialyl lewisx determinant and has L-selectin ligand activity.,"Previously we showed that the low-molecular-weight mucin (MG2, encoded by MUC7), a major component of human submandibular/sublingual saliva, is a bacterial receptor that coats the tooth surface. Here we tested the hypothesis that the structure of its carbohydrate residues contains important information about its function. Purified MG2 (Mr 120 000) was digested with trypsin, and the resulting Mr 90 000 fragment, which carried primarily O-linked oligosaccharides, was subjected to reductive beta-elimination. The released oligosaccharides were characterized by using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Of the 41 different structures we detected, the most prominent included NeuAcalpha2-->3Galbeta1-->3GalNAc-ol (sialyl-T antigen), Galbeta1-->4(Fucalpha1-->3)GlcNAcbeta1-->6(Galbeta1 -->3)GalNAc-ol [type 2 core with Lewisx (Lex) determinant], and NeuAcalpha2-->3Galbeta1-->4(Fucalpha1-->3)GlcNAcbet a1-->6(Galbeta1--> 3) GalNAc-ol [type 2 core with sialyl Lex (sLex) determinant]. We also detected di-, tri-, and pentasaccharides with one sulfate group. Lex, sLex, and related sulfated structures are ligands for selectins, adhesion molecules that mediate leukocyte trafficking. Therefore, we investigated whether MG2 was a selectin ligand. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, L-selectin chimeras interacted with immobilized MG2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. L-Selectin chimeras also bound to MG2 immobilized on nitrocellulose. Together, these results suggest that the saccharides that MG2 carries could specify some of its important functions, which may include mediating leukocyte interactions in the oral cavity.",Biochemistry,1998
15294972,Human lymphocytes interact directly with CD47 through a novel member of the signal regulatory protein (SIRP) family.,"Two closely related proteins, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha; SHPS-1/CD172) and SIRPbeta, have been described in humans. The existence of a third SIRP protein has been suggested by cDNA sequence only. We show that this third SIRP is a separate gene that is expressed as a protein with unique characteristics from both alpha and beta genes and suggest that this gene should be termed SIRPgamma. We have expressed the extracellular region of SIRPgamma as a soluble protein and have shown that, like SIRPalpha, it binds CD47, but with a lower affinity (K(d), approximately 23 microM) compared with SIRPalpha (K(d), approximately 2 microM). mAbs specific to SIRPgamma show that it was not expressed on myeloid cells, in contrast to SIRPalpha and -beta, being expressed instead on the majority of T cells and a proportion of B cells. The short cytoplasmic tail of SIRPgamma does not contain any known signaling motifs, nor does it contain a characteristic lysine, as with SIRPbeta, that is required for DAP12 interaction. DAP12 coexpression is a requirement for SIRPbeta surface expression, whereas SIRPgamma is expressed in its absence. The SIRPgamma-CD47 interaction may therefore not be capable of bidirectional signaling as with the SIRPalpha-CD47, but, instead, use unidirectional signaling via CD47 only.",,
9531263,Human myelomonocytic cells express an inhibitory receptor for classical and nonclassical MHC class I molecules.,"Leukocyte activation can be negatively regulated by inhibitory receptors specific for MHC class I molecules. While one inhibitory receptor, Ig-like transcript 2 (ILT2), is expressed by all lymphoid and myelomonocytic cell types, other receptors display a more selective tissue distribution. Here we characterize an inhibitory receptor, termed ILT4, which is selectively expressed in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), binds classical class I molecules and the nonclassical class I molecules HLA-G, and transduces negative signals that can inhibit early signaling events triggered by stimulatory receptors. ILT4 may control inflammatory responses and cytotoxicity mediated by myelomonocytic cells and may modulate their Ag-presenting functions, focusing immune responses to microbial challenges and avoiding autoreactivity.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1998
8046333,Human natural killer cell receptors for HLA-class I molecules. Evidence that the Kp43 (CD94) molecule functions as receptor for HLA-B alleles.,"GL183 or EB6 (p58) molecules have been shown to function as receptors for different HLA-C alleles and to deliver an inhibitory signal to natural killer (NK) cells, thus preventing lysis of target cells. In this study, we analyzed a subset of NK cells characterized by a p58-negative surface phenotype. We show that p58-negative clones, although specific for class I molecules do not recognize HLA-C alleles. In addition, by the use of appropriate target cells transfected with different HLA-class I alleles we identified HLA-B7 as the protective element recognized by a fraction of p58-negative clones. In an attempt to identify the receptor molecules expressed by HLA-B7-specific clones, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were selected after mice immunization with such clones. Two of these mAbs, termed XA-88 and XA-185, and their F(ab')2 fragments, were found to reconstitute lysis of B7+ target cells by B7-specific NK clones. Both mAbs were shown to be directed against the recently clustered Kp43 molecule (CD94). Thus, mAb-mediated masking of Kp43 molecules interferes with recognition of HLA-B7 and results in target cell lysis. Moreover, in a redirected killing assay, the cross-linking of Kp43 molecules mediated by the XA185 mAb strongly inhibited the cytolytic activity of HLA-B7-specific NK clones, thus mimicking the functional effect of B7 molecules. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Kp43 molecules function as receptors for HLA-B7 and that this receptor/ligand interaction results in inhibition of the NK-mediated cytolytic activity. Indirect immunofluorescence and FACS analysis of a large number of random NK clones showed that Kp43 molecules (a) were brightly expressed on a subset of p58-negative clones, corresponding to those specific for HLA-B7; (b) displayed a medium/low fluorescence in the p58-negative clones that are not B7-specific as well as in most p58+ NK clones; and (c) were brightly expressed as in the p58+ clone ET34 (GL183-/EB6+, Cw4-specific). Functional analysis revealed that Kp43 functioned as an inhibitory receptor only in NK clones displaying bright fluorescence. These studies also indicate that some NK clones (e.g., the ET34) can coexpress two distinct receptors (p58 and Kp43) for different class I alleles (Cw4 and B7). Finally, we show that Kp43 molecules function as receptors only for some HLA-B alleles and that still undefined receptor(s) must exist for other HLA-B alleles including B27.",The Journal of experimental medicine,1994
11024295,Human nectin3/PRR3: a novel member of the PVR/PRR/nectin family that interacts with afadin.,"We have isolated nectin3/PRR3, the fourth human member of the nectin/PRR family, also described as the alpha herpes virus receptor family. Nectin/PRR members are adhesion molecules expressed at intercellular junctions. Nectin3/PRR3 is a transmembrane protein, whose extracellular region contains three Ig-like domains (V, C and C) and shares approximately 30% identity with the other members. It is mainly expressed in testis and placental tissues. SDS-PAGE analyses demonstrate that nectin3/PRR3 has a molecular weight of 83kDa. Nectin1/PRR1L and nectin2/PRR2S and L were found to be specifically expressed at the intercellular junctions. This localization is in part due to the interaction of the C-terminal part of these receptors (ended by the consensus sequence A/EXYV) and the PDZ domain of afadin. In this report we demonstrate that the nectin3/PRR3 receptor carries the A/EXYV consensus sequence and interacts in vivo with both long and short isoforms of afadin. These results suggest that the human nectin3/PRR3 is a new afadin-associated molecule.",,
12548712,Human neuronal cells (NT2-N) express functional substance P and neurokinin-1 receptor coupled to MIP-1 beta expression.,"Substance P (SP), the most extensively studied and potent member of the tachykinin family, is a major modulator of inflammation and immunomodulatory activities within the central and peripheral nervous systems. We have examined the gene expression of SP and its receptor in a human neuronal cell line (NT2-N). Using reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the four isoforms of preprotachykinin-A gene transcripts (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) were detected in the NT2-N. We also identified the presence of mRNA for neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), a primary receptor for SP, in the NT2-N cells. Concomitant with NT2 cell differentiation into neurons, SP and NK-1R mRNA expression increased consistently. Intracellular SP and cell membrane NK-1R immunoreactivity were all observed in NT2-N cells. Most importantly, we demonstrated that SP and NK-1R presented in NT2-N cells are functionally involved in the regulation of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta (MIP-1beta), an important beta-chemokine participating in the activation and directional migration of immune cells to sites of central nervous systems (CNS) inflammation. Thus, SP and its receptor may play an important role in modulation of neuronal functions related to regulation of immune activities within the CNS. The NT2-N cell line is well suited for in vitro investigations of the SP-NK-1R pathway in immune responses and inflammation in the CNS.",,
9558116,Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes adhere to complement factor H through an interaction that involves alphaMbeta2 (CD11b/CD18).,"The work presented here demonstrates that human complement factor H is an adhesion ligand for human neutrophils but not for eosinophils. The adherence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to plastic wells coated with factor H depended on divalent metal ions and was augmented by C5a and TNF-alpha. PMN adhesion to factor H in the presence or absence of C5a was blocked specifically by mAbs against CD11b or CD18. Affinity purification using factor H Sepharose followed by immunoprecipitation using mAbs to various integrin chains identified Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) as a factor H binding receptor. The presence of surface bound factor H enhanced neutrophil activation resulting in a two- to fivefold increase in the generation of hydrogen peroxide by PMNs stimulated by C5a or TNF-alpha. When factor H was mixed with PMNs, 1.4 to 3.8-fold more cells adhered to immobilized heparin or chondroitin A. In addition, augmented adhesion of PMNs was measured when factor H, but not HSA or C9, was absorbed to wells that were first coated with heparin or chondroitin A. The adhesion of PMNs to glycosaminoglycan-factor H was blocked by mAbs to CD11b and CD18. These studies demonstrate that factor H is an adhesion molecule for human neutrophils and suggest that the interaction of factor H with glycosaminoglycans may facilitate the tethering of this protein in tissues allowing factor H to serve as a neutrophil adhesion ligand in vivo.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1998
16867986,Human receptors patched and smoothened partially transduce hedgehog signal when expressed in Drosophila cells.,"In humans, dysfunctions of the Hedgehog receptors Patched and Smoothened are responsible for numerous pathologies. However, signaling mechanisms involving these receptors are less well characterized in mammals than in Drosophila. To obtain structure-function relationship information on human Patched and Smoothened, we expressed these human receptors in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells. We show here that, as its Drosophila counterpart, human Patched is able to repress the signaling pathway in the absence of Hedgehog ligand. In response to Hedgehog, human Patched is able to release Drosophila Smoothened inhibition, suggesting that human Patched is expressed in a functional state in Drosophila cells. We also provide experiments showing that human Smo, when expressed in Schneider cells, is able to bind the alkaloid cyclopamine, suggesting that it is expressed in a native conformational state. Furthermore, contrary to Drosophila Smoothened, human Smoothened does not interact with the kinesin Costal 2 and thus is unable to transduce the Hedgehog signal. Moreover, cell surface fluorescent labeling suggest that human Smoothened is enriched at the Schneider 2 plasma membrane in response to Hedgehog. These results suggest that human Smoothened is expressed in a functional state in Drosophila cells, where it undergoes a regulation of its localization comparable with its Drosophila homologue. Thus, we propose that the upstream part of the Hedgehog pathway involving Hedgehog interaction with Patched, regulation of Smoothened by Patched, and Smoothened enrichment at the plasma membrane is highly conserved between Drosophila and humans; in contrast, signaling downstream of Smoothened is different.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2006
8621465,"Human ryudocan from endothelium-like cells binds basic fibroblast growth factor, midkine, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor.","Ryudocan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, was isolated from human endothelium-like EAhy926 cells by a combination of ion-exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography. Purified human ryudocan has biochemical properties similar to those of rat ryudocan isolated from microvascular endothelial cells. Human ryudocan contains only heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains along with a core protein with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa. We evaluated the interactions between purified human ryudocan and several extracellular ligands by using a solid-phase binding assay. We found that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), midkine (MK), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) exhibit significant ryudocan binding. Heparitinase (but not chondroitin ABC lyase) treatment destroyed the ability of ryudocan binding to bFGF, MK, and TFPI. Heparin and HS, but not chondroitin sulfate, inhibited such ryudocan binding. Thus, the HS chains of ryudocan appear to be responsible for its binding to bFGF, MK, and TFPI. The apparent dissociation constants for purified ryudocan were as follows: bFGF, 0.50 nM; MK, 0.30 nM; and TFPI, 0.74 nM. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ryudocan was expressed in fibrous connective tissues, peripheral nerve tissues, and placental trophoblasts. These findings suggest that ryudocan may possess multiple biological functions, such as bFGF modulation, neurite growth promotion, and anticoagulation, via HS-binding effectors in the cellular microenvironment.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996

10572074,"Human signal-regulatory protein is expressed on normal, but not on subsets of leukemic myeloid cells and mediates cellular adhesion involving its counterreceptor CD47.","Signal-regulatory proteins (SIRPs) comprise a novel transmembrane glycoprotein family involved in the negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase-coupled signaling pathways. To analyze the expression and function of SIRPs, we prepared soluble recombinant fusion proteins of the extracellular regions of SIRPalpha1 and SIRPalpha2, as well as a variety of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against these domains. The antibodies reacted predominantly with monocytes, granulocytes, dendritic cells, and their precursors, as well as with bone marrow CD34(+), AC133(+), CD90(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. In contrast, SIRP expression was absent or significantly reduced on the majority of myeloid blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Functional studies showed that the extracellular domains of SIRPalpha1 and SIRPalpha2 support adhesion of a number of primary hematopoietic cells and cell lines. This interaction could be blocked by 4 of 7 SIRPalpha1-reactive MoAbs. In addition, SIRPalpha1 and SIRPalpha2 competed for the same cell binding site, suggesting a common widely expressed SIRP ligand. In an approach to identify this molecule, MoAbs were generated against the SIRP-binding cell line CCRF-CEM, and MoAb CC2C6 was selected because of its capacity to inhibit cell binding to SIRPalpha1. Further analysis showed that this antibody recognized CD47, a ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane protein previously implicated in integrin function, host defense action, and neutrophil migration. In this study, we identify CD47 as the extracellular ligand for human SIRP and show that these two counterreceptors are involved in cellular adhesion.",,
17953528,"Human Soluble CD80 is generated by alternative splicing, and recombinant soluble CD80 binds to CD28 and CD152 influencing T-cell activation.","CD80 is a costimulatory factor mainly expressed on the surface of activated monocytes, B cells and dendritic cells. In this study, we demonstrate that 24% of healthy individuals have soluble forms of CD80, sCD80, in their serum. The concentration of sCD80 ranged from 0 to 1 mg/l. At the mRNA level, we detected a spliced form s1CD80 (771 bp), in unstimulated monocytes and B cells, while another form named s2CD80 (489 bp) was expressed in activated T cells as well as in freshly isolated and activated monocytes. s1CD80 lacks the transmembrane domain, and the IgC-like domain plus the transmembrane domain are spliced out of s2CD80. We also present data demonstrating that recombinant s1CD80 binds to recombinant CD152-Ig and CD28-Ig. It can also bind to T cells, preferentially to activated T cells. Recombinant sCD80 had immunomodulatory effects shown by its inhibition of the mixed lymphocyte reaction and inhibition of T-cell proliferation. sCD80 in human serum adds a new member to the family of soluble receptors, implying a network of soluble costimulatory factors with functional relevance. The inhibitory effect of the recombinant protein on T-cell activation makes it a possible candidate for treatment of diseases associated with hyperactivated T cells.",Scandinavian journal of immunology,2007
11329063,Human stresscopin and stresscopin-related peptide are selective ligands for the type 2 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor.,"Adaptive stress responses mediated by the endocrine, autonomic, cardiovascular and immune systems are essential for the survival of the individual. Initial stress-induced responses provide a vital short-term metabolic lift, but prolonged or inappropriate exposure to stress can compromise homeostasis thereby leading to disease. This 'fight-or-flight' response is characterized by the activation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-adrenocorticotropin-glucocorticoid axis, mediated by the type 1 CRH receptor. In contrast, the type 2 CRH receptor mediates the stress-coping responses during the recovery phase of stress. We identified human stresscopin (SCP) and stresscopin-related peptide (SRP) as specific ligands for the type 2 CRH receptor. The genes encoding these peptides were expressed in diverse peripheral tissues as well as in the central nervous system. Treatment with SCP or SRP suppressed food intake, delayed gastric emptying and decreased heat-induced edema. Thus SCP and SRP might represent endogenous ligands for maintaining homeostasis after stress, and could allow the design of drugs to ameliorate stress-related diseases.",Nature medicine,2001
11418668,Human thymic stromal lymphopoietin preferentially stimulates myeloid cells.,"The sequence of a novel hemopoietic cytokine was discovered in a computational screen of genomic databases, and its homology to mouse thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) suggests that it is the human orthologue. Human TSLP is proposed to signal through a heterodimeric receptor complex that consists of a new member of the hemopoietin family termed human TSLP receptor and the IL-7R alpha-chain. Cells transfected with both receptor subunits proliferated in response to purified, recombinant human TSLP, with induced phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5. Human TSLPR and IL-7Ralpha are principally coexpressed on monocytes and dendritic cell populations and to a much lesser extent on various lymphoid cells. In accord, we find that human TSLP functions mainly on myeloid cells; it induces the release of T cell-attracting chemokines from monocytes and, in particular, enhances the maturation of CD11c(+) dendritic cells, as evidenced by the strong induction of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80 and the enhanced capacity to elicit proliferation of naive T cells.",,

12682293,Human tumstatin and human endostatin exhibit distinct antiangiogenic activities mediated by alpha v beta 3 and alpha 5 beta 1 integrins.,"Tumstatin and endostatin are two inhibitors of angiogenesis derived from precursor human collagen molecules known as alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen and alpha1 chain of type XVIII collagen, respectively. Although both these inhibitors are noncollagenous (NC1) domain fragments of collagens, they only share a 14% amino acid homology. In the present study we evaluated the functional receptors, mechanism of action, and intracellular signaling induced by these two collagen-derived inhibitors. Human tumstatin prevents angiogenesis via inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis with no effect on migration, whereas human endostatin prevents endothelial cell migration with no effect on proliferation. We demonstrate that human tumstatin binds to alpha v beta 3 integrin in a vitronectin/fibronectin/RGD cyclic peptide independent manner, whereas human endostatin competes with fibronectin/RGD cyclic peptide to bind alpha 5 beta 1 integrin. The activity of human tumstatin is mediated by alpha v beta 3 integrin, whereas the activity of human endostatin is mediated by alpha 5 beta 1 integrin. Additionally, although human tumstatin binding to alpha v beta 3 integrin leads to the inhibition of Cap-dependent translation (protein synthesis) mediated by focal adhesion kinase/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway, human endostatin binding to alpha 5 beta 1 integrin leads to the inhibition of focal adhesion kinase/c-Raf/MEK1/2/p38/ERK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, with no effect on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 and Cap-dependent translation. Collectively, such distinct properties of human tumstatin and human endostatin provide the first insight into their diverse antiangiogenic actions and argue for combining them for targeting tumor angiogenesis.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2003
7791754,Human type II receptor for bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs): extension of the two-kinase receptor model to the BMPs.,"Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) are universal regulators of animal development. We report the identification and cloning of the BMP type II receptor (BMPR-II), a missing component of this receptor system in vertebrates. BMPR-II is a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase that binds BMP-2 and BMP-7 in association with multiple type I receptors, including BMPR-IA/Brk1, BMPR-IB, and ActR-I, which is also an activin type I receptor. Cloning of BMPR-II resulted from a strong interaction of its cytoplasmic domain with diverse transforming growth factor beta family type I receptor cytoplasmic domains in a yeast two-hybrid system. In mammalian cells, however, the interaction of BMPR-II is restricted to BMP type I receptors and is ligand dependent. BMPR-II binds BMP-2 and -7 on its own, but binding is enhanced by coexpression of type I BMP receptors. BMP-2 and BMP-7 can induce a transcriptional response when added to cells coexpressing ActR-I and BMPR-II but not to cells expressing either receptor alone. The kinase activity of both receptors is essential for signaling. Thus, despite their ability to bind to type I and II receptors receptors separately, BMPs appear to require the cooperation of these two receptors for optimal binding and for signal transduction. The combinatorial nature of these receptors and their capacity to crosstalk with the activin receptor system may underlie the multifunctional nature of their ligands.",,
10499587,Human urotensin-II is a potent vasoconstrictor and agonist for the orphan receptor GPR14.,"Urotensin-II (U-II) is a vasoactive 'somatostatin-like' cyclic peptide which was originally isolated from fish spinal cords, and which has recently been cloned from man. Here we describe the identification of an orphan human G-protein-coupled receptor homologous to rat GPR14 and expressed predominantly in cardiovascular tissue, which functions as a U-II receptor. Goby and human U-II bind to recombinant human GPR14 with high affinity, and the binding is functionally coupled to calcium mobilization. Human U-II is found within both vascular and cardiac tissue (including coronary atheroma) and effectively constricts isolated arteries from non-human primates. The potency of vasoconstriction of U-II is an order of magnitude greater than that of endothelin-1, making human U-II the most potent mammalian vasoconstrictor identified so far. In vivo, human U-II markedly increases total peripheral resistance in anaesthetized non-human primates, a response associated with profound cardiac contractile dysfunction. Furthermore, as U-II immunoreactivity is also found within central nervous system and endocrine tissues, it may have additional activities.",Nature,1999
8074647,Human vasoactive intestinal peptide1 receptors expressed by stable transfectants couple to two distinct signaling pathways.,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a potent neuropeptide mediator of central and peripheral nervous system function. A human VIP1 receptor (HVR) cDNA clone was previously obtained from HT29 intestinal epithelial cells and lung tissue. Stably-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells and chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing about 10(6) HVRs per cell that bind [125I]VIP with a Kd of 0.2-0.8 nM, and specifically recognized by anti-HVR antibodies, were established and characterized. VIP induced increases in intracellular cAMP levels ([cAMP]i) dose-dependently with an EC50 of 0.2 nM in 293 and CHO stable transfectants and concurrently evoked dose-dependent increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i), as determined by fluorescence-dye spectroscopy. Untransfected 293 and CHO cells showed minimal binding or intracellular effects of VIP; however, native VIP1 receptors of HT29 cells also increased [cAMP]i and [Ca2+]i in dose-dependent responses to VIP. Thus recombinant and native human VIP1 receptors both couple to two distinct signal transduction pathways within a single cell type.",,
12133828,Human VPAC1 receptor selectivity filter. Identification of a critical domain for restricting secretin binding.,"The human VPAC1 receptor for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) belongs to the class II family of G protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane segments. It recognizes several VIP-related peptides and displays a very low affinity for secretin despite >70% homology between VIP and secretin. Conversely, the human secretin receptor has high affinity for secretin but low affinity for VIP. We took advantage of this reversed selectivity to identify a domain of the VPAC1 receptor responsible for selectivity toward secretin by constructing human VPAC1-secretin receptor chimeras. A first set of chimeras consisted of exchanging the entire N-terminal ectodomain or large parts of this domain. They were constructed by overlap PCR, transfected in COS-7 cells, and their ligand selectivity, expressed as the ratio of EC(50) for secretin/EC(50) for VIP (referred to as S/V), in stimulating cAMP production was measured. Two very informative chimeras respectively referred to as S144V and S123V were obtained by replacing the entire ectodomain or only the first 123 amino acids of the VPAC1 receptor by the corresponding sequences of the secretin receptor. Whereas S144V no longer discriminated between VIP and secretin (S/V = 1.2), S123V discriminated between the two peptides (S/V = 300) in the same manner as the wild-type VPAC1 receptor. The motif responsible for discrimination was determined by introducing small blocks or individual amino acids of secretin receptor in the 123-144 sequence of the S123V chimera. The data obtained from 14 new chimeras sustained that two nonadjacent pairs of amino acids, Gln(135) Thr(136) and Gly(140) Ser(141) in the C-terminal end of the N-terminal VPAC1 receptor ectodomain constitute a selective filter that strongly restricts access of secretin to the VPAC1 receptor.",,
11511084,Hyperphosphorylation and association with RBP of the intracellular domain of Notch1.,"Although the intracellular domain of Notch1 is phosphorylated and it associates with members of the CSL family, the relationship of these events is poorly understood. Using in vivo [(32)P]orthophosphate labeling of cells expressing transfected Notch1, we observed that the furin cleaved Notch1 (TMIC) and the soluble intracellular forms (NICD), but not the full-length molecule were phosphorylated. Furthermore, transfected NICD molecules showed a significantly greater specific activity of phosphorylation, or hyperphosphorylation, compared to TMIC molecules. Hyperphosphorylation of NICD was also observed when NICD was generated by an endogenous intramembraneous cleavage of TMIC. However, TMIC molecules bearing a mutation that reduces intramembraneous cleavage (V1744K) did not show an enhanced incorporation of phosphate, suggesting that cleavage is required for hyperphosphorylation. Using deletion constructs to map the sites of phosphorylation, we observed that a domain of 93 amino acids downstream of the ankyrin repeats incorporated the majority of (32)P in vivo. This sequence was also required for activation of the HES-1 promoter. In addition, we observed that hyperphosphorylated forms of the intracellular domain were more likely to interact with the transcriptional coactivator RBP. However, dephosphorylation experiments showed that the interaction between RBP and the intracellular domain of Notch was not dependent upon Notch1IC phosphorylation. These studies reveal that phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor is a dynamic process during the events of Notch signal transduction.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2001
12944565,Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to loss of function of the KiSS1-derived peptide receptor GPR54.,"Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is defined as a deficiency of the pituitary secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, which results in the impairment of pubertal maturation and of reproductive function. In the absence of pituitary or hypothalamic anatomical lesions and of anosmia (Kallmann syndrome), hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). A limited number of IHH cases are due to loss-of-function mutations of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. To identify additional gene defects leading to IHH, a large consanguineous family with five affected siblings and with a normal gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor coding sequence was studied. Homozygosity whole-genome mapping allowed the localization of a new locus within the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13). Sequencing of several genes localized within this region showed that all affected siblings of the family carried a homozygous deletion of 155 nucleotides in the GPR54 gene. This deletion encompassed the splicing acceptor site of intron 4-exon 5 junction and part of exon 5. The deletion was absent or present on only one allele in unaffected family members. GPR54 has been initially identified as an orphan G protein-coupled receptor with 40% homology to galanin receptors. Recently, a 54-aa peptide derived from the KiSS1 protein was identified as a ligand of GPR54. The present study shows that loss of function of GPR54 is a cause of IHH, and it identifies GPR54 and possibly KiSS1 protein-derived peptide as playing a major and previously unsuspected role in the physiology of the gonadotropic axis.",,
10352278,ICAM-2 and a peptide from its binding domain are efficient activators of leukocyte adhesion and integrin affinity.,"Cell adhesion mediated by the CD11/CD18 integrins and their ligands, the ICAMs, is required for many leukocyte functions. In resting cells the integrins are nonadhesive, but when activated they become adhesive for their ligands. Previous findings have shown that a peptide derived from the first Ig domain of ICAM-2 (P1) binds to LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) and Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and activates leukocyte aggregation. Because its mechanism of action has remained poorly understood, we have now studied the peptide-induced ligand binding in detail. Here we show that P1 was able to induce CD11/CD18-dependent adhesion of human T lymphocytes to immobilized, purified ICAM-1, -2, and -3. The optimal peptide concentration was 150 micrograms/ml, whereas concentrations higher than 400 micrograms/ml did not have any stimulatory effect. The increase in adhesion was detectable within 10 min of treatment with the peptide; it was dependent on energy, divalent cations, temperature, and an intact cytoskeleton but was unaffected by protein kinase C and protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Peptide treatment resulted in strong stimulation of the binding of soluble, recombinant ICAMs to T lymphocytes, showing that the integrin affinity toward its ligands was increased. Importantly, soluble ICAM-2Fc was also able to induce T lymphocyte adhesion to purified ICAM-1, -2, and -3, and it was a more potent stimulatory molecule than ICAM-1Fc or ICAM-3Fc.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1999
12297674,Id: a target of BMP signaling.,"Cytokines of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily transduce their signals by activating receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads). Distinct R-Smads or combinations of R-Smads are activated by TGF-beta, activin, or bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). R-Smads activated by BMPs induce expression of Id proteins, which act as inhibitors of differentiation and stimulators of cell growth by inhibiting the function of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. In endothelial cells, TGF-beta binds to two distinct type I receptor serine-threonine kinases, ALK-5 and ALK-1; the latter activates the same R-Smads that are activated by BMP and induces synthesis of Id (inhibitor of differentiation or inhibitor of DNA binding) proteins. Growing evidence suggests that Id proteins may play crucial roles in angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and osteogenesis and act as key molecules in regulating biological responses induced by BMPs and TGF-beta.",Science's STKE : signal transduction knowledge environment,2002
14530218,Identification and characterisation of GPR100 as a novel human G-protein-coupled bradykinin receptor.,"G-protein-coupled receptor 100 (GPR100) was discovered by searching the human genome database for novel G-protein-coupled peptide receptors. Full-length GPR100 was amplified from a cDNA library of the neuroendocrine cell line BON, which is derived from a human pancreas carcinoid. The open-reading frame, present on a single exon, coded for a protein of 374 amino acids with highest sequence identity (43%) to the human orphan somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor. The analysis of chromosomal localisation mapped the GPR100 gene to chromosome 1q21.2-q21.3. The stable expression of GPR100 in Chinese hamster ovary cells together with aequorin as calcium sensor and the promiscuous G-protein subunit alpha16 as signal transducer revealed bradykinin and kallidin as effectors to elicit a calcium response. Dose-response curves yielded EC50 values for both ligands in the low nanomolar range, while the respective analogues without arginine at the carboxy-terminus were inactive. Calcium mobilisation was inhibited by the phospholipase C blocker U73122, but not by pertussis toxin, suggesting the involvement of the G-protein subunit alphaq and not alphai or alphao in signal transduction. In line with the main function of kinins as peripheral hormones, we found that GPR100 was expressed predominantly in tissues like pancreas, heart, skeletal muscle, salivary gland, bladder, kidney, liver, placenta, stomach, jejunum, thyroid gland, ovary, and bone marrow, but smaller amounts were also detected in the brain and in cell lines derived from tumours of various origins.",British journal of pharmacology,2003
11416225,Identification and characterization of a melanin-concentrating hormone receptor.,"Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), a neuropeptide expressed in central and peripheral nervous systems, plays an important role in the control of feeding behaviors and energy metabolism. An orphan G protein-coupled receptor (SLC-1/GPR24) has recently been identified as a receptor for MCH (MCHR1). We report here the identification and characterization of a G protein-coupled receptor as the MCH receptor subtype 2 (MCHR2). MCHR2 has higher protein sequence homology to MCHR1 than any other G protein-coupled receptor. The expression of MCHR2 has been detected in many regions of the brain. In contrast to MCHR1, which is intronless in the coding region and is located at the chromosomal locus 22q13.3, the MCHR2 gene has multiple exons and is mapped to locus 6q21. MCHR2 is specifically activated by nanomolar concentrations of MCH, binds to MCH with high affinity, and signals through Gq protein. This discovery is important for a full understanding of MCH biology and the development of potential therapeutics for diseases involving MCH, including obesity.",,
11470831,Identification and characterization of a novel extracellular matrix protein nephronectin that is associated with integrin alpha8beta1 in the embryonic kidney.,"The epithelial-mesenchymal interactions required for kidney organogenesis are disrupted in mice lacking the integrin alpha8beta1. None of this integrin's known ligands, however, appears to account for this phenotype. To identify a more relevant ligand, a soluble integrin alpha8beta1 heterodimer fused to alkaline phosphatase (AP) has been used to probe blots and cDNA libraries. In newborn mouse kidney extracts, alpha8beta1-AP detects a novel ligand of 70-90 kD. This protein, named nephronectin, is an extracellular matrix protein with five EGF-like repeats, a mucin region containing a RGD sequence, and a COOH-terminal MAM domain. Integrin alpha8beta1 and several additional RGD-binding integrins bind nephronectin. Nephronectin mRNA is expressed in the ureteric bud epithelium, whereas alpha8beta1 is expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme. Nephronectin is localized in the extracellular matrix in the same distribution as the ligand detected by alpha8beta1-AP and forms a complex with alpha8beta1 in vivo. Thus, these results strongly suggest that nephronectin is a relevant ligand mediating alpha8beta1 function in the kidney. Nephronectin is expressed at numerous sites outside the kidney, so it may also have wider roles in development. The approaches used here should be generally useful for characterizing the interactions of novel extracellular matrix proteins identified through genomic sequencing projects.",,
9125122,Identification and characterization of a novel human cortistatin-like peptide.,"Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that showed significant homology to rat cortistatin (CST) were found in a human fetal brain cDNA library. A protein coded by the cDNA showed 55% identity to rat preprocortistatin in amino acid. Similarly in the generation of mature peptides from rat preprocortistatin, it was expected that cleavage at dibasic amino acids in the C-terminal portion of the coded protein might produce at least two different sizes of mature peptides with 29 and 17 amino acid residues, respectively. We chemically synthesized the predicted mature peptide with 17 amino acid residues (hCS-17) and examined its biological activities. It bound to all human somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtypes in almost the same manner as rat CST-14. It also inhibited cAMP production induced by forskolin through SSTRs. Administration of hCS-17 to the cerebral ventricle showed flattening of cortical and hippocampal electroencephalograms in rats. These results indicate that a bioactive peptide encoded by the cDNA is a human counterpart corresponding to rat CST.",,
12714592,Identification and characterization of a novel RF-amide peptide ligand for orphan G-protein-coupled receptor SP9155.,"Orphan G-protein-coupled receptors are a large class of receptors whose cognate ligands are unknown. SP9155 (also referred to as AQ27 and GPR103) is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor originally cloned from a human brain cDNA library. SP9155 was found to be predominantly expressed in brain, heart, kidney, retina, and testis. Phylogenetic analysis shows that SP9155 shares high homology with Orexin, NPFF, and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors, but identification of the endogenous ligand for SP9155 has not been reported. In this study, we have used a novel method to predict peptides from genome data bases. From these predicted peptides, a novel RF-amide peptide, P52 was shown to selectively activate SP9155-transfected cells. We subsequently cloned the precursor gene of the P52 ligand and characterized the activity of other possible peptides encoded by the precursor. This revealed an extended peptide, P518, which exhibited high affinity for SP9155 (EC50 = 7 nm). mRNA expression analysis revealed that the peptide P518 precursor gene is predominantly expressed in various brain regions, coronary arteries, thyroid and parathyroid glands, large intestine, colon, bladder, testes, and prostate. These results indicate the existence of a novel RF-amide neuroendocrine peptide system, and suggest that SP9155 is likely the relevant G-protein-coupled receptor for this peptide.",,
16221874,"Identification and characterization of a potent, selective nonpeptide agonist of the CC chemokine receptor CCR8.","In this study, we report the first example of a nonpeptide chemokine receptor agonist, 2-{2-[4-(3-phenoxybenzyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethoxy}ethanol (ZK 756326), for the CC chemokine receptor CCR8. ZK 756326 inhibited the binding of the CCR8 ligand I-309 (CCL1), with an IC(50) value of 1.8 muM. Furthermore, ZK 756326 was a full agonist of CCR8, dose-responsively eliciting an increase in intracellular calcium and cross-desensitizing the response of the receptor to CCL1. In addition, ZK 756326 stimulated extracellular acidification in cells expressing human CCR8. The ability of ZK 756326 to induce a response was receptor-specific and mediated through Galpha(i), because it could be blocked by treatment with pertussis toxin. The CCR8 agonist activated cells expressing murine CCR8, eliciting their chemotaxis and inducing phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1/2. Like CCL1, ZK 756326 inhibited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) fusion of cells expressing CD4 and CCR8. Finally, unlike mCCL1, ZK 756326 bound to and activated a form of mCCR8 that was mutated to eliminate O-linked sulfation at tyrosines 14 and 15. Therefore, ZK 756326 is most probably not binding in the same manner as CCL1 but can activate the switch mechanism involved in transducing signaling events. In summary, we have identified a nonpeptide agonist of CCR8. This compound may be useful in evaluating the physiological role of CCR8 in HIV infection, as well as in the general study of CCR8 biology without the constraints inherent to the use of protein agonists such as its natural ligand.",,
11404457,"Identification and characterization of a second melanin-concentrating hormone receptor, MCH-2R.","Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a 19-aa cyclic neuropeptide originally isolated from chum salmon pituitaries. Besides its effects on the aggregation of melanophores in fish several lines of evidence suggest that in mammals MCH functions as a regulator of energy homeostasis. Recently, several groups reported the identification of an orphan G protein-coupled receptor as a receptor for MCH (MCH-1R). We hereby report the identification of a second human MCH receptor termed MCH-2R, which shares about 38% amino acid identity with MCH-1R. MCH-2R displayed high-affinity MCH binding, resulting in inositol phosphate turnover and release of intracellular calcium in mammalian cells. In contrast to MCH-1R, MCH-2R signaling is not sensitive to pertussis toxin and MCH-2R cannot reduce forskolin-stimulated cAMP production, suggesting an exclusive G(alpha)q coupling of the MCH-2R in cell-based systems. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of human and monkey tissue shows that expression of MCH-2R mRNA is restricted to several regions of the brain, including the arcuate nucleus and the ventral medial hypothalamus, areas implicated in regulation of body weight. In addition, the human MCH-2R gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6 at band 6q16.2-16.3, a region reported to be associated with cytogenetic abnormalities of obese patients. The characterization of a second mammalian G protein-coupled receptor for MCH potentially indicates that the control of energy homeostasis in mammals by the MCH neuropeptide system may be more complex than initially anticipated.",,
15623572,Identification and characterization of an endogenous chemotactic ligand specific for FPRL2.,"Chemotaxis of dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes is a key step in the initiation of an adequate immune response. Formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and FPR-like receptor (FPRL)1, two G protein-coupled receptors belonging to the FPR family, play an essential role in host defense mechanisms against bacterial infection and in the regulation of inflammatory reactions. FPRL2, the third member of this structural family of chemoattractant receptors, is characterized by its specific expression on monocytes and DCs. Here, we present the isolation from a spleen extract and the functional characterization of F2L, a novel chemoattractant peptide acting specifically through FPRL2. F2L is an acetylated amino-terminal peptide derived from the cleavage of the human heme-binding protein, an intracellular tetrapyrolle-binding protein. The peptide binds and activates FPRL2 in the low nanomolar range, which triggers intracellular calcium release, inhibition of cAMP accumulation, and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases through the G(i) class of heterotrimeric G proteins. When tested on monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs, F2L promotes calcium mobilization and chemotaxis. Therefore, F2L appears as a new natural chemoattractant peptide for DCs and monocytes, and the first potent and specific agonist of FPRL2.",,
9624164,Identification and characterization of small molecule functional antagonists of the CCR1 chemokine receptor.,"The CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed) have been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Since their effects are mediated through the CCR1 chemokine receptor, we set up a small molecule CCR1 antagonist program to search for inhibitors. Through high capacity screening we discovered a number of 4-hydroxypiperidine compounds with CCR1 antagonist activity and report their synthesis and in vitro pharmacology here. Scatchard analysis of the competition binding data revealed that the compounds had Ki values ranging from 40 to 4000 nM. The pharmacological profile of the most potent member of this series, compound 1 (2-2-diphenyl-5-(4-chlorophenyl)piperidin-lyl)valeronitri te), was further evaluated. Compound 1 showed concentration-dependent inhibition of MIP-1alpha-induced extracellular acidification and Ca2+ mobilization demonstrating functional antagonism. When given alone, the compound did not elicit any responses, indicating the absence of intrinsic agonist activity. Compound 1 inhibited MIP-1alpha- and RANTES-induced migration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a dose-responsive manner. Selectivity testing against a panel of seven transmembrane domain receptors indicated that compound 1 is inactive on a number of receptors at concentrations up to 10 microM. This is the first description of CCR1 receptor antagonists that may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases involving MIP-1alpha, RANTES, and CCR1.",,
9551924,"Identification and characterization of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor in human T cell lines: ligand binding, biological activity, and HIV-1 infectivity.","The CXCR4 chemokine receptor has been shown to respond to the C-X-C chemokine stromal-derived factor (SDF-1) and has recently been shown to be an important coreceptor for HIV-1 infection. In the present paper we have tested a number of human lymphocyte cell lines, including Jurkat, HUT78, CEM, and Sup-T1 for the presence of CXCR4 receptors. We found that these T cell lines bind SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta with high affinity. The CXCR4 Ab 12G5 inhibited both SDF-1 binding and HIV-1LAI-mediated fusion of CEM. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of approximately 150,000 SDF-1alpha-binding sites per cell with a Kd between 5 and 10 nM. Cross-competition experiments using unlabeled SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta revealed that both chemokines are equally capable of displacing their radiolabeled counterparts. Internalization studies with [125]I-SDF-1alpha revealed that Jurkat cells internalized greater than 90% of the ligand by 2 h at 37 degrees C. SDF-1alpha was also chemotactic for Jurkat cells and caused an increase in the rate of extracellular acidification that was half-maximal at 18 nM SDF-1alpha and could be inhibited by pretreatment with the SDF-1 proteins, pertussis toxin, or the Ab 12G5. Finally, SDF-1alpha also caused an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in Sup-T1 cells that was abolished by preincubating the cells with pertussis toxin or PMA and inhibited by the Ab 12G5. This molecular characterization of CXCR4 receptors should prove useful in clarifying receptor interaction with SDF-1 proteins and with HIV-1 glycoprotein, with the ultimate aim of targeting the viral interaction for therapeutic intervention.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1998
11861531,Identification and characterization of the murine and human gene encoding the tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues.,"By screening public databases, we identified human and mouse genomic DNA clones that encode the tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39). The TIP39 precursor is encoded by at least three exons; a noncoding exon U1, exon 1 encoding residues -61 (initiator methionine) to -19 of the leader sequence, and exon 2 encoding residues -18 to -1 and residues +1 to +39. Secreted human TIP39 is identical to the previously isolated bovine TIP39, whereas mouse TIP39 differs by four amino acids. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that TIP39, PTH, and PTHrP may have evolved from a common ancestor. Synthetic human and mouse TIP39 showed indistinguishable potencies [EC(50): 0.54 (human) vs. 0.74 nM (mouse)] at the human PTH2-receptor stably expressed in LLCPK(1) cells; furthermore, TIP-(9-39) was an inhibitor of cAMP accumulation stimulated by either [Tyr(34)]PTH(1-34)amide or human/bovine TIP39. In the mouse, an approximately 4.5-kb mRNA encoding TIP39 was identified by Northern blot analysis in testis and, less abundantly, in liver and kidney, whereas other tissues revealed additional smaller transcripts. In situ hybridizations revealed TIP39 expression in seminiferous tubuli and several brain regions, including nucleus ruber, nucleus centralis pontis, and nucleus subparafascicularis thalami. Because PTH2 receptor expression was previously shown to be highest in brain, pancreas, and testis, our findings are consistent with the notion that TIP39 is a neuropeptide which may also have a role in spermatogenesis.",Endocrinology,2002
11024015,Identification and characterization of two G protein-coupled receptors for neuropeptide FF.,"The central nervous system octapeptide, neuropeptide FF (NPFF), is believed to play a role in pain modulation and opiate tolerance. Two G protein-coupled receptors, NPFF1 and NPFF2, were isolated from human and rat central nervous system tissues. NPFF specifically bound to NPFF1 (K(d) = 1.13 nm) and NPFF2 (K(d) = 0.37 nm), and both receptors were activated by NPFF in a variety of heterologous expression systems. The localization of mRNA and binding sites of these receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the lateral hypothalamus, the spinal trigeminal nuclei, and the thalamic nuclei supports a role for NPFF in pain modulation. Among the receptors with the highest amino acid sequence homology to NPFF1 and NPFF2 are members of the orexin, NPY, and cholecystokinin families, which have been implicated in feeding. These similarities together with the finding that BIBP3226, an anorexigenic Y1 receptor ligand, also binds to NPFF1 suggest a potential role for NPFF1 in feeding. The identification of NPFF1 and NPFF2 will help delineate their roles in these and other physiological functions.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000

Binding sites for neuromedin U have been characterized in rat uterus, however, little is known about the activity of this peptide in the regions of the central nervous system where it is expressed. The receptors characterized in this report are activated by neuromedin U at nanomolar potency in heterologous expression systems and bind radiolabeled neuromedin U with high affinity. Localization of the receptor RNA by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in a variety of human tissues shows distinct expression patterns for the two receptors.

We report here the characterization and molecular cloning of a distinct murine IL-15R alpha chain. IL-15R alpha alone displays an affinity of binding for IL-15 equivalent to that of the heterotrimeric IL-2R for IL-2. A biologically functional heteromeric IL-15 receptor complex capable of mediating IL-15 responses was generated through reconstruction experiments in a murine myeloid cell line. IL-15R alpha is structurally similar to IL-2R alpha; together they define a new cytokine receptor family.

11590190,"Identification and comparison of residues critical for cell-adhesion activities of two neutrophil CD66 antigens, CEACAM6 and CEACAM8.","CEACAM6 (CD66c) and CEACAM8 (CD66b) are cell-adhesion proteins on neutrophils that belong to the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family. CEACAM6 reveals homophilic adhesion and heterophilic adhesion to other CEACAM family antigens including CEACAM8, CEACAM1, and CEA, whereas CEACAM8 exhibits only heterophilic adhesion to CEACAM6. Here, we investigated and compared structural requirements for the homophilic adhesion of CEACAM6 and heterophilic adhesion between CEACAM6 and CEACAM8 at the amino acid level by using CHO transfectants expressing their mutant and chimeric proteins. The NH(2)-terminal domain (N-domain) of CEACAM6 expressed on a CHO cell was suggested to bind the N-domain of CEACAM6 or CEACAM8 on the opposing cell. By homologue-scanning mutagenesis, we found that the locations of the sequences critical for the adhesion of CEACAM6 to itself and to CEACAM8 are overlapped and that they are highly similar but not identical to the locations of the residues previously shown to be essential for the binding of CEACAM antigens to Opa proteins of pathogenic NEISSERIAE: Our findings imply that subtle differences in the N-domain sequences determine the specificity of the CEACAM antigens on neutrophils for interaction with the same or different CEACAM antigens and the bacterial proteins.",Journal of leukocyte biology,2001
10887190,Identification and functional characterization of a novel subtype of neuromedin U receptor.,"Neuromedin U is a bioactive peptide isolated originally from the porcine spinal cord. We recently identified neuromedin U as the cognate ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor FM-3. In this study, we isolated cDNA coding for a novel G protein-coupled receptor, TGR-1, which was highly homologous with FM-3. We found that neuromedin U specifically and clearly elevated the extracellular acidification rates, arachidonic acid metabolite release, and intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing TGR-1. Radiolabeled neuromedin U specifically bound with high affinity to membrane fractions prepared from these cells. These results show that TGR-1, like FM-3, is a specific and functional receptor for neuromedin U. We analyzed TGR-1 mRNA tissue distribution in rats using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and found it to considerably differ from that of FM-3 mRNA. TGR-1 mRNA was primarily expressed in the uterus, suggesting that TGR-1 mediates the contractile activity of neuromedin U in this tissue. The identification of specific and functional receptor subtypes for neuromedin U will facilitate the study of their physiological roles and the search for their specific agonists and antagonists.",,
9312047,Identification and functional characterization of a second chain of the interleukin-10 receptor complex.,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine which signals through a specific cell surface receptor complex. Only one chain, that for ligand binding (IL-10Ralpha or IL-10R1), was identified previously. We report here that, although human IL-10 binds to the human IL-10R1 chain expressed in hamster cells, it does not induce signal transduction. However, the co-expression of CRFB4, a transmembrane protein of previously unknown function belonging to the class II cytokine receptor family, together with the IL-10R1 chain renders hamster cells sensitive to IL-10. The IL-10:CRFB4 complex was detected by cross-linking to labeled IL-10. In addition, the IL-10R1 chain was able to be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-CRF antibody when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with IL-10. These results demonstrate that the CRFB4 chain is part of the IL-10 receptor signaling complex. Thus, the CRFB4 chain, which we designate as the IL-10R2 or IL-10Rbeta chain, serves as an accessory chain essential for the active IL-10 receptor complex and to initiate IL-10-induced signal transduction events.",,

9390561,"Identification and molecular characterization of fractalkine receptor CX3CR1, which mediates both leukocyte migration and adhesion.","Leukocyte trafficking at the endothelium requires both cellular adhesion molecules and chemotactic factors. Fractalkine, a novel transmembrane molecule with a CX3C-motif chemokine domain atop a mucin stalk, induces both adhesion and migration of leukocytes. Here we identify a seven-transmembrane high-affinity receptor for fractalkine and show that it mediates both the adhesive and migratory functions of fractalkine. The receptor, now termed CX3CR1, requires pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein signaling to induce migration but not to support adhesion, which also occurs without other adhesion molecules but requires the architecture of a chemokine domain atop the mucin stalk. Natural killer cells predominantly express CX3CR1 and respond to fractalkine in both migration and adhesion. Thus, fractalkine and CX3CR1 represent new types of leukocyte trafficking regulators, performing both adhesive and chemotactic functions.",,

Prokineticin 1 has also been shown to promote angiogenesis by stimulating proliferation, migration, and fenestration of endocrine organ-derived endothelial cells. Here we report the cloning and characterization of two closely related G protein-coupled receptors as receptors for prokineticins. Expression of prokineticin receptors in heterologous systems shows that these receptors bind to and are activated by nanomolar concentrations of recombinant prokineticins. Activation of prokineticin receptors leads to mobilization of calcium, stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover, and activation of p44/p42 MAPK signaling pathways that are consistent with the effects of prokineticins on smooth muscle contraction and angiogenesis. mRNA expression analysis reveals that prokineticin receptors are expressed in gastrointestinal organs, endocrine glands, and other tissues.",,

Interestingly, TRAIL receptor-2 but not TRAIL receptor-3 contains a cytoplasmic ""death domain"" necessary for induction of apoptosis and is hence designated death receptor-5 (DR5). Like DR4, DR5 engages the apoptotic pathway independent of the adaptor molecule FADD/MORT1. Because of its lack of a death domain, TRAIL receptor-3 is not capable of inducing apoptosis. However, by competing for TRAIL, it is capable of inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Thus, TRAIL receptor-3 may function as an antagonistic decoy receptor to attenuate the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL in most tissues that are TRAIL+, DR4+, and DR5+.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
15772293,Identification and pharmacological characterization of prokineticin 2 beta as a selective ligand for prokineticin receptor 1.,"Prokineticins 1 and 2 (PK1 and PK2) have been recently identified from humans and other mammals and play multiple functional roles. PK proteins are ligands for two G protein-coupled receptors, PK receptor 1 (PKR1) and PK receptor 2 (PKR2). Here, we report the molecular cloning and pharmacological characterization of an alternatively spliced product of the PK2 gene encoding 21 additional amino acids compared with PK2, designated PK2L (for PK2 long form). PK2L mRNA is broadly expressed, as is PK2. However, PK2L mRNA expression is lower in brain, undetectable in kidney, and much higher in lung and spleen than that of PK2. We expressed PK2L in mammalian cells and characterized the resulting peptide in comparison with PK1 and PK2. Biochemical characterization indicates that secreted PK2L protein is processed into a smaller peptide by proteolytic cleavage. We designate this smaller form of peptide as PK2beta. Coexpression of furin with PK2L significantly increased the PK2beta processing efficiency. Functional studies showed that PK1, PK2, and PK2beta stimulate intracellular Ca(2+) responses in PKR1-expressing cells with similar potencies. However, the PK2beta stimulus of Ca(2+) responses in PKR2-expressing cells is at least 10-fold less potent than that of PK1 or PK2. Differences in receptor selectivity combined with differential tissue expression patterns suggest PK2 and PK2beta might have different functions in vivo. PKRs have been reported to couple to G(q) and G(i) proteins. In this report, we show that PKs not only stimulate Ca(2+) mobilization but also induce cAMP accumulation in PKR-expressing cells.",Molecular pharmacology,2005
2558309,Identification of a cDNA encoding a long form of prolactin receptor in human hepatoma and breast cancer cells.,"Human PRL receptor cDNA clones from hepatoma (Hep G2) and breast cancer (T-47D) libraries were isolated by using a rat PRL receptor cDNA probe. The nucleotide sequence predicts a mature protein of 598 amino acids with a much longer cytoplasmic domain than the rat liver PRL receptor. Although this extended region has additional segments of localized sequence identity with the human GH receptor, there is no identity with any consensus sequences known to be involved in hormonal signal transduction. This cDNA will be a valuable tool to better understand the role of PRL in the development and growth of human breast cancer.",,
23958951,Identification of a cellular ligand for the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp44.,"With an array of activating and inhibitory receptors, natural killer (NK) cells are involved in the eradication of infected, transformed, and tumor cells. NKp44 is a member of the natural cytotoxicity receptor family, which is exclusively expressed on activated NK cells. Here, we identify natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp44 (NKp44L), a novel isoform of the mixed-lineage leukemia-5 protein, as a cellular ligand for NKp44. Unlike the other MLL family members, NKp44L is excluded from the nucleus, but expressed at the cell-surface level; its subcellular localization is being associated with the presence of a specific C-terminal motif. Strikingly, NKp44L has not been detected on circulating cells isolated from healthy individuals, but it is expressed on a large panel of the tumor and transformed cells. The sharply decreased NK lysis activity induced by anti-NKp44L antibodies directly demonstrates the role of NKp44L in cytotoxicity. Taken together, these results show that NKp44L could be critical for NK cell-mediated innate immunity. The identification and cellular distribution of NKp44L highlight the role of this self-molecule as a danger signal to alert the NK cell network.",,
12947048,Identification of a contact site for residue 19 of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein analogs in transmembrane domain two of the type 1 PTH receptor.,"Recent functional studies have suggested that position 19 in PTH interacts with the portion of the PTH-1 receptor (P1R) that contains the extracellular loops and seven transmembrance helices (TMs) (the J domain). We tested this hypothesis using the photoaffinity cross-linking approach. A PTHrP(1-36) analog and a conformationally constrained PTH(1-21) analog, each containing para-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) at position 19, each cross-linked efficiently to the P1R expressed in COS-7 cells, and digestive mapping analysis localized the cross-linked site to the interval (Leu232-Lys240) at the extracellular end of TM2. Point mutation analysis identified Ala234, Val235, and Lys240 as determinants of cross-linking efficiency, and the Lys240-->Ala mutation selectively impaired the binding of PTH(1-21) and PTH(1-19) analogs, relative to that of PTH(1-15) analogs. The findings support the hypothesis that residue 19 of the receptor-bound ligand contacts, or is close to, the P1R J domain-specifically, Lys240 at the extracellular end of TM2. The findings also support a molecular model in which the 1-21 region of PTH binds to the extracellular face of the P1R J domain as an alpha-helix.",,
11555649,Identification of a heregulin binding site in HER3 extracellular domain.,"HER3 (also known as c-Erb-b3) is a type I receptor tyrosine kinase similar in sequence to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. The extracellular segment of this transmembrane receptor contains four domains. Domains I and II are similar in sequence to domains III and IV, respectively, and domains II and IV are cysteine-rich. We show that the EGF-like domain of heregulin (hrg) binds to domains I and II of HER3, in contrast to the EGF receptor, for which prior studies have shown that a construct consisting of domains III and portions of domain IV binds EGF. Next, we identified a putative hrg binding site by limited proteolysis of the recombinant extracellular domains of HER3 (HER3-ECD(I-IV)) in both the presence and absence of hrg. In the absence of hrg, HER3-ECD(I-IV) is cleaved after position Tyr(50), near the beginning of domain I. Binding of hrg to HER3-ECD(I-IV) fully protects position Tyr(50) from proteolysis. To confirm that domain I contains a hrg binding site, we expressed domains I and II (HER3-ECD(I-II)) and find that it binds hrg with 68 nm affinity. These data suggest that domains I and II of HER3-ECD(I-IV) act as a functional unit in folding and binding of hrg. Thus, our biochemical findings reinforce the structural hypothesis of others that HER3-ECD(I-IV) is similar to the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), as follows: 1) The protected cleavage site in HER3-ECD(I-IV) corresponds to a binding footprint in domain I of IGF-1R; 2) HER3-ECD(I-II) binds hrg with a 68 nm dissociation constant, supporting the hypothesis that domain I is involved in ligand binding; and 3) the large accessible surface area (1749 A) of domain L1 of IGF-1R that is buried by domain S1, as well as the presence of conserved contacts in this interface of type 1 RTKs, suggests that domains L1 and S1 of IGF-1R function as a unit as observed for HER3-ECD(I-II). Our results are consistent with the proposal that HER3 has a structure similar to IGF-1R and binds ligand at a site in corresponding domains.",,
7673243,Identification of a human type II receptor for bone morphogenetic protein-4 that forms differential heteromeric complexes with bone morphogenetic protein type I receptors.,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) comprise the largest subfamily of TGF-beta-related ligands and are known to bind to type I and type II receptor serine/threonine kinases. Although several mammalian BMP type I receptors have been identified, the mammalian BMP type II receptors have remained elusive. We have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel transmembrane serine/threonine kinase from human skin fibroblasts which we demonstrate here to be a type II receptor that binds BMP-4. This receptor (BRK-3) is distantly related to other known type II receptors and is distinguished from them by an extremely long carboxyl-terminal sequence following the intracellular kinase domain. The BRK-3 gene is widely expressed in a variety of adult tissues. When expressed alone in COS cells, BRK-3 specifically binds BMP-4, but cross-linking of BMP-4 to BRK-3 is undetectable in the absence of either the BRK-1 or BRK-2 BMP type I receptors. Cotransfection of BRK-2 with BRK-3 greatly enhanced affinity labeling of BMP-4 to the type I receptor, in contrast to the affinity labeling pattern observed with the BRK-1 + BRK-3 heteromeric complex. Furthermore, a subpopulation of super-high affinity binding sites is formed in COS cells upon cotransfection only of BRK-2 + BRK-3, suggesting that the different heteromeric BMP receptor complexes have different signaling potential.",,
12118011,Identification of a neuropeptide modified with bromine as an endogenous ligand for GPR7.,"We isolated a novel gene in a search of the Celera data base and found that it encoded a peptidic ligand for a G protein-coupled receptor, GPR7 (O'Dowd, B. F., Scheideler, M. A., Nguyen, T., Cheng, R., Rasmussen, J. S., Marchese, A., Zastawny, R., Heng, H. H., Tsui, L. C., Shi, X., Asa, S., Puy, L., and George, S. R. (1995) Genomics 28, 84-91; Lee, D. K., Nguyen, T., Porter, C. A., Cheng, R., George, S. R., and O'Dowd, B. F. (1999) Mol. Brain Res. 71, 96-103). The expression of this gene was detected in various tissues in rats, including the lymphoid organs, central nervous system, mammary glands, and uterus. GPR7 mRNA was mainly detected in the central nervous system and uterus. In situ hybridization showed that the gene encoding the GPR7 ligand was expressed in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of rats. To determine the molecular structure of the endogenous GPR7 ligand, we purified it from bovine hypothalamic tissue extracts on the basis of cAMP production-inhibitory activity to cells expressing GPR7. Through structural analyses, we found that the purified endogenous ligand was a peptide with 29 amino acid residues and that it was uniquely modified with bromine. We subsequently determined that the C-6 position of the indole moiety in the N-terminal Trp was brominated. We believe this is the first report on a neuropeptide modified with bromine and have hence named it neuropeptide B. In in vitro assays, bromination did not influence the binding of neuropeptide B to the receptor.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
11418238,"Identification of a new fibroblast growth factor receptor, FGFR5.","A novel fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), designated FGFR5, was identified from an EST database of a murine lymph node stromal cell cDNA library. The EST has approximately 32% identity to the extracellular domain of FGFR1-4. Library screening with this EST identified two full-length alternative transcripts which we designated as FGFR5 beta and FGFR5 gamma. The main difference between these transcripts is that FGFR5 beta contains three extracellular Ig domains whereas FGFR5 gamma contains only two. A unique feature of FGFR5 is that it does not contain an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Predictive structural modelling of the extracellular domain of FGFR5 gamma suggested that it was a member of the I-set subgroup of the Ig-superfamily, consistent with the known FGFRs. Northern analysis of mouse and human FGFR5 showed detectable mRNA in a broad range of tissues, including kidney, brain and lung. Genomic sequencing identified four introns but identified no alternative transcripts containing a tyrosine kinase domain. Extracellular regions of FGFR5 beta and 5 gamma were cloned in-frame with the Fc fragment of human IgG(1) to generate recombinant non-membrane bound protein. Recombinant FGFR5 beta Fc and R5 gamma Fc demonstrated specific binding to the ligand FGF-2, but not FGF-7 or EGF. However, biological data suggest that FGF-2 binding to these proteins is with lower affinity than its cognate receptor FGFR2C. The above data indicate that this receptor should be considered as the fifth member of the FGFR family.",Gene,2001
10074428,"Identification of a new member of the tumor necrosis factor family and its receptor, a human ortholog of mouse GITR.","The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.",Current biology : CB,1999
10037686,Identification of a novel activation-inducible protein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and its ligand.,"Among members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, 4-1BB, CD27, and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor family-related gene (GITR) share a striking homology in the cytoplasmic domain. Here we report the identification of a new member, activation-inducible TNFR family member (AITR), which belongs to this subfamily, and its ligand. The receptor is expressed in lymph node and peripheral blood leukocytes, and its expression is up-regulated in human peripheral mononuclear cells mainly after stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin. AITR associates with TRAF1 (TNF receptor-associated factor 1), TRAF2, and TRAF3, and induces nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation via TRAF2. The ligand for AITR (AITRL) was found to be an undescribed member of the TNF family, which is expressed in endothelial cells. Thus, AITR and AITRL seem to be important for interactions between activated T lymphocytes and endothelial cells.",,
8663002,Identification of a novel binding site to the integrin alphaIIbbeta3 located in the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of human plasma fibronectin.,"Fibronectin has been shown to bind to integrin alphaIIbbeta3 in Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-dependent and -independent manners. A recent study has indicated that a 29-kDa dispase-digestive fragment from the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of human plasma fibronectin (lacking RGD sequence) inhibits binding of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets and ADP-induced aggregation (Tanabe, J. , Fujita, H., Iwamatsu, A., Mohri, H., and Ohkubo, T.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 27143-27147). We provide here the evidence that a peptide corresponding to residues from Ala1704 to Glu1718 (designated F1) from this fragment inhibited binding of 125I-labeled 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets and ADP-induced aggregation. The F1 peptide bound directly to alphaIIbbeta3 integrin receptor. These results indicate that a novel binding site in the C-terminal heparin-binding region of fibronectin is localized within the residues from Ala1704 to Glu1718. Binding of 125I-labeled 29-kDa fragment of fibronectin to thrombin-stimulated platelets was not inhibited by RGDS peptide and the 12-residue peptide from the cell-binding domain of fibronectin, suggesting that binding site in the C-terminal heparin-binding domain may be different from those of RGDS and the 12-residue peptide. This additional alphaIIbbeta3-binding domain(s) in fibronectin may also play some role for prevention of thrombus formation by direct interaction with alphaIIbbeta3.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
10781587,"Identification of a novel chemokine (CCL28), which binds CCR10 (GPR2).","We report the identification and characterization of a novel CC chemokine designated CCL28 and its receptor CCR10, known previously as orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR2. Human and mouse CCL28 share 83% identity at the amino acid and 76% at the nucleic acid levels. We also identified the mouse homologues of CCL28 and of CCR10, which map to mouse chromosomes 13 and 11, respectively. CCL28 is expressed in a variety of human and mouse tissues, and it appears to be predominantly produced by epithelial cells. Both human and mouse CCL28 induce calcium mobilization in human and mouse CCR10-expressing transfectants. CCL28 desensitized the calcium mobilization induced in CCR10 transfectants by CCL27, indicating that these chemokines share this new chemokine receptor. In vitro, recombinant human CCL28 displays chemotactic activity for resting CD4 or CD8 T cells.",,
8824284,Identification of a novel hypothalamic neuropeptide Y receptor associated with feeding behavior.,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) plays important roles in the central control of appetite and energy balance, but the receptor subtype responsible for this function has not been cloned. Here we report the cloning by expression of a novel NPY receptor subtype from a rat hypothalamus cDNA library. The novel receptor, referred to as the NPY Y5 receptor, has a transcript of approximately 2.6 kilobases with an open reading frame of 1335 base pairs that encodes a 445-amino acid protein. The amino acid sequence deduced from the rat Y5 cDNA clone shows only 30-33% identity to other NPY receptors, including Y1, Y2, and Y4/PP1. Using the rat Y5 receptor cDNA probe, the human homologue was obtained by low stringency hybridization. The human Y5 amino acid sequence has 88% identity to the rat Y5 receptor. Importantly, pharmacological analysis shows that the rat and human Y5 receptors have high affinity for the peptides that elicit feeding (e.g. NPY, PYY, (2-36)NPY, and (LP)NPY) and low affinity for nonstimulating peptides (e.g. (13-36)NPY and rat PP), suggesting that it is the NPY feeding receptor subtype.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
12736251,"Identification of a novel integrin alphaMbeta2 binding site in CCN1 (CYR61), a matricellular protein expressed in healing wounds and atherosclerotic lesions.","CCN1 (cysteine-rich 61) and CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor) are growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene products found in atherosclerotic lesions, restenosed blood vessels, and healing cutaneous wounds. Both CCN proteins have been shown to support cell adhesion and induce cell migration through interaction with integrin receptors. Recently, we have identified integrin alphaMbeta2 as the major adhesion receptor mediating monocyte adhesion to CCN1 and CCN2 and have shown that the alphaMI domain binds specifically to both proteins. In the present study, we demonstrated that activated monocytes adhered to a synthetic peptide (CCN1-H2, SSVKKYRPKYCGS) derived from a conserved region within the CCN1 C-terminal domain, and this process was blocked by the anti-alphaM monoclonal antibody 2LPM19c. Consistently, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the alphaMI domain (GST-alphaMI) bound to immobilized CCN1-H2 as well as to the corresponding H2 sequence in CCN2 (CCN2-H2, TSVKTYRAKFCGV). By contrast, a scrambled CCN1-H2 peptide and an 18-residue peptide derived from an adjacent sequence of CCN1-H2 failed to support monocyte adhesion or alphaMI domain binding. To confirm that the CCN1-H2 sequence within the CCN1 protein mediates alphaMbeta2 interaction, we developed an anti-peptide antibody against CCN1-H2 and showed that it specifically blocked GST-alphaMI binding to intact CCN1. Collectively, these results identify the H2 sequence in CCN1 and CCN2 as a novel integrin alphaMbeta2 binding motif that bears no apparent homology to any alphaMbeta2 binding sequence reported to date.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
17942747,Identification of a novel ligand binding residue Arg38(1.35) in the human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor.,"Delineation of peptide ligand binding sites is of fundamental importance in rational drug design and in understanding ligand-induced receptor activation. Molecular modeling and ligand docking to previously experimentally identified binding sites revealed a putative novel interaction between the C terminus of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and Arg(38(1.35)), located at the extracellular end of transmembrane domain 1 of the human GnRH receptor. Mutation of Arg(38(1.35)) to alanine resulted in 989- and 1268-fold reduction in affinity for GnRH I and GnRH II, respectively, the two endogenous ligands. Conservative mutation of Arg(38(1.35)) to lysine had less effect, giving reduced affinities of GnRH I and GnRH II by 24- and 54-fold, respectively. To test whether Arg(38(1.35)) interacts with the C-terminal Gly(10)-NH(2) of GnRH, binding of GnRH analogs with substitution of the C-terminal glycinamide with ethylamide ([Pro(9)-NHEt]GnRH) was studied with wild-type and Arg(38(1.35)) mutant receptors. Mutation of Arg(38(1.35)) to lysine or alanine had much smaller effect on receptor affinity for [Pro(9)-NHEt]GnRH analogs and no effect on binding affinity of peptide antagonist cetrorelix. In parallel with the decreased affinity, the mutants also gave a decreased potency to GnRH-elicited inositol phosphate (IP) responses. The mutant receptors had effects on [Pro(9)-NHEt]GnRH-elicited IP responses similar to that of the parent GnRHs. These findings indicate that Arg(38(1.35)) of the GnRH receptor is essential for high-affinity binding of GnRH agonists and stabilizing the receptor active conformation. The mutagenesis results support the prediction of molecular modeling that Arg(38(1.35)) interacts with the C-terminal glycinamide and probably forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl of Pro(9) and Gly(10)-NH(2).",,
11201742,Identification of a receptor mediating Nogo-66 inhibition of axonal regeneration.,"Nogo has been identified as a component of the central nervous system (CNS) myelin that prevents axonal regeneration in the adult vertebrate CNS. Analysis of Nogo-A has shown that an axon-inhibiting domain of 66 amino acids is expressed at the extracellular surface and at the endoplasmic reticulum lumen of transfected cells and oligodendrocytes. The acidic amino terminus of Nogo-A is detected at the cytosolic face of cellular membranes and may contribute to inhibition of axon regeneration at sites of oligodendrocyte injury. Here we show that the extracellular domain of Nogo (Nogo-66) inhibits axonal extension, but does not alter non-neuronal cell morphology. In contrast, a multivalent form of the N terminus of Nogo-A affects the morphology of both neurons and other cell types. Here we identify a brain-specific, leucine-rich-repeat protein with high affinity for soluble Nogo-66. Cleavage of the Nogo-66 receptor and other glycophosphatidylinositol-linked proteins from axonal surfaces renders neurons insensitive to Nogo-66. Nogo-66 receptor expression is sufficient to impart Nogo-66 axonal inhibition to unresponsive neurons. Disruption of the interaction between Nogo-66 and its receptor provides the potential for enhanced recovery after human CNS injury.",,
11342658,Identification of a selective nonpeptide antagonist of the anaphylatoxin C3a receptor that demonstrates antiinflammatory activity in animal models.,"The anaphylatoxin C3a is a potent chemotactic peptide and inflammatory mediator released during complement activation which binds to and activates a G-protein-coupled receptor. Molecular cloning of the C3aR has facilitated studies to identify nonpeptide antagonists of the C3aR. A chemical lead that selectively inhibited the C3aR in a high throughput screen was identified and chemically optimized. The resulting antagonist, N(2)-[(2,2-diphenylethoxy)acetyl]-L-arginine (SB 290157), functioned as a competitive antagonist of (125)I-C3a radioligand binding to rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells expressing the human C3aR (RBL-C3aR), with an IC(50) of 200 nM. SB 290157 was a functional antagonist, blocking C3a-induced C3aR internalization in a concentration-dependent manner and C3a-induced Ca(2+) mobilization in RBL-C3aR cells and human neutrophils with IC(50)s of 27.7 and 28 nM, respectively. SB 290157 was selective for the C3aR in that it did not antagonize the C5aR or six other chemotactic G protein-coupled receptors. Functional antagonism was not solely limited to the human C3aR; SB 290157 also inhibited C3a-induced Ca(2+) mobilization of RBL-2H3 cells expressing the mouse and guinea pig C3aRS: It potently inhibited C3a-mediated ATP release from guinea pig platelets and inhibited C3a-induced potentiation of the contractile response to field stimulation of perfused rat caudal artery. Furthermore, in animal models, SB 290157, inhibited neutrophil recruitment in a guinea pig LPS-induced airway neutrophilia model and decreased paw edema in a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model. This selective antagonist may be useful to define the physiological and pathophysiological roles of the C3aR.",,
14514671,Identification of a surface for binding to the GDNF-GFR alpha 1 complex in the first cadherin-like domain of RET.,"The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is activated by binding to a ligand complex formed by a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of neurotrophic factors bound to its cognate GDNF-family receptor-alpha (GFR alpha) glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked co-receptor. Molecular modeling studies of the extracellular domain of RET (RETECD) have revealed the existence of four cadherin-like domains (CLD1-4) followed by a cysteine-rich domain. Cross-linking experiments have indicated that the RETECD makes direct contacts with both the GDNF ligand and GFR alpha 1 molecule in the complex, although it has low or no detectable affinity for either component alone. We have exploited sequence and functional divergences between the ectodomains of mammalian and amphibian RET molecules to map binding determinants in the human RETECD responsible for its interaction with the GDNF-GFR alpha 1 complex by homologue-scanning mutagenesis. We found that Xenopus RETECD was unable to bind to GDNF-GFR alpha-1 or neurturin (NTN)-GFR alpha-2 complexes of mammalian origin. However, a chimeric molecule containing CLD1, -2, and -3 from human RETECD, but neither domain alone, had similar binding activity as compared with wild type human RETECD, suggesting the existence of an extended ligand binding surface within the three N-terminal cadherin-like domains of human RETECD. Subsequent loss-of-function experiments at higher resolution identified three small subsets of residues, mapping on the same face of the molecular model of RET CLD1, that were required for the interaction of human RETECD with the GDNF-GFR alpha 1 complex. Additional experiments demonstrated that N-linked glycosylation of human RETECD was not required for ligand binding. Based on these observations, we propose a model for the assembly and architecture of the GDNF-GFR alpha 1-RET complex.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
11734558,"Identification of amino acid residues critical for LD78beta, a variant of human macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, binding to CCR5 and inhibition of R5 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication.","In an attempt to determine which amino acid(s) of LD78beta, a variant of human macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, plays a critical role in the interaction with CCR5, we generated six LD78beta variants with an amino acid substituted to Ala at the NH(2) terminus of LD78beta. There was no significant difference in eliciting Ca(2+) flux and chemotaxis among the variants with the exception of LD78beta(T9A) showing a substantially reduced activity. The comparative order for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication inhibition was: LD78beta(P8A) > LD78beta(D6A) > LD78beta(WT), LD78beta(L3A) > LD78beta(T7A), LD78beta(P2A) > LD78beta(T9A). In binding inhibition assays of LD78beta variants using 2D7 monoclonal antibody and (125)I-labeled macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, the comparative order was: LD78beta(P8A), LD78beta(D6A) > LD78beta(WT) > LD78beta(L3A) > LD78beta(T7A) > LD78beta(T9A), LD78betaP2A). The order for CCR5 down-regulation induction was comparable to that for binding inhibition. The present data suggest that Pro-2, Asp-6, Pro-8, and Thr-9 are critical for LD78beta binding to CCR5 and HIV-1 replication inhibition, and that LD78beta binding to CCR5, regardless of affinity, is sufficient for the initial signal transduction of LD78beta, whereas the greater anti-HIV-1 activity requires the greater magnitude of binding. The data also suggest that LD78beta variants with appropriate amino acid substitution(s) such as LD78beta(D6A) and LD78beta(P8A) may represent effective chemokine-based anti-HIV-1 therapeutics while preserving LD78beta-CCR5 interactions.",,
9126929,Identification of amino acid residues important for ligand binding to Fas.,"The interaction of Fas (CD95), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family, and its ligand (FasL) triggers programmed cell death (apoptosis) and is involved in the regulation of immune responses. Although the Fas-FasL interaction is conserved across species barriers, little is currently known about the molecular details of this interaction. Our aim was to identify residues in Fas that are important for ligand binding. With the aid of a Fas molecular model, candidate amino acid residues were selected in the Fas extracellular domain 2 (D2) and D3 and subjected to serine-scanning mutagenesis to produce mutant Fas molecules in the form of Ig fusion proteins. The effects of these mutations on FasL binding was examined by measuring the ability of these proteins to inhibit FasL-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat cells and bind FasL in ELISA and BIAcore assays. Mutation of two amino acids, R86 and R87 (D2), to serine totally abolished the ability of Fas to interact with its ligand, whereas mutants K84S, L90S, E93S (D2), or H126S (D3) showed reduced binding compared with wild-type Fas. Two mutants (K78S and H95S) bound FasL comparably to wild type. Therefore, the binding of FasL involves residues in two domains that correspond to positions critical for ligand binding in other family members (TNFR and CD40) but are conserved between murine and human Fas.",The Journal of experimental medicine,1997
11278720,Identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase as a receptor for the growth factor pleiotrophin.,"Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a secreted growth factor that induces neurite outgrowth and is mitogenic for fibroblasts, epithelial, and endothelial cells. During tumor growth PTN can serve as an angiogenic factor and drive tumor invasion and metastasis. To identify a receptor for PTN, we panned a phage display human cDNA library against immobilized PTN protein as a bait. From this we isolated a phage insert that was homologous to an amino acid sequence stretch in the extracellular domain (ECD) of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In parallel with PTN, ALK is highly expressed during perinatal development of the nervous system and down-modulated in the adult. Here we show in cell-free assays as well as in radioligand receptor binding studies in intact cells that PTN binds to the ALK ECD with an apparent Kd of 32 +/- 9 pm. This receptor binding is inhibited by an excess of PTN, by the ALK ECD, and by anti-PTN and anti-ECD antibodies. PTN added to ALK-expressing cells induces phosphorylation of both ALK and of the downstream effector molecules IRS-1, Shc, phospholipase C-gamma, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Furthermore, the growth stimulatory effect of PTN on different cell lines in culture coincides with the endogenous expression of ALK mRNA, and the effect of PTN is enhanced by ALK overexpression. From this we conclude that ALK is a receptor that transduces PTN-mediated signals and propose that the PTN-ALK axis can play a significant role during development and during disease processes.",,
17068149,Identification of BMP9 and BMP10 as functional activators of the orphan activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) in endothelial cells.,"ALK1 is an endothelial-specific type I receptor of the TGFbeta receptor family whose heterozygous mutations cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2. Although TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta3 have been shown to bind ALK1 under specific experimental conditions, they may not represent the physiological ligands for this receptor. In the present study, we demonstrate that BMP9 induces the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in microvascular endothelial cells, and this phosphorylation lasts over a period of 24 hours. BMP9 also activates the ID1 promoter-derived BMP response element (BRE) in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 45 +/- 27 pg/mL), and this activation is abolished by silencing ALK1 expression or addition of ALK1 extracellular domain. Overexpression of endoglin increases the BMP9 response, whereas silencing of both BMPRII and ActRIIA expressions completely abolishes it. BMP10, which is structurally close to BMP9, is also a potent ALK1 ligand. Finally, we demonstrate that BMP9 and BMP10 potently inhibit endothelial cell migration and growth, and stimulate endothelial expression of a panel of genes that was previously reported to be activated by the constitutively active form of ALK1. Taken together, our results suggest that BMP9 and BMP10 are two specific ALK1 ligands that may physiologically trigger the effects of ALK1 on angiogenesis.",,
9687537,Identification of C-C chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) as the monocyte hemofiltrate C-C chemokine (HCC)-1 receptor.,"Hemofiltrate C-C chemokine (HCC)-1 is a recently cloned C-C chemokine that is structurally similar to macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha. Unlike most chemokines, it is constitutively secreted by tissues and is present at high concentrations in normal human plasma. Also atypical for chemokines, HCC-1 is reported not to be chemotactic for leukocytes. In this paper, we have investigated the chemokine receptor usage and downstream signaling pathways of HCC-1. Cross-desensitization experiments using THP-1 cells suggested that HCC-1 and MIP-1alpha activated the same receptor. Experiments using a panel of cloned chemokine receptors revealed that HCC-1 specifically activated C-C chemokine receptor (CCR)1, but not closely related receptors, including CCR5. HCC-1 competed with MIP-1alpha for binding to CCR1-transfected cells, but with a markedly reduced affinity (IC50 = 93 nM versus 1.3 nM for MIP-1alpha). Similarly, HCC-1 was less potent than MIP-1alpha in inducing inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in CCR1-transfected cells. HCC-1 induced chemotaxis of freshly isolated human monocytes, THP-1 cells, and CCR1-transfected cells, and the optimal concentration for cell migration (100 nM) was approximately 100-fold lower than that of MIP-1alpha (1 nM). These data demonstrate that HCC-1 is a chemoattractant and identify CCR1 as a functional HCC-1 receptor on human monocytes.",The Journal of experimental medicine,1998
9169459,"Identification of CCR6, the specific receptor for a novel lymphocyte-directed CC chemokine LARC.","Liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC) is a recently identified CC chemokine that is expressed mainly in the liver. LARC functions as a selective chemoattractant for lymphocytes that express a class of receptors specifically binding to LARC with high affinity. To identifiy the receptor for LARC, we examined LARC-induced calcium mobilization in cells stably expressing five CC chemokine receptors (CCR1-CCR5) and five orphan seven-transmembrane receptors. LARC specifically induced calcium flux in K562 cells as well as 293/EBNA-1 cells stably expressing an orphan receptor GPR-CY4. LARC induced migration in 293/EBNA-1 cells stably expressing GPR-CY4 with a bi-modal dose-response curve. LARC fused with secreted alkaline phosphatase (LARC-SEAP) bound specifically to Raji cells stably expressing GPR-CY4 with a Kd of 0.9 nM. Only LARC but not five other CC chemokines (MCP-1, RANTES, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and TARC) competed with LARC-SEAP for binding to GPR-CY4. By Northern blot analysis, GPR-CY4 mRNA was expressed mainly in spleen, lymph nodes, Appendix, and fetal liver among various human tissues. Among various leukocyte subsets, GPR-CY4 mRNA was detected in lymphocytes (CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and B cells) but not in natural killer cells, monocytes, or granulocytes. Expression of GPR-CY4 mRNA in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was strongly up-regulated by IL-2. Taken together, GPR-CY4 is the specific receptor for LARC expressed selectively on lymphocytes, and LARC is a unique functional ligand for GPR-CY4. We propose GPR-CY4 to be designated as CCR6.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
9211859,"Identification of CCR8, the receptor for the human CC chemokine I-309.","The nucleotide sequence for a putative chemokine receptor, termed TER1, ChemR1, or CKR-L1, was recently obtained by a polymerase chain reaction-based cloning technique. It encodes a protein of 355 amino acids that shows 32-45% sequence identity with human chemokine receptors. The gene was localized on human chromosome 3p21-24, the site for the genes for the five known CC chemokine receptors, suggesting that the natural ligand may be a CC chemokine. We have stably expressed this receptor in murine pre-B cells 300-19 and have tested their responsiveness to 20 human chemokines and some other potential agonists. The CC chemokine I-309 was the only agonist that selectively induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and chemotaxis in receptor-transfected 300-19 cells. Stromal cell-derived factor 1, which binds to murine CXCR4 expressed in parental as well as transfected 300-19 cells, served as positive control in the functional screening. The interaction of I-309 with TER1 was of high affinity as shown by 125I-I-309 binding (Kd of 1.2 nM) and transient [Ca2+]i changes at subnanomolar concentrations of agonist. Migration responses in receptor-transfected 300-19 cells was typically bimodal with maximal activity at 10 nM of I-309. These data demonstrate that TER1 (ChemR1 or CKR-L1) is the receptor for I-309, and we propose to call this receptor CCR8 in agreement with the current nomenclature for chemokine receptors. The expression of CCR8 in blood leukocytes and lymphocytes was analyzed by Northern blot. No transcripts were found in RNA from freshly isolated blood neutrophils, monocytes, cultured macrophages, and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T lymphocytes, and a faint hybridization signal corresponding to the RNA species of 4 kb was obtained only with RNA from interleukin-2-treated T lymphocytes. CCR8 is unusual for its selectivity for a single chemokine, previously shown only for CXCR1 and CXCR4, which bind interleukin-8 and stromal cell-derived factor 1, respectively. Identification of the receptor for I-309 represents a significant progress in determining the function of I-309 in inflammation and disease.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
26755705,Identification of CD112R as a novel checkpoint for human T cells.,"T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) and CD226 emerge as a novel T cell cosignaling pathway in which CD226 and TIGIT serve as costimulatory and coinhibitory receptors, respectively, for the ligands CD155 and CD112. In this study, we describe CD112R, a member of poliovirus receptor-like proteins, as a new coinhibitory receptor for human T cells. CD112R is preferentially expressed on T cells and inhibits T cell receptor-mediated signals. We further identify that CD112, widely expressed on antigen-presenting cells and tumor cells, is the ligand for CD112R with high affinity. CD112R competes with CD226 to bind to CD112. Disrupting the CD112R-CD112 interaction enhances human T cell response. Our experiments identify CD112R as a novel checkpoint for human T cells via interaction with CD112.",,
27294203,Identification of CD163 as an antiinflammatory receptor for HMGB1-haptoglobin complexes.,"Secreted by activated cells or passively released by damaged cells, extracellular HMGB1 is a prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) inflammatory mediator. During the course of developing extracorporeal approaches to treating injury and infection, we inadvertently discovered that haptoglobin, the acute phase protein that binds extracellular hemoglobin and targets cellular uptake through CD163, also binds HMGB1. Haptoglobin-HMGB1 complexes elicit the production of antiinflammatory enzymes (heme oxygenase-1) and cytokines (e.g., IL-10) in WT but not in CD163-deficient macrophages. Genetic disruption of haptoglobin or CD163 expression significantly enhances mortality rates in standardized models of intra-abdominal sepsis in mice. Administration of haptoglobin to WT and to haptoglobin gene-deficient animals confers significant protection. These findings reveal a mechanism for haptoglobin modulation of the inflammatory action of HMGB1, with significant implications for developing experimental strategies targeting HMGB1-dependent inflammatory diseases.",JCI insight,2016
10493512,Identification of CD47/integrin-associated protein and alpha(v)beta3 as two receptors for the alpha3(IV) chain of type IV collagen on tumor cells.,"Previous studies from our laboratories demonstrated that a peptide from the noncollagenous domain of the alpha3 chain of basement membrane collagen (COL IV), comprising residues 185-203, inhibits polymorphonuclear leukocyte activation and melanoma cell proliferation independently of its ability to promote cell adhesion; these properties require the presence of the triplet -SNS- at residues 189-191 (J. C. Monboisse et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269: 25475-25482, 1994; J. Han et al., J. Biol. Chem., 272: 20395-20401, 1997). More recently, we demonstrated that native COL IV and -SNS-containing synthetic peptides (10 microg/ml) added to culture medium inhibit the proliferation of not only melanoma cells but also breast, pancreas, and stomach tumor cells up to 82% and prostate tumor cells by 15%. This inhibition was shown to be dependent on a COL IV- or peptide-induced increase in intracellular cAMP (T. A. Shahan et al., Connect. Tissue Res., 40: 221-232, 1999). Attempts to identify the putative receptor(s) on tumor cells led to the isolation of five proteins (Mr 33,000, 52,000, 72,000, 95,000, and 250,000) from melanoma and prostate cells by affinity purification with the alpha3(IV)179-208 peptide. The Mr 52,000, 95,000, and 250,000 proteins were shown to be CD47/integrin-associated protein(IAP), the integrin beta3 subunit, and the alpha(v)beta3 integrin complex, respectively. The Mr 33,000 and 72,000 proteins have not yet been identified. To confirm the specificity of ligand binding to the receptors, cell membranes from either melanoma or prostate tumor cells were pretreated with the unlabeled ligand alpha3(IV)187-191 (-YYSNS-); alternatively, the peptide was pretreated with a peptide-reactive monoclonal antibody (A5D7) before receptor isolation. These treatments inhibited the purification of CD47/IAP, the integrin beta3 subunit, and the alpha(v)beta3 integrin complex from tumor cells. Furthermore, cells treated with CD47/IAP- or the alpha(v)beta3 integrin-reactive antibodies prevented the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide from inhibiting cell proliferation and the subsequent rise in intracellular cAMP. Pretreating cells with the alpha3(IV)187-191 (-YYSNS-) peptide also inhibited their adhesion to the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide substrate, whereas the inactive alpha1(IV)185-203 peptide, from the same region of the alpha1 chain as the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide, had no effect. Incubation of cells with either CD47/IAP and/or alpha(v)beta3 integrin-reactive antibodies inhibited their adhesion to the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide, whereas antibodies to the beta1 and beta2 integrin subunits were without effect. These data suggest that ALC-COL IV, through its alpha3(IV) chain, inhibits tumor cell proliferation using the receptors CD47/IAP and the alpha(v)beta3 integrin.",,
16917503,Identification of CD63 as a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 interacting cell surface protein.,"This study identified CD63, a member of the tetraspanin family, as a TIMP-1 interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. Immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic analysis confirmed CD63 interactions with TIMP-1, integrin beta1, and their co-localizations on the cell surface of human breast epithelial MCF10A cells. TIMP-1 expression correlated with the level of active integrin beta1 on the cell surface independent of cell adhesion. While MCF10A cells within a three-dimensional (3D) matrigel matrix form polarized acinar-like structures, TIMP-1 overexpression disrupted breast epithelial cell polarization and inhibited caspase-mediated apoptosis in centrally located cells, necessary for the formation and maintenance of the hollow acinar-like structures. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated CD63 downregulation effectively reduced TIMP-1 binding to the cell surface, TIMP-1 co-localization with integrin beta1, and consequently reversed TIMP-1-mediated integrin beta1 activation, cell survival signaling and apoptosis inhibition. CD63 downregulation also restored polarization and apoptosis of TIMP-1 overexpressing MCF10A cells within a 3D-matrigel matrix. Taken together, the present study identified CD63 as a cell surface binding partner for TIMP-1, regulating cell survival and polarization via TIMP-1 modulation of tetraspanin/integrin signaling complex.",The EMBO journal,2006
10652336,Identification of CD7 as a cognate of the human K12 (SECTM1) protein.,"CD7 is a 40-kDa protein found primarily on T, NK, and pre-B cells; the function of the CD7 protein in the immune system is largely unknown. The K12 (SECTM1) protein was originally identified by its location just upstream of the CD7 locus. The K12 gene encodes a transmembrane protein of unknown function. In order to clone a K12-binding protein, we generated a soluble version of the human K12 protein by fusing its extracellular domain to the Fc portion of human IgG(1). Flow cytometry experiments showed that the K12-Fc fusion protein bound at high levels to both human T and NK cells. Precipitation experiments using K12-Fc on (35)S-radiolabeled NK cells lysates indicated that the K12 cognate was an approximately 40-kDa protein. A human peripheral blood T cell cDNA expression library was screened with the K12-Fc protein, and two independent, positive cDNA clones were identified and sequenced. Both cDNAs encoded the same protein, which was CD7. Thus, K12 and CD7 are cognate proteins that are located next to each other on human chromosome 17q25. Additionally, we have cloned the gene encoding the mouse homologue of K12, shown that it maps near the mouse CD7 gene on chromosome 11, and established that the mouse K12 protein binds to mouse, but not human, CD7. Mouse K12-Fc inhibited in a dose-dependent manner concanavalin A-induced proliferation, but not anti-TcRalpha/beta induced proliferation, of mouse lymph node T cells. Human K12-Fc stimulated the up-regulation of CD25, CD54, and CD69 on human NK cells in vitro.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
11114375,Identification of CD72 as a lymphocyte receptor for the class IV semaphorin CD100: a novel mechanism for regulating B cell signaling.,"We have identified the lymphocyte semaphorin CD100/Sema4D as a CD40-inducible molecule by subtractive cDNA cloning. CD100 stimulation significantly enhanced the effects of CD40 on B cell responses. Administration of soluble CD100 markedly accelerated in vivo antigen-specific antibody responses. CD100 receptors with different binding affinities were detected on renal tubular cells (K(d) = approximately 1 x 10(-9)M) and lymphocytes (K(d) = approximately 3 x 10(-7)M). Expression cloning revealed that the CD100 receptor on lymphocytes is CD72, a negative regulator of B cell responsiveness. CD72 thus represents a novel class of semaphorin receptors. CD100 stimulation induced tyrosine dephosphorylation of CD72 and dissociation of SHP-1 from CD72. Our findings indicate that CD100 plays a critical role in immune responses by the novel mechanism of turning off negative signaling by CD72.",Immunity,2000
11278538,Identification of critical residues in bovine IFNAR-1 responsible for interferon binding.,"Interferons have antiviral, antigrowth and immunomodulatory effects. The human type I interferons, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-omega, induce somewhat different cellular effects but act through a common receptor complex, IFNAR, composed of subunits IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2. Human IFNAR-2 binds all type I IFNs but with lower affinity and different specificity than the IFNAR complex. Human IFNAR-1 has low intrinsic binding of human IFNs but strongly affects the affinity and differential ligand specificity of the IFNAR complex. Understanding IFNAR-1 interactions with the interferons is critical to elucidating the differential ligand specificity and activation by type I IFNs. However, studies of ligand interactions with human IFNAR-1 are compromised by its low affinity. The homologous bovine IFNAR-1 serendipitously binds human IFN-alphas with nanomolar affinity. Exploiting its strong binding of human IFN-alpha2, we have identified residues important for ligand binding. Mutagenesis of any of five aromatic residues of bovine IFNAR-1 caused strong decreases in ligand binding, whereas mutagenesis of proximal neutral or charged residues had smaller effects. These residues were mapped onto a homology model of IFNAR-1 to identify the ligand-binding face of IFNAR-1, which is consistent with previous structure/function studies of human IFNAR-1. The topology of IFNAR-1/IFN interactions appears novel when compared with previously studied cytokine receptors.",,
10721994,"Identification of DC-SIGN, a novel dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 receptor that supports primary immune responses.","Contact between dendritic cells (DC) and resting T cells is essential to initiate a primary immune response. Here, we demonstrate that ICAM-3 expressed by resting T cells is important in this first contact with DC. We discovered that instead of the common ICAM-3 receptors LFA-1 and alphaDbeta2, a novel DC-specific C-type lectin, DC-SIGN, binds ICAM-3 with high affinity. DC-SIGN, which is abundantly expressed by DC both in vitro and in vivo, mediates transient adhesion with T cells. Since antibodies against DC-SIGN inhibit DC-induced proliferation of resting T cells, our findings predict that DC-SIGN enables T cell receptor engagement by stabilization of the DC-T cell contact zone.",,
8903513,Identification of G-protein binding sites of the human interleukin-8 receptors by functional mapping of the intracellular loops.,"Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is considered to be a major mediator of the inflammatory response. Recent evidence indicates that a direct physical association occurs between IL-8 receptors and the alpha subunit of guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gi(alpha)2) upon stimulation of human neutrophils by IL-8. In the present study, we identified by site-directed mutagenesis key residues within the three intracellular loops of the IL-8RA receptor involved in the interaction with Gi(alpha)2. We first systematically mutated, in groups of two to four, all the residues in the three intracellular loops of the IL-8 type A receptor to alanine and analyzed the mutant receptors transiently expressed in 293 cells. Four residues in the second intracellular loop (Y136, L137, I139, V140) and one residue in the third intracellular loop (M241) were shown to be crucial for mediating calcium signaling in response to IL-8. Other residues in the second and third intracellular loops were also found to affect IL-8RA-mediated signaling, but to a lesser extent. These effects were not due to lower expression or low IL-8 binding affinities to the mutated receptors. Mutagenesis of the residues in the first intracellular loop had only weak effects on the mobilization of calcium induced by IL-8. We then used a coimmunoprecipitation protocol with anti-Gi(alpha)2 antibodies to determine the involvement of the two regions defined above in Gi(alpha)2 coupling to IL-8 type A receptors. Whereas the anti-Gi(alpha)2 antibodies coimmunoprecipitated IL-8 receptors in the wild-type cells, this interaction was lost in cells expressing mutated receptors that affected intracellular calcium mobilization. The peptides corresponding to the regions of the type A receptor found to be critical for Gi(alpha)2 coupling and induction of intracellular calcium mobilization were next introduced into cells expressing wild-type IL-8RA or IL-8RB to assess their role in coupling Gi(alpha)2 to both IL-8 receptors. The results obtained in the latter experiments suggest that the same regions of the second intracellular loop (Y136, L137, I139, V140) and of the third intracellular loop (M241) are critically involved in the coupling of both IL-8RA and IL-8 RB to Gi(alpha)2 as well as to a downstream effector (or effectors) involved in calcium mobilization.",,
11812005,Identification of G-proteins coupling to the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor VPAC(1) using immunoaffinity chromatography: evidence for precoupling.,"VPAC(1) receptor subtype-specific G-protein interactions were identified using a strategy that exploits an essential initial signaling event, namely the functional and physical association of the receptor with G-protein. An immunoaffinity purification column was constructed using a previously characterized antibody that had been raised against the first extracellular loop of the VPAC(1) receptor. VPAC(1)/G-protein complexes were solubilized from membranes and copurified. Receptor and Galpha-proteins were detected in eluates using (125)I-VIP labeling and immunoblotting, respectively. Human VPAC(1) transfected in HEK293 cells couples to Gs but not Gi3, Gi1/2, or Gq. Rat VPAC(1) in brain membranes is coupled to Gs and Gi3. Rat VPAC(1) in lung membranes couples to Gs, Gi3, and Gq. Pretreatment of membranes with VIP increased the level of all G-proteins copurifying with VPAC(1). Immunoaffinity chromatography also revealed VPAC(1) receptor precoupling to G-protein in the absence of VIP pretreatment. This was confirmed using a cross-linking procedure to capture VIP receptor/G-protein complexes in the native membrane milieu prior to solubilization. Precoupling suggests that there is a significant basal level of VPAC(1) receptor activity especially in cells, such as some human malignant tumor cells, that express high levels of receptor.",,
9160883,"Identification of Gas6 as a ligand for Mer, a neural cell adhesion molecule related receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in cellular transformation.","Mer/Nyk/Eyk is an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase expressed at high levels in monocytes and cells derived from epithelial and reproductive tissues. Overexpression of Mer has been associated with lymphoid malignancies. Here we identify Gas6, the product of a growth arrest specific gene, as a ligand for Mer. Gas6 has previously been shown to activate both Axl and Rse/Tyro3, two other receptor tyrosine kinases in the same family as Mer. The apparent relative association and dissociation rate constants of Gas6 for soluble Axl, Rse/Tyro3 and Mer were compared using surface plasmon resonance. Gas6 was shown to induce rapid phosphorylation of Mer expressed in several different types of cells. We also observed a transient activation of p42 MAP kinase following activation of Mer by Gas6. Thus, Gas6 exerts its biological effects through multiple receptor tyrosine kinases.",Oncogene,1997
2468670,Identification of glycoprotein IV (CD36) as a primary receptor for platelet-collagen adhesion.,"The role of glycoprotein IV (GPIV) in platelet activation processes has been examined by several different approaches: (i) Fab fragments of a monospecific polyclonal antibody to purified platelet GPIV (approximately 20 micrograms/ml) completely inhibited platelet shape change, aggregation, and secretion induced by collagen. Aggregation and secretion by ADP (but not shape change) and by epinephrine were also inhibited, but there was no effect on platelet activation induced by thrombin, arachidonate, or ionophore A23187. (ii) Purified GPIV was able to compete completely with membrane-bound GPIV to inhibit platelet activation induced by collagen, including shape change, but not in activation induced by any of the other platelet agonists. 50% inhibition of collagen-induced activation and secretion were obtained at GPIV concentrations of approximately 10 nM (1 micrograms/ml). (iii) Purified GPIV bound rapidly and reversibly to collagen Type I fibrils, and binding was not inhibited by adhesive proteins such as denatured collagen, fibronectin, fibrinogen, or von Willebrand factor. The direct binding of purified GPIV to collagen Type I fibrils fit best to a single site model with Kd 0.34 +/- 0.10 nM. (iv) Using a microtiter assay, platelet adhesion to collagen was shown to be inhibited by Fab fragments of monospecific polyclonal anti-GPIV antibodies, but adhesion to other adhesive proteins was unaffected. (v) When anti-GPIV was added at various times during adhesion the time dependence of inhibition was seen to be biphasic. Anti-GP antibody was able to reverse adhesion that occurred within the first 5-8 min and to inhibit adhesion occurring thereafter. These results demonstrate that GPIV mediates the early stages of platelet recognition by and attachment to collagen but that there may be a second GPIV-independent mechanism that mediates the subsequent anchorage of these adherent platelets.",,
10922494,Identification of group X secretory phospholipase A(2) as a natural ligand for mouse phospholipase A(2) receptor.,"Phospholipase A(2) receptor (PLA(2)R) mediates various biological responses elicited by group IB secretory phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)-IB). The recently cloned group X sPLA(2) (sPLA(2)-X) possesses several structural features characteristic of sPLA(2)-IB. Here, we detected a specific binding site of sPLA(2)-X in mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E(1) cells. Cross-linking experiments demonstrated its molecular weight (180 kDa) to be similar to that of PLA(2)R. In fact, sPLA(2)-X was found to bind the recombinant PLA(2)R expressed in COS-7 cells, and its specific binding detected in mouse lung membranes was abolished by the deficiency of PLA(2)R. These findings demonstrate sPLA(2)-X to be one of the high-affinity ligands for mouse PLA(2)R.",FEBS letters,2000
8786317,Identification of haptoglobin as an alternative ligand for CD11b/CD18.,"Haptoglobin is an acute phase protein with presumed anti-inflammatory activities. We report that purified fluorescein-labeled haptoglobin 1-1 binds to THP1 and U937 promonocytic cell lines, to monocytes, to granulocytes, and to a subset of CD8+ T cells and to NK cells. Studies with radioiodinated haptoglobin on THP1 cells were consistent with specific binding to one class of receptors with a density of 1.7 x 10(5) binding sites per cell and a low affinity of 6.5 x 10(-6) Kd. Binding was increased by Ca2+ and by Ca2+ and ADP. Binding to THP1 and U937 cells could be inhibited by preincubation with nonfluoresceinated haptoglobin and by fibrinogen, but not by albumin, transferrin, or alpha1-acid glycoprotein. Fibrinogen binds to the CD11b/CD18 integrin. We therefore examined whether haptoglobin has the same receptor. The anti-CD11b mAb44 indeed inhibited the binding of fluoresceinated haptoglobin to THP1 and U937 cell lines, and haptoglobin inhibited the binding of the anti-CD11b mAb anti-Leu15 and mAb44 to both cell lines. An anti-CD18 mAb partly inhibited the binding of fluoresceinated haptoglobin to THP1 and U937, indicating that the beta-chain of MAC-1 is also involved in haptoglobin binding. There was no interference between the binding of anti-CD4, anti-CD11a, or anti-CD11c mAb and haptoglobin binding to THP1 cells. Binding of haptoglobin to purified CD11b/CD18 indicates that it binds directly to the receptor. Haptoglobin is an alternative low affinity ligand for the CD11b/CD18 integrin, suggesting that this acute phase protein might regulate MAC-1-dependent cell function in vivo.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1996

Several complementary DNA clones encoding related HRGs were identified, all of which are similar to proteins in the epidermal growth factor family. Scatchard analysis of the binding of recombinant HRG to a breast tumor cell line expressing p185erbB2 showed a single high affinity binding site [dissociation constant (Kd) = 105 +/- 15 picomolar]. Heregulin transcripts were identified in several normal tissues and cancer cell lines. The HRGs may represent the natural ligands for p185erbB2.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1992
10377245,Identification of human complement Factor H as a ligand for L-selectin.,"The selectin family of adhesion molecules (E-, P- and L-selectins) is involved in leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation and tissue damage. Recently it has been shown that L-selectin is involved not only in leukocyte tethering and rolling, but also plays an important role in leukocyte activation. For example, glycosylation-dependent cell-adhesion molecule 1 (GlyCAM-1), a known ligand for L-selectin, has been shown to enhance beta2-integrin function. GlyCAM-1 is a secreted protein and is present in mouse serum at a concentration of approx. 1.5 microg/ml. There is no obvious GlyCAM-1 homologue in man and, to date, L-selectin ligand(s) from human serum have not been characterized. Therefore we have used L-selectin affinity chromatography, followed by ion-exchange chromatography, to isolate specific ligand(s) for L-selectin. Using this procedure, we have isolated three major glycoproteins of apparent molecular masses 170 kDa, 70kDa and 50 kDa. The 170 kDa protein band was digested with trypsin and peptides were analysed by delayed extraction matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS and protein database searching. The 170 kDa protein was identified as the human complement protein Factor H. Human Factor H, isolated by a different method, was shown to bind specifically to L-selectin in the presence of CaCl2, and binding was inhibited by anti-L-selectin antibodies, fucoidan and lipopolysaccharide. Only a part of the purified Factor H preparation bound to immobilized L-selectin. The interaction of Factor H with leukocyte L-selectin was shown to induce the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Pretreatment of Factor H with sialidase reduced both the binding of L-selectin to Factor H and the Factor H-induced L-selectin-mediated TNF-alpha secretion by leukocytes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a post-translationally modified form of human plasma Factor H is a potential physiological ligand for L-selectin.",,
12036876,Identification of integrin alpha(M)beta(2) as an adhesion receptor on peripheral blood monocytes for Cyr61 (CCN1) and connective tissue growth factor (CCN2): immediate-early gene products expressed in atherosclerotic lesions.,"Cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61, CCN1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, CCN2) are growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene products found in blood vessel walls and healing cutaneous wounds. We previously reported that the adhesion of endothelial cells, platelets, and fibroblasts to these extracellular matrix-associated proteins is mediated through integrin receptors. In this study, we demonstrated that both Cyr61 and CTGF are expressed in advanced atherosclerotic lesions of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Because monocyte adhesion and transmigration are important for atherosclerosis, wound healing, and inflammation, we examined the interaction of THP-1 monocytic cells and isolated peripheral blood monocytes with Cyr61 and CTGF. THP-1 cells and monocytes adhered to Cyr61- or CTGF-coated wells in an activation-dependent manner and this process was mediated primarily through integrin alpha(M)beta(2). Additionally, expression of alpha(M)beta(2) on human embryonic kidney 293 cells resulted in enhanced cell adhesion to Cyr61. Consistent with these data, a GST-fusion protein containing the I domain of the integrin alpha(M) subunit bound specifically to immobilized Cyr61 or CTGF. We have also investigated the requirement of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as coreceptors for monocyte adhesion to Cyr61. Pretreatment of monocytes with heparin or heparinase I resulted in partial inhibition of cell adhesion to Cyr61. However, monocytes, but not fibroblasts, were capable of adhering to a Cyr61 mutant deficient in heparin binding activity. Collectively, these results show that activated monocytes adhere to Cyr61 and CTGF through integrin alpha(M)beta(2) and cell surface HSPGs. However, unlike fibroblast adhesion to Cyr61, cell surface HSPGs are not absolutely required for this adhesion process.",,
10801840,Identification of key residues for interaction of vasoactive intestinal peptide with human VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors and development of a highly selective VPAC1 receptor agonist. Alanine scanning and molecular modeling of the peptide.,"The widespread neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has two receptors VPAC(1) and VPAC(2). Solid-phase syntheses of VIP analogs in which each amino acid has been changed to alanine (Ala scan) or glycine was achieved and each analog was tested for: (i) three-dimensional structure by ab initio molecular modeling; (ii) ability to inhibit (125)I-VIP binding (K(i)) and to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity (EC(50)) in membranes from cell clones stably expressing human recombinant VPAC(1) or VPAC(2) receptor. The data show that substituting residues at 14 positions out of 28 in VIP resulted in a >10-fold increase of K(i) or EC(50) at the VPAC(1) receptor. Modeling of the three-dimensional structure of native VIP (central alpha-helice from Val(5) to Asn(24) with random coiled N and C terminus) and analogs shows that substitutions of His(1), Val(5), Arg(14), Lys(15), Lys(21), Leu(23), and Ile(26) decreased biological activity without altering the predicted structure, supporting that those residues directly interact with VPAC(1) receptor. The interaction of the analogs with human VPAC(2) receptor is similar to that observed with VPAC(1) receptor, with three remarkable exceptions: substitution of Thr(11) and Asn(28) by alanine increased K(i) for binding to VPAC(2) receptor; substitution of Tyr(22) by alanine increased EC(50) for stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity through interaction with the VPAC(2) receptor. By combining 3 mutations at positions 11, 22, and 28, we developed the [Ala(11,22,28)]VIP analog which constitutes the first highly selective (>1,000-fold) human VPAC(1) receptor agonist derived from VIP ever described.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
8702767,Identification of ligand binding determinants in the somatostatin receptor subtypes 1 and 2.,"The somatostatin (SRIF) receptors (SSTRs) 1 and 2 bind SRIF and SRIF 28 with high affinity, although a number of synthetic hexapeptide and octapeptide analogs of SRIF bind selectively to SSTR2. Extracellular loop three and its adjoining trans-membrane-spanning regions contain elements essential for the binding of such analogs to murine SSTR2. In particular, a stretch of amino acids from residues 294-297 (FDFV) in murine SSTR2 in trans-membrane domain seven can determine affinity for the SSTR2-selective analogs. Within this region, Phe294 has previously been predicted to be essential for the binding of octapeptides (Kaupmann, K., Bruns, C., Raulf, F., Weber, H., Mattes, H., and Lubbert, H. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 727-735) based on the observation that SSTR1 can bind the octapeptide SMS-201-995 with reasonable affinity after a Ser-to-Phe conversion in the analogous region of this receptor (SSTR1S305F). We find that SSTR1S305F has low affinity for a number of SSTR2-selective hexapeptides, suggesting that these analogs have different binding requirements than SMS-201-995. A correlation is seen between the ability of SSTR1S305F to bind hexapeptide analogs and the presence of a phenylalanine, but not tyrosine, at position two in these small cyclic molecules. Thus, a single hydroxyl group in hexapeptides can play a critical role in determining receptor binding to these receptor mutants. We also find that the second extracellular loop of SSTR1 is important for the selectivity of certain SRIF agonists for binding to SSTR1. Taken together, our data indicate that there are multiple elements in the somatostatin receptors that can determine the binding affinity and selectivity of peptide analogs.",,
10073957,Identification of megalin/gp330 as a receptor for lipoprotein(a) in vitro.,"Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an atherogenic lipoprotein of unknown physiological function. The mechanism of Lp(a) atherogenicity as well as its catabolic pathways are only incompletely understood at present. In this report, we show that the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family member megalin/glycoprotein (gp) 330 is capable of binding and mediating the cellular uptake and degradation of Lp(a) in vitro. A mouse embryonic yolk sac cell line with native expression of megalin/gp330 but genetically deficient in LDLR-related protein (LRP) and a control cell line carrying a double knockout for both LRP and megalin/gp330 were compared with regard to their ability to bind, internalize, and degrade dioctadecyltetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI)-fluorescence-labeled Lp(a) as well as equimolar amounts of 125I-labeled Lp(a) and LDL. Uptake and degradation of radiolabeled Lp(a) by the megalin/gp330-expressing cells were, on average, 2-fold higher than that of control cells. This difference could be completely abolished by addition of the receptor-associated protein, an inhibitor of ligand binding to megalin/gp330. Mutual suppression of the uptake of 125I-Lp(a) and of 125I-LDL by both unlabeled Lp(a) and LDL suggested that Lp(a) uptake is mediated at least partially by apolipoprotein B100. Binding and uptake of DiI-Lp(a) resulted in strong signals on megalin/gp330-expressing cells versus background only on control cells. In addition, we show that purified megalin/gp330, immobilized on a sensor chip, directly binds Lp(a) in a Ca2+-dependent manner with an affinity similar to that for LDL. We conclude that megalin/gp330 binds Lp(a) in vitro and is capable of mediating its cellular uptake and degradation.",,
10471841,Identification of melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) as the natural ligand for the orphan somatostatin-like receptor 1 (SLC-1).,"To identify possible ligands of the orphan somatostatin-like receptor 1 (SLC-1), rat brain extracts were analyzed by using the functional expression system of Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNAs encoding SLC-1 and G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRK). A strong inward current was observed with crude rat brain extracts which upon further purification by cation exchange chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) yielded two peptides with a high agonist activity. Mass spectrometry and partial peptide sequencing revealed that one peptide is identical with the neuropeptide melanin concentrating hormone (MCH), the other represents a truncated version of MCH lacking the three N-terminal amino acid residues. Xenopus oocytes expressing the MCH receptor responded to nM concentrations of synthetic MCH not only by the activation of GIRK-mediated currents but also by the induction of Ca(2+) dependent chloride currents mediated by phospholipase C. This indicates that the MCH receptor can couple either to the G(i)- or G(q)-mediated signal transduction pathway, suggesting that MCH may serve for a number of distinct brain functions including food uptake behavior.",FEBS letters,1999
17416748,Identification of mouse Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (Darc) as a BMD QTL gene.,"It is now well known that bone mineral density (BMD) variance is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. Accordingly, studies in human and animal models have revealed evidence for the presence of several quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to BMD variations. However, the identification of BMD QTL genes remains a big challenge. In the current study, we focused our efforts to identify the BMD candidate gene in chromosome 1 (Chr 1) QTL that was detected from a cross involving high BMD CAST/EiJ (CAST) and low BMD C57BL/6J (B6) mice. To this end, we have combined several approaches including: (1) fine mapping the BMD QTL in Chr 1 of the B6.CAST F2 female mice using a large number of polymorphic markers; (2) the generation of congenic sublines of mice by repeated backcrossing of CAST with B6 mice and phenotype characterization; (3) expression profiling genes in the QTL region; and (4) SNP analyses to identify the mouse Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (Darc) as a candidate gene for Chr 1 BMD QTL2. We verified the involvement of the Darc protein in BMD variation by evaluating the skeletal phenotype of Darc-knockout mice and congenic sublines of mice carrying small chromosomal segments from CAST BMD QTL. Based on the findings that Darc-antibody blocked formation of multinucleated osteoclasts in vitro and that Darc from CAST binds chemokines, known to regulate osteoclast formation, with reduced affinity compared with Darc from B6 mice, we conclude that Darc regulates BMD negatively by increasing osteoclast formation, and that the genetic association between Darc gene polymorphism and BMD variations in humans merits investigation.",,
15823563,Identification of MrgX2 as a human G-protein-coupled receptor for proadrenomedullin N-terminal peptides.,"Proadrenomedullin N-terminal 20 peptide (PAMP[1-20]/PAMP-20) and its truncated analog, PAMP[9-20]/PAMP-12, are endogenous peptides that elicit hypotension through inhibiting catecholamine secretion from sympathetic nerve endings and adrenal chromaffin cells. Although the binding sites for PAMP are widely distributed, the nature of its receptor has been elusive. In an effort to identify potential PAMP receptor(s), we found that a human G-protein-coupled receptor, MrgX2, was specifically activated by PAMP. Although a previous study revealed that MrgX2 was a receptor for cortistatin, a neuropeptide involved in sleep regulation and locomotor activity, our present data indicated that the rank order of the agonistic effect against MrgX2 was ""PAMP-12> or =cortistatin>PAMP-20"". These activities were confirmed by the inhibition of the forskolin-elevated cAMP accumulation, Ca(2+) mobilization, and [(35)S]guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate binding assays. These findings suggest that MrgX2 couples with not only G(alpha q) but also G(alpha i), consistent with previous reports on the pharmacological profile of PAMP signaling. Furthermore, by immunostaining, we found that MrgX2 was expressed in the adrenal chromaffin cells as well as the dorsal root ganglia. From these results, we concluded that MrgX2 is a potential human PAMP-12 receptor that regulates catecholamine secretion from adrenal glands. The present discovery will eventually lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiological role of proadrenomedullin peptides.",,
12401809,Identification of natural ligands for the orphan G protein-coupled receptors GPR7 and GPR8.,"GPR7 and GPR8 are two structurally related orphan G protein-coupled receptors, presenting high similarities with opioid and somatostatin receptors. Two peptides, L8 and L8C, derived from a larger precursor, were recently described as natural ligands for GPR8 (Mori, M., Shimomura, Y., Harada, M., Kurihara, M., Kitada, C., Asami, T., Matsumoto, Y., Adachi, Y., Watanabe, T., Sugo, T., and Abe, M. (December, 27, 2001) World Patent Cooperation Treaty, Patent Application WO 01/98494A1). L8 is a 23-amino acid peptide, whereas L8C is the same peptide with a C terminus extension of 7 amino acids, running through a dibasic motif of proteolytic processing. Using as a query the amino acid sequence of the L8 peptide, we have identified in DNA databases a human gene predicted to encode related peptides and its mouse ortholog. By analogy with L8 and L8C, two peptides, named L7 and L7C could result from the processing of a 125-amino acid human precursor through the alternative usage of a dibasic amino acid motif. The activity of these four peptides was investigated on GPR7 and GPR8. In binding assays, L7, L7C, L8, and L8C were found to bind with low nanomolar affinities to the GPR7 and GPR8 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells. They inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation through a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. The tissue distribution of prepro-L7 (ppL7) and prepro-L8 (ppL8) was investigated by reverse transcription-PCR. Abundant ppL7 transcripts were found throughout the brain as well as in spinal cord, spleen, testis, and placenta; ppL8 transcripts displayed a more restricted distribution in brain, with high levels in substantia nigra, but were more abundant in peripheral tissues. The ppL7 and ppL8 genes therefore encode the precursors of a class of peptide ligands, active on two receptor subtypes, GPR7 and GPR8. The distinct tissue distribution of the receptor and peptide precursors suggest that each ligand and receptor has partially overlapping but also specific roles in this signaling system.",,
15635449,Identification of neuromedin S and its possible role in the mammalian circadian oscillator system.,"The discovery of neuropeptides has resulted in an increased understanding of novel regulatory mechanisms of certain physiological phenomena. Here we identify a novel neuropeptide of 36 amino-acid residues in rat brain as an endogenous ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor FM-4/TGR-1, which was identified to date as the neuromedin U (NMU) receptor, and designate this peptide 'neuromedin S (NMS)' because it is specifically expressed in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. NMS shares a C-terminal core structure with NMU. The NMS precursor contains another novel peptide. NMS mRNA is highly expressed in the central nervous system, spleen and testis. In rat brain, NMS expression is restricted to the core of the SCN and has a diurnal peak under light/dark cycling, but remains stable under constant darkness. Intracerebroventricular administration of NMS in rats activates SCN neurons and induces nonphotic type phase shifts in the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity. These findings suggest that NMS in the SCN is implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms through autocrine and/or paracrine actions.",,
12130646,Identification of neuropeptide W as the endogenous ligand for orphan G-protein-coupled receptors GPR7 and GPR8.,"The structurally related orphan G-protein-coupled receptors GPR7 and GPR8 are expressed in the central nervous system, and their ligands have not been identified. Here, we report the identification of the endogenous ligand for both of these receptors. We purified the peptide ligand from porcine hypothalamus using stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing human GPR8 and cloned the cDNA encoding its precursor protein. The cDNA encodes two forms of the peptide ligand with lengths of 23 and 30 amino acid residues as mature peptides. We designated the two ligands neuropeptide W-23 (NPW23) and neuropeptide W-30 (NPW30). The amino acid sequence of NPW23 is completely identical to that of the N-terminal 23 residues of NPW30. Synthetic NPW23 and NPW30 activated and bound to both GPR7 and GPR8 at similar effective doses. Intracerebroventricular administration of NPW23 in rats increased food intake and stimulated prolactin release. These findings indicate that neuropeptide W is the endogenous ligand for both GPR7 and GPR8 and acts as a mediator of the central control of feeding and the neuroendocrine system.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
15292271,Identification of novel beta1 integrin binding sites in the type 1 and type 2 repeats of thrombospondin-1.,"In addition to the three known beta(1) integrin recognition sites in the N-module of thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), we found that beta(1) integrins mediate cell adhesion to the type 1 and type 2 repeats. The type 1 repeats of TSP1 differ from typical integrin ligands in that recognition is pan-beta(1)-specific. Adhesion of cells that express one dominant beta(1) integrin on immobilized type 1 repeats is specifically inhibited by antagonists of that integrin, whereas adhesion of cells that express several beta(1) integrins is partially inhibited by each alpha-subunit-specific antagonist and completely inhibited by combining the antagonists. beta(1) integrins recognize both the second and third type 1 repeats, and each type 1 repeat shows pan-beta(1) specificity and divalent cation dependence for promoting cell adhesion. Adhesion to the type 2 repeats is less sensitive to alpha-subunit antagonists, but a beta(1) blocking antibody and two disintegrins inhibit adhesion to immobilized type 2 repeats. beta(1) integrin expression is necessary for cell adhesion to the type 1 or type 2 repeats, and beta(1) integrins bind in a divalent cation-dependent manner to a type 1 repeat affinity column. The widely used TSP1 function blocking antibody A4.1 binds to a site in the third type 2 repeat. A4.1 proximally inhibits beta(1) integrin-dependent adhesion to the type 2 repeats and indirectly inhibits integrin-dependent adhesion mediated by the TSP1 type 1 repeats. Although antibody A4.1 is also an antagonist of CD36 binding to TSP1, these data suggest that some biological activities of A4.1 result from antagonism of these novel beta(1) integrin binding sites.",,
12606401,"Identification of novel isoforms of activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7) generated by alternative splicing and expression of ALK7 and its ligand, Nodal, in human placenta.","Members of the transforming growth factor (TGF) beta family play critical roles in regulating placental functions. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategies, we have cloned four transcripts encoding full-length activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7) and three novel ALK7 isoforms from the human placenta. The full-length ALK7 has 493 amino acids and exhibits all characteristics of TGFbeta type I receptors, including an activin receptor-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, a GS domain, and a serine/threonine kinase domain. The three ALK7 isoforms identified include a truncated ALK7 (tALK7) and two soluble proteins designated as soluble ALK7a (sALK7a) and soluble ALK7b (sALK7b). The tALK7 lacks the first 50 amino acids of the full-length ALK7, resulting in a truncated receptor-binding domain. Both sALK7a and sALK7b lack transmembrane and GS domains. The ALK7 gene, located on chromosome 2q24.1, is composed of at least nine exons and eight introns. The isoforms of ALK7 are generated by alternative splicing. Transcripts encoding the sALK7 isoforms differ from the full-length transcript by lacking exon III or both exons III and IV in sALK7a and sALK7b, respectively. The transcript for tALK7 uses an alternative exon located within the first intron of the full-length transcript. These results indicate that four distinct proteins are encoded by the human ALK7 gene. Both reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that ALK7 and its isoforms are expressed in human placentae of different stages of pregnancy and that their expression is developmentally regulated. In addition, mRNA expression of Nodal, a ligand for ALK7, was also detected in placentae of different gestational age. The role of Nodal and ALK7 in human placenta is currently under investigation.",,
12724320,"Identification of p2y9/GPR23 as a novel G protein-coupled receptor for lysophosphatidic acid, structurally distant from the Edg family.","Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid mediator with diverse physiological and pathological actions on many types of cells. LPA has been widely considered to elicit its biological functions through three types of G protein-coupled receptors, Edg-2 (endothelial cell differentiation gene-2)/LPA1/vzg-1 (ventricular zone gene-1), Edg-4/LPA2, and Edg-7/LPA3. We identified an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, p2y9/GPR23, as the fourth LPA receptor (LPA4). Membrane fractions of RH7777 cells transiently expressing p2y9/GPR23 displayed a specific binding for 1-oleoyl-LPA with a Kd value of around 45 nm. Competition binding and reporter gene assays showed that p2y9/GPR23 preferred structural analogs of LPA with a rank order of 1-oleoyl- > 1-stearoyl- > 1-palmitoyl- > 1-myristoyl- > 1-alkyl- > 1-alkenyl-LPA. In Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing p2y9/GPR23, 1-oleoyl-LPA induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that mRNA of p2y9/GPR23 was significantly abundant in ovary compared with other tissues. Interestingly, p2y9/GPR23 shares only 20-24% amino acid identities with Edg-2/LPA1, Edg-4/LPA2, and Edg-7/LPA3, and phylogenetic analysis also shows that p2y9/GPR23 is far distant from the Edg family. These facts suggest that p2y9/GPR23 has evolved from different ancestor sequences from the Edg family.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
11461914,Identification of peptide ligand-binding domains within the human motilin receptor using photoaffinity labeling.,"The cDNA encoding the human motilin receptor was recently cloned and found to represent a G protein-coupled receptor that is structurally related to the growth hormone secretagogue receptors. Together, these represent a new Class I receptor family. Our aim in the present work is to gain insight into the molecular basis of binding of motilin to its receptor using photoaffinity labeling. To achieve this, we developed a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that overexpressed functional motilin receptor (CHO-MtlR; 175,000 sites per cell, with K(i) = 2.3 +/- 0.4 nm motilin and EC(50) = 0.3 +/- 0.1 nm motilin) and a radioiodinatable peptide analogue of human motilin that incorporated a photolabile p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) residue into its pharmacophoric domain. This probe, [Bpa(1),Ile(13)]motilin, was a full agonist at the motilin receptor that increased intracellular calcium in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50) = 1.5 +/- 0.4 nm). This photolabile ligand bound specifically and with high affinity to the motilin receptor (K(i) = 12.4 +/- 1.0 nm), and covalently labeled that molecule within its M(r) = 45,000 deglycosylated core. Cyanogen bromide cleavage demonstrated its covalent attachment to fragments of the receptor having apparent M(r) = 6,000 and M(r) = 31,000. These were demonstrated to represent fragments that included both the first and the large second extracellular loop domains, with the latter representing a unique structural feature of this receptor. The spatial approximation of the pharmacophoric domain of motilin with these receptor domains support their functional importance as well.",,
25535841,Identification of PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 as the transmembrane receptors for the multifunctional factor PEDF.,"Pigment Epithelium Derived Factor (PEDF) is a secreted factor that has broad biological activities. It was first identified as a neurotrophic factor and later as the most potent natural antiangiogenic factor, a stem cell niche factor, and an inhibitor of cancer cell growth. Numerous animal models demonstrated its therapeutic value in treating blinding diseases and diverse cancer types. A long-standing challenge is to reveal how PEDF acts on its target cells and the identities of the cell-surface receptors responsible for its activities. Here we report the identification of transmembrane proteins PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 as cell-surface receptors for PEDF. Using distinct cellular models, we demonstrate their cell type-specific receptor activities through loss of function and gain of function studies. Our experiments suggest that PEDF receptors form homooligomers under basal conditions, and PEDF dissociates the homooligomer to activate the receptors. Mutations in the intracellular domain can have profound effects on receptor activities.",eLife,2014
9625756,Identification of podocalyxin-like protein as a high endothelial venule ligand for L-selectin: parallels to CD34.,"The leukocyte adhesion molecule, L-selectin, mediates the recruitment of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs via interactions with specific ligands presented on high endothelial venules (HEV). Although the HEV-derived ligands for L-selectin are still incompletely defined, they share a common sialomucin-like structure which is thought to present clustered oligosaccharides to the lectin domain of L-selectin. Podocalyxin-like protein (PCLP) is a transmembrane sialomucin that is similar in structure to the well-characterized L-selectin ligand CD34. PCLP has been shown previously to be expressed on the foot processes of podocytes in the kidney glomerulus as well as on vascular endothelium at some sites. We have determined that PCLP is present on HEV, where it binds to both recombinant L-selectin and the HEV-specific monoclonal antibody MECA-79. Furthermore, purified HEV-derived PCLP is able to support the tethering and rolling of lymphocytes under physiological flow conditions in vitro. These results suggest a novel function for PCLP as an adhesion molecule and allow the definition of conserved structural features in PCLP and CD34, which may be important for L-selectin ligand function.",The Journal of experimental medicine,1998
11520208,Identification of potent non-peptide somatostatin antagonists with sst(3) selectivity.,"Using a solution-phase parallel synthesis strategy, a series of non-peptide somatostatin analogues were prepared, and their binding affinities to the five human somatostatin receptor subtypes (sst(1-5)) were determined. Imidazolyl derivatives 2 were found to bind with moderate affinity but with high selectivity to the sst(3) receptor subtype. Further modifications of these structures led to a more potent class of ligands, the tetrahydro-beta-carboline derivatives 4. Among these, compounds 4k (BN81644) and 4n (BN81674) bind selectively and with high affinity to the sst(3) receptor subtype (K(i) = 0.64 and 0.92 nM, respectively). Furthermore, 4k and 4n reverse the inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation induced by 1 nM somatostatin via sst(3) receptors, with IC(50) = 2.7 and 0.84 nM, respectively. The most potent compound 4n was shown to be a competitive antagonist of human sst(3) receptors by increasing the EC(50) of SRIF-14-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation with a K(B) of 2.8 nM (where K(B) is the concentration of antagonist that shifts the agonist dose-response 2-fold). These new derivatives are, to our knowledge, the first potent and highly selective non-peptide human sst(3) antagonists known and, as such, are useful tools for investigating the physiological role of sst(3) receptors.",Journal of medicinal chemistry,2001
11087996,Identification of proteins interacting with the rat somatostatin receptor subtype 2.,"Using the yeast two hybrid system we have identified a novel protein termed somatostatin receptor interacting protein (SSTRIP) from human brain which interacts with the rat somatostatin receptor subtype 2. Interaction with the receptor C-terminus is mediated by a PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain which exhibits high similarity to the PDZ domain of cortactin binding protein 1 (CortBP1). SSTRIP and CortBP1 define a novel family of multidomain proteins containing ankyrin repeats, SH3- and SH3 binding regions and a sterile alpha motif (SAM domain) in addition to the PDZ domain. Both SSTRIP and CortBP1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with the somatostatin receptor when co-expressed in HEK cells. Interestingly, co-localization of SSTR2 and CortBP1 at the plasma membrane is increased when SSTR2 is stimulated by agonists.","Journal of physiology, Paris",2000
15851487,Identification of proteoglycans as the APRIL-specific binding partners.,"B cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) are closely related ligands within the TNF superfamily that play important roles in B lymphocyte biology. Both ligands share two receptors--transmembrane activator and calcium signal--modulating cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)--that are predominantly expressed on B cells. In addition, BAFF specifically binds BAFF receptor, whereas the nature of a postulated APRIL-specific receptor remains elusive. We show that the TNF homology domain of APRIL binds BCMA and TACI, whereas a basic amino acid sequence (QKQKKQ) close to the NH2 terminus of the mature protein is required for binding to the APRIL-specific ""receptor."" This interactor was identified as negatively charged sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Although T cell lines bound little APRIL, the ectopic expression of glycosaminoglycan-rich syndecans or glypicans conferred on these cells a high binding capacity that was completely dependent on APRIL's basic sequence. Moreover, syndecan-1-positive plasma cells and proteoglycan-rich nonhematopoietic cells displayed high specific, heparin-sensitive binding to APRIL. Inhibition of BAFF and APRIL, but not BAFF alone, prevented the survival and/or the migration of newly formed plasma cells to the bone marrow. In addition, costimulation of B cell proliferation by APRIL was only effective upon APRIL oligomerization. Therefore, we propose a model whereby APRIL binding to the extracellular matrix or to proteoglycan-positive cells induces APRIL oligomerization, which is the prerequisite for the triggering of TACI- and/or BCMA-mediated activation, migration, or survival signals.",,
11486033,Identification of receptor and heparin binding sites in fibroblast growth factor 4 by structure-based mutagenesis.,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) comprise a large family of multifunctional, heparin-binding polypeptides that show diverse patterns of interaction with a family of receptors (FGFR1 to -4) that are subject to alternative splicing. FGFR binding specificity is an essential mechanism in the regulation of FGF signaling and is achieved through primary sequence differences among FGFs and FGFRs and through usage of two alternative exons, IIIc and IIIb, for the second half of immunoglobulin-like domain 3 (D3) in FGFRs. While FGF4 binds and activates the IIIc splice forms of FGFR1 to -3 at comparable levels, it shows little activity towards the IIIb splice forms of FGFR1 to -3 as well as towards FGFR4. To begin to explore the structural determinants for this differential affinity, we determined the crystal structure of FGF4 at a 1.8-A resolution. FGF4 adopts a beta-trefoil fold similar to other FGFs. To identify potential receptor and heparin binding sites in FGF4, a ternary FGF4-FGFR1-heparin model was constructed by superimposing the FGF4 structure onto FGF2 in the FGF2-FGFR1-heparin structure. Mutation of several key residues in FGF4, observed to interact with FGFR1 or with heparin in the model, produced ligands with reduced receptor binding and concomitant low mitogenic potential. Based on the modeling and mutational data, we propose that FGF4, like FGF2, but unlike FGF1, engages the betaC'-betaE loop in D3 and thus can differentiate between the IIIc and IIIb splice isoforms of FGFRs for binding. Moreover, we show that FGF4 needs to interact with both the 2-O- and 6-O-sulfates in heparin to exert its optimal biological activity.",,
11733378,Identification of receptor-binding sites of monocyte chemotactic S19 ribosomal protein dimer.,"The S19 ribosomal protein (RP S19) cross-linked homo-dimer attracts monocyte migration by binding to C5a receptor on monocytes (H Nishiura, Y Shibuya, T Yamamoto, Laboratory Investigation, 1998, 78:1615-1623). Using site-directed mutants of recombinant RP S19 and synthetic peptides mimicking RP S19 molecular regions, we currently identified the binding sites of the RP S19 dimer to the C5a receptor. The RP S19 dimer activated the receptor by a two-step binding mechanism as in the case of C5a. The first binding site was a basic cluster region containing a -Lys41-His42-Lys43- sequence. The second one was the -Leu131-Asp132-Arg133- moiety, localized 12 residues upstream from the COOH-terminal. The second binding triggered the chemotactic response. The first binding would have a role in achieving a high-binding affinity between the ligand and receptor. The first and second ligand-binding sites of C5a receptor seem to be shared by C5a and the RP S19 dimer, although overall homology between the amino acid sequences of these ligands is only 4%.",,
16049014,Identification of receptors and signaling pathways for orphan bone morphogenetic protein/growth differentiation factor ligands based on genomic analyses.,"There are more than 30 human transforming growth factor beta/bone morphogenetic protein/growth differentiation factor (TGFbeta/BMP/GDF)-related ligands known to be important during embryonic development, organogenesis, bone formation, reproduction, and other physiological processes. Although select TGFbeta/BMP/GDF proteins were found to interact with type II and type I serine/threonine receptors to activate downstream Smad and other proteins, the receptors and signaling pathways for one-third of these TGFbeta/BMP/GDF paralogs are still unclear. Based on a genomic analysis of the entire repertoire of TGFbeta/BMP/GDF ligands and serine/threonine kinase receptors, we tested the ability of three orphan BMP/GDF ligands to activate a limited number of phylogenetically related receptors. We characterized the dimeric nature of recombinant GDF6 (also known as BMP13), GDF7 (also known as BMP12), and BMP10. We demonstrated their bioactivities based on the activation of Smad1/5/8-, but not Smad2/3-, responsive promoter constructs in the MC3T3 cell line. Furthermore, we showed their ability to induce the phosphorylation of Smad1, but not Smad2, in these cells. In COS7 cells transfected with the seven known type I receptors, overexpression of ALK3 or ALK6 conferred ligand signaling by GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10. In contrast, transfection of MC3T3 cells with ALK3 small hairpin RNA suppressed Smad signaling induced by all three ligands. Based on the coevolution of ligands and receptors, we also tested the role of BMPRII and ActRIIA as the type II receptor candidates for the three orphan ligands. We found that transfection of small hairpin RNA for BMPRII and ActRIIA in MC3T3 cells suppressed the signaling of GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10. Thus, the present approach provides a genomic paradigm for matching paralogous polypeptide ligands with a limited number of evolutionarily related receptors capable of activating specific downstream Smad proteins.",,
10894543,Identification of receptors for neuromedin U and its role in feeding.,"Neuromedin U (NMU) is a neuropeptide with potent activity on smooth muscle which was isolated first from porcine spinal cord and later from other species. It is widely distributed in the gut and central nervous system. Peripheral activities of NMU include stimulation of smooth muscle, increase of blood pressure, alteration of ion transport in the gut, control of local blood flow and regulation of adrenocortical function. An NMU receptor has not been molecularly identified. Here we show that the previously described orphan G-protein-coupled receptor FM-3 (ref. 15) and a newly discovered one (FM-4) are cognate receptors for NMU. FM-3, designated NMU1R, is abundantly expressed in peripheral tissues whereas FM-4, designated NMU2R, is expressed in specific regions of the brain. NMU is expressed in the ventromedial hypothalamus in the rat brain, and its level is significantly reduced following fasting. Intracerebroventricular administration of NMU markedly suppresses food intake in rats. These findings provide a molecular basis for the biochemical activities of NMU and may indicate that NMU is involved in the central control of feeding.",Nature,2000
10880230,Identification of regions within the third FnIII-like domain of the IL-5Ralpha involved in IL-5 interaction.,"Previously, two binding sites for interleukin 5 (IL-5) were identified on the IL-5 receptor alpha chain (IL-5Ralpha). They are located within the CD loop of the first fibronectin type III (FnIII)-like domain and the EF loop of the second FnIII-like domain. The first binding site was identified by exploiting the different abilities of human IL-5Ralpha (hIL-5Ralpha) and mouse IL-5Ralpha (mIL-5Ralpha) to bind hIL-5. Here we show that ovine IL-5 (oIL-5) has the ability to activate the hIL-5Ralpha but not the mIL-5Ralpha. By using chimeras of the mIL-5Ralpha and hIL-5Ralpha we demonstrate that residues within the first and third FnIII-like domains of mIL-5Ralpha are responsible for this lack of activity. Furthermore, mutation of residues on hIL-5Ralpha to mIL-5Ralpha within the predicted DE and FG loop regions of the third FnIII domain reduces oIL-5 activity. These results show that regions of the third FnIII domain of IL-5Ralpha are involved in binding, in addition to the regions in domains one and two of the IL-5Ralpha that were identified in an earlier study.",Cytokine,2000
14522967,Identification of relaxin-3/INSL7 as a ligand for GPCR142.,"We have recently identified the insulin-like peptide relaxin-3 (aka INSL7) as the endogenous ligand for an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, GPCR135 (aka somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor). Analysis of possible receptors related to GPCR135 revealed a single orphan receptor, GPCR142. Thus, we tested whether GPCR142 could also respond to relaxin-3 or related insulin-like molecules. Surprisingly, GPCR142 was activated by nanomolar concentrations of relaxin-3 but was completely unresponsive to all other known insulin-like peptides. We evaluated by reverse transcriptase-PCR the expression of GPCR142 mRNA in a variety of human tissues and found expression in brain, kidney, testis, thymus, placenta, prostate, salivary gland, thyroid, and colon. In an analysis of other species, we were able to find a full-length mouse homolog of GPCR142, but were unable to detect any complete GPCR142 transcripts in rat. With respect to intracellular signaling, GPCR142 is similar to GPCR135 in that it potently inhibits adenylate cyclase and stimulates 35S-GTPgammaS incorporation in response to relaxin-3. However, whereas GPCR135 signaling could be converted to calcium mobilization using a Gqi5 or Galpha16 G-proteins, GPCR142 was only capable of functioning in the presence of Galpha16. In the accompanying article (Liu, C., Eriste, E., Sutton, S., Chen, J., Roland, B., Kuei, C., Farmer, N., Jörnvall, H., Sillard, R., and Lovenberg, T. W. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 50754-50764), we present the case that relaxin-3, which has previously been shown to bind to the relaxin receptor LGR7, is most likely the endogenous ligand for GPCR135. In this report, we show an additional receptor, GPCR142, which is also selectively activated by relaxin-3. However, the anatomical localization of GPCR142 suggests that GPCR142 may have different physiological functions.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
14522968,Identification of relaxin-3/INSL7 as an endogenous ligand for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPCR135.,"GPCR135, publicly known as somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor, is expressed in the central nervous system and its cognate ligand(s) has not been identified. We have found that both rat and porcine brain extracts stimulated 35S-labeled guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) incorporation in cells over-expressing GPCR135. Multiple rounds of extraction, purification, followed by N-terminal sequence analysis of the ligand from porcine brain revealed that the ligand is a product of the recently identified gene, relaxin-3 (aka insulin-7 or INSL7). Recombinant human relaxin-3 potently stimulates GTPgammaS binding and inhibits cAMP accumulation in GPCR135 overexpressing cells with EC50 values of 0.25 and 0.35 nM, respectively. 125I-Relaxin-3 binds GPCR135 at high affinity with a Kd value of 0.31 nM. Relaxin-3 is the only member of the insulin/relaxin superfamily that can activate GPCR135. In situ hybridization showed that relaxin-3 mRNA is predominantly expressed in the dorsomedial ventral tegmental nucleus of the brainstem (aka nucleus incertus), as well as in discrete cells in the lateral periaqueductal gray and in the central gray nucleus. GPCR135 is expressed abundantly in the hypothalamus with discrete expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and supraoptic nucleus, as well as in the cortex, septal nucleus, and preoptical area. Relaxin-3 has previously been shown to bind and activate the LGR7 relaxin receptor. However, we believe that neuroanatomical colocalization of GPCR135 and relaxin-3, coupled with a clear high affinity interaction, suggest that GPCR135 is the receptor for relaxin-3. The identification of relaxin-3 as the ligand for GPCR135 provides the framework for the discovery of a new brainstem/hypothalamus circuitry.",,
10950949,Identification of residues important both for primary receptor binding and specificity in fibroblast growth factor-7.,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes by activating a family of tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
10529171,"Identification of residues in the monocyte chemotactic protein-1 that contact the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2.","The CC chemokine, MCP-1, has been identified as a major chemoattractant for T cells and monocytes, and plays a significant role in the pathology of inflammatory diseases. To identify the regions of MCP-1 that contact its receptor, CCR2, we substituted all surface-exposed residues with alanine. Some residues were also mutated to other amino acids to identify the importance of charge, hydrophobicity, or aromaticity at specific positions. The binding affinity of each mutant for CCR2 was assayed with THP-1 and CCR2-transfected CHL cells. The majority of point mutations had no effect. Residues at the N-terminus of the protein, known to be crucial for signaling, contribute less than a factor of 10 to the binding affinity. However, two clusters of primarily basic residues (R24, K35, K38, K49, and Y13), separated by a 35 A hydrophobic groove, reduced the level of binding by 15-100-fold. A peptide fragment encompassing residues 13-35 recapitulated some of the mutational data derived from the intact protein. It exhibited modest binding as a linear peptide and dramatically improved affinity when the region which adopts a single turn of a 3(10)-helix in the protein, which includes R24, was constrained by a disulfide bond. Additional constraints at the ends of the peptide, corresponding to the disulfide between the first and third cysteines in MCP-1, yielded further improvements in affinity. Together, these data suggest a model in which a large surface area of MCP-1 contacts the receptor, and the accumulation of a number of weak interactions results in the 35 pM affinity observed for the wild-type (WT) protein. The receptor binding site of MCP-1 also is significantly different from the binding sites of RANTES and IL-8, providing insight into the issue of receptor specificity. It was previously shown that the N-terminus of CCR2 is critical for binding MCP-1 [Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19084-92; Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 23186-90]. Point mutations of six acidic residues in this region of the receptor were made to test their role in ligand binding. This identified D25 and D27 of the DYDY motif as being important. On the basis of our data, we propose a model in which the receptor N-terminus lies along the hydrophobic groove in an extended fashion, placing the DYDY motif near the basic cluster involving R24 and K49 of MCP-1. This in turn orients the signaling residues (Y13 and the N-terminus) for productive interaction with the receptor.",Biochemistry,1999
9988761,"Identification of residues within the 727-767 segment of human complement component C3 important for its interaction with factor H and with complement receptor 1 (CR1, CD35).","Mapping approaches employing blocking antibodies and synthetic peptides have implicated the 727-767 segment at the NH2 terminus of C3b alpha'-chain as contributing to the interactions with factor B, factor H, and CR1. Our previous mutagenesis study on the NH2-terminal acidic cluster of this segment identified residues Glu-736 and Glu-737 as contributing to the binding of C3b to factor B and CR1 but not factor H. We have now extended the charged residue mutagenic scan to cover the remainder of the segment (738-767) and have assessed the ability of the C3b-like C3(H2O) form of the mutant molecules to interact with factor H, CR1, and membrane cofactor protein (MCP) using a cofactor-dependent factor I cleavage assay as a surrogate binding assay. We have found that the negatively charged side chains of Glu-744 and Glu-747 are important for the interaction between C3(H2O) and factor H, a result in general agreement with an earlier synthetic peptide study (Fishelson, Z. (1991) Mol. Immunol. 28, 545-552) which implicated residues within the 744-754 segment in H binding. The interactions of the mutants with soluble CR1 (sCR1) revealed two classes of residues. The first are residues required for sCR1 to be an I cofactor for the first two cleavages of alpha-chain. These are all acidic residues and include the Glu-736/Glu-737 pair, Glu-747, and the Glu-754/Asp-755 pairing. The second class affects only the ability of sCR1 to be a cofactor for the third factor I cleavage and include Glu-744 and the Lys-757/Glu-758 pairing. The dominance of acidic residues in the loss-of-function mutants is striking and suggests that H and CR1 contribute basic residues to the interface. Additionally, although there is partial overlap, the contacts required for CR1 binding appear to extend over a wider portion of the 727-767 segment than is the case for factor H. Finally, none of the mutations had any effect on the interaction between soluble MCP and C3(H2O), indicating that despite its functional homology to H and CR1, MCP differs in its mode of binding to C3b/C3(H2O).",,
9632725,Identification of single C motif-1/lymphotactin receptor XCR1.,"Single C motif-1 (SCM-1)/lymphotactin is a member of the chemokine superfamily, but retains only the 2nd and 4th of the four cysteine residues conserved in other chemokines. In humans, there are two highly homologous SCM-1 genes encoding SCM-1alpha and SCM-1beta with two amino acid substitutions. To identify a specific receptor for SCM-1 proteins, we produced recombinant SCM-1alpha and SCM-1beta by the baculovirus expression system and tested them on murine L1.2 cells stably expressing eight known chemokine receptors and three orphan receptors. Both proteins specifically induced migration in cells expressing an orphan receptor, GPR5. The migration was chemotactic and suppressed by pertussis toxin, indicating coupling to a Galpha type of G protein. Both proteins also induced intracellular calcium mobilization in GPR5-expressing L1.2 cells with efficient mutual cross desensitization. SCM-1alpha bound specifically to GPR5-expressing L1.2 cells with a Kd of 10 nM. By Northern blot analysis, GPR5 mRNA of about 5 kilobases was detected strongly in placenta and weakly in spleen and thymus among various human tissues. Identification of a specific receptor for SCM-1 would facilitate our investigation on its biological function. Following the set rule for the chemokine receptor nomenclature, we propose to designate GPR5 as XCR1 from XC chemokine receptor-1.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
8086489,Identification of specific regions of the human endothelin-B receptor required for high affinity binding with endothelin-3.,"To investigate the endothelin-3 (ET-3) binding region of the endothelin-B (ETB) receptor, we have transiently produced various chimeric endothelin receptors in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Using 125I-ET-1 as the radioactive ligand in the displacement experiment, the replacement of both the second and third extracellular regions including the flanking transmembranes of the ETB receptor with the corresponding domains of the endothelin-A (ETA) receptor, increased the apparent Ki value for ET-3 from 5 x 10(-11) M to 10(-8) M. The affinity of this chimeric receptor, ETB-BC, for ET-3 was about two orders lower than ETB yet one order higher than ETA. Previously we have reported the involvement of Lys-140 located in the C-terminus of the second transmembrane region of the ETA receptor for ET-1 binding (Eur. J. Biochem., 220, 37-43, 1994). To assess the importance of the corresponding Lys-161 of the ETB receptor in ET-3 binding, we have replaced it with Ile in the ETB receptor. The mutant receptor had a 5.6-fold reduction in its affinity for ET-3, but its affinity for ET-1 remained similar. These results demonstrate that Lys-161 of the receptor is important for high affinity binding with ET-3 which, in part, confers the non-selective binding characteristics of the ETB receptor for ET isopeptides.",,
10770925,Identification of the binding site for a novel class of CCR2b chemokine receptor antagonists: binding to a common chemokine receptor motif within the helical bundle.,"Monocyte chemoattracant-1 (MCP-1) stimulates leukocyte chemotaxis to inflammatory sites, such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and asthma, by use of the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2, a member of the G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor superfamily. These studies identified a family of antagonists, spiropiperidines. One of the more potent compounds blocks MCP-1 binding to CCR2 with a K(d) of 60 nm, but it is unable to block binding to CXCR1, CCR1, or CCR3. These compounds were effective inhibitors of chemotaxis toward MCP-1 but were very poor inhibitors of CCR1-mediated chemotaxis. The compounds are effective blockers of MCP-1-driven inhibition of adenylate cyclase and MCP-1- and MCP-3-driven cytosolic calcium influx; the compounds are not agonists for these pathways. We showed that glutamate 291 (Glu(291)) of CCR2 is a critical residue for high affinity binding and that this residue contributes little to MCP-1 binding to CCR2. The basic nitrogen present in the spiropiperidine compounds may be the interaction partner for Glu(291), because the basicity of this nitrogen was essential for affinity; furthermore, a different class of antagonists, a class that does not have a basic nitrogen (2-carboxypyrroles), were not affected by mutations of Glu(291). In addition to the CCR2 receptor, spiropiperidine compounds have affinity for several biogenic amine receptors. Receptor models indicate that the acidic residue, Glu(291), from transmembrane-7 of CCR2 is in a position similar to the acidic residue contributed from transmembrane-3 of biogenic amine receptors, which may account for the shared affinity of spiropiperidines for these two receptor classes. The models suggest that the acid-base pair, Glu(291) to piperidine nitrogen, anchors the spiropiperidine compound within the transmembrane ovoid bundle. This binding site may overlap with the space required by MCP-1 during binding and signaling; thus the small molecule ligands act as antagonists. An acidic residue in transmembrane region 7 is found in most chemokine receptors and is rare in other serpentine receptors. The model of the binding site may suggest ways to make new small molecule chemokine receptor antagonists, and it may rationalize the design of more potent and selective antagonists.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
12244066,Identification of the binding site for the Lutheran blood group glycoprotein on laminin alpha 5 through expression of chimeric laminin chains in vivo.,"The Lutheran blood group glycoprotein (Lu), also known as basal cell adhesion molecule, is an Ig superfamily transmembrane receptor for laminin alpha5. Lu is expressed on the surface of a subset of muscle and epithelial cells in diverse tissues and is thought to be involved in both normal and disease processes, including sickle cell disease and cancer. Here we investigated the binding of Lu to laminin alpha5 in vivo and in vitro. We prepared a soluble recombinant Lu (sol-Lu) composed of the Lu extracellular domain and a His(6) tag. Sol-Lu bound specifically to laminin-10/11 (alpha5beta1/beta2gamma1) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and bound to bona fide basement membranes containing laminin alpha5 in tissue sections. Sol-Lu did not bind to tissue sections of laminin alpha5 knockout embryos, despite the fact that the four other alpha chains were present. To identify the Lu-binding site on laminin alpha5, we prepared modified alpha5 cDNAs encoding chimeric laminins containing all or part of the laminin alpha1 G domain in place of the analogous alpha5 regions. These constructs were used to generate transgenic mice. Proteins derived from transgenes were detected in basement membranes and were assayed for their ability to bind Lu by examining the localization of endogenous Lu and the binding of sol-Lu applied to tissue sections. Our results demonstrate that the alpha5 LG3 module is essential for Lu binding to laminin alpha5.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
9521068,Identification of the CC chemokines TARC and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta as novel functional ligands for the CCR8 receptor.,"Chemokines are key molecules in directing leukocyte migration toward sites of inflammation. We have previously cloned a putative CC chemokine receptor gene, TER1, whose expression is restricted to lymphoid tissues and cell lines. Recently, this receptor has been shown to signal in response to the human CC chemokine I-309 and thus it has been renamed CCR8 according to the current nomenclature. In the present study, we report the identification of the CC chemokines thymus and activation-regulated cytokine (TARC) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1 beta) as CCR8 ligands, as they induce chemotaxis in CCR8 Jurkat stable transfectants. Furthermore, we have generated a polyclonal antiserum that is able to recognize the CCR8 molecule in transfectant lysates. The pattern of CCR8 mRNA expression and the functional effects exerted by its ligand suggest that the triggering of this receptor may regulate multiple functions including activation, migration and proliferation of lymphoid cells.",European journal of immunology,1998
11035029,"Identification of the functional interleukin-22 (IL-22) receptor complex: the IL-10R2 chain (IL-10Rbeta ) is a common chain of both the IL-10 and IL-22 (IL-10-related T cell-derived inducible factor, IL-TIF) receptor complexes.","Interleukin-10 (IL-10)-related T cell-derived inducible factor (IL-TIF; provisionally designated IL-22) is a cytokine with limited homology to IL-10. We report here the identification of a functional IL-TIF receptor complex that consists of two receptor chains, the orphan CRF2-9 and IL-10R2, the second chain of the IL-10 receptor complex. Expression of the CRF2-9 chain in monkey COS cells renders them sensitive to IL-TIF. However, in hamster cells both chains, CRF2-9 and IL-10R2, must be expressed to assemble the functional IL-TIF receptor complex. The CRF2-9 chain (or the IL-TIF-R1 chain) is responsible for Stat recruitment. Substitution of the CRF2-9 intracellular domain with the IFN-gammaR1 intracellular domain changes the pattern of IL-TIF-induced Stat activation. The CRF2-9 gene is expressed in normal liver and kidney, suggesting a possible role for IL-TIF in regulating gene expression in these tissues. Each chain, CRF2-9 and IL-10R2, is capable of binding IL-TIF independently and can be cross-linked to the radiolabeled IL-TIF. However, binding of IL-TIF to the receptor complex is greater than binding to either receptor chain alone. Sharing of the common IL-10R2 chain between the IL-10 and IL-TIF receptor complexes is the first such case for receptor complexes with chains belonging to the class II cytokine receptor family, establishing a novel paradigm for IL-10-related ligands similar to the shared use of the gamma common chain (gamma(c)) by several cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15.",,

A 145-kilodalton tyrosyl phosphoprotein observed in rapid response to HGF treatment of intact target cells was identified by immunoblot analysis as the beta subunit of the c-met proto-oncogene product, a membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase. Covalent cross-linking of 125I-labeled ligand to cellular proteins of appropriate size that were recognized by antibodies to c-met directly established the c-met product as the cell-surface receptor for HGF.",,
12684503,Identification of the human receptor activity-modifying protein 1 domains responsible for agonist binding specificity.,"When co-expressed with receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) 1, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) can function as a receptor for both calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (AM). To investigate the structural determinants of ligand binding specificity, we examined the extracellular domain of human (h) RAMP1 using various deletion mutants. Co-expression of the hRAMP1 mutants with hCRLR in HEK-293 cells revealed that deletion of residues 91-94, 96-100, or 101-103 blocked [125I]CGRP binding and completely abolished intracellular cAMP accumulation normally elicited by CGRP or AM. On the other hand, the deletion of residues 78-80 or 88-90 significantly attenuated only AM-evoked responses. In all of these cases, the receptor heterodimers were fully expressed at the cell surface. Substituting alanine for residues 91-103 one at a time had little effect on CGRP-induced responses, indicating that although this segment is essential for high affinity agonist binding to the receptors, none of the residues directly interacts with either CGRP or AM. This finding suggests that RAMPs probably determine ligand specificity by contributing to the structure of the ligand-binding pocket or by allosteric modulation of the conformation of the receptor. Interestingly, the L94A mutant up-regulated surface expression of the receptor heterodimer to a greater degree than wild-type hRAMP1, thereby increasing CGRP binding and signaling. L94A also significantly increased cell surface expression of the hRAMP1 deletion mutant D101-103 when co-transfected with hCRLR, and expression of a L94A/D101-103 double mutant markedly attenuated the activity of endogenous RAMP1 in HEK-293T cells.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
8355686,Identification of the ligand-binding regions in the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor extracellular domain.,"The c-fms gene encodes the receptor for the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and its extracellular domain consists of five immunoglobulin-like subdomains. To identify which of the five immunoglobulin-like regions are involved in ligand binding, we polymerase chain reaction-cloned five segments of the extracellular domain of the murine c-fms gene, each starting with the normal initiation codon and containing successive additions of the immunoglobulin-like subdomains. These protein segments are designated A, B, C, D, and E and contain, from the N-terminal end, either one, two, three, four, or all five immunoglobulin-like subdomains, respectively. Each segment was expressed as a secreted soluble protein from a baculovirus expression vector in Sf9 insect cells. In addition, segments A, B, C, and E were produced as soluble alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins, as was a segment containing only the fourth and fifth immunoglobulin domains. These segments of the Fms extracellular domain were used to assess M-CSF binding by competition radioimmunoassays, plate binding immunoassays, and immunoprecipitation analyses. The results indicated that the first two N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domains did not interact with M-CSF but, in combination with the third immunoglobulin-like domain, provided high-affinity M-CSF binding. The fourth and fifth immunoglobulin-like domains near the cell membrane did not exhibit M-CSF binding and may inhibit interaction of M-CSF with the first three immunoglobulin domains. These results suggest that the three N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domains constitute the high-affinity M-CSF binding region and that the fourth and fifth immunoglobulin-like domains may perform functions other than ligand binding.",Molecular and cellular biology,1993
11241215,Identification of the ligand-binding site of the BMP type IA receptor for BMP-4.,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. BMP induces its signal to regulate growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of various cells upon trimeric complex formation with two distinct type I and type II receptors on the cell surface: both are single-transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. To identify the amino acid residues on BMP type I receptor responsible for its ligand binding, the structure-activity relationship of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the BMP type IA receptor (sBMPR-IA) was investigated by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The mutant receptors, as well as sBMPR-IA, were expressed as fusion proteins with thioredoxin in Escherichia coli, and purified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) after digestion with enterokinase. Structural analysis of the parent protein and representative mutants in solution by CD showed no detectable differences in their folding structures. The binding affinity of the mutants to BMP-4 was determined by surface plasmon resonance biosensor. All the mutant receptors examined, with the exception of Y70A, displayed reduced affinities to BMP-4 with the rank order of decreases: I52A (17-fold) approximately F75A (15-fold) >> T64A (4-fold) = T62A (4-fold) approximately E54A (3-fold). The decreases in binding affinity observed for the latter three mutants are mainly due to decreased association rate constants while alterations in rate constants both, for association and dissociation, result in the drastically reduced affinities for the former two mutants. These results allow us to conclude that sBMPR-IA recognizes the ligand using the concave face of the molecule. The major ligand-binding site of the BMP type IA receptor consists of Phe75 in loop 2 and Ile52, Glu54, Thr62 and Thr64 on the three-stranded beta-sheet. These findings should provide a general basis for the ligand/type I receptor recognition in the TGF-beta superfamily.",Biopolymers,2000
7775583,Identification of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) as an endocytic receptor for thrombospondin-1.,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) has potent biological effects on vasculature smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells. The regulation of extracellular accumulation of TSP1 is mediated by a previously obscure process of endocytosis which leads to its lysosomal degradation. Since members of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family have been found to mediate endocytosis which leads to degradation of a diverse array of ligands, we evaluated their possible role in the uptake and degradation of TSP1 by vascular SMCs, endothelial-cells and fibroblasts. 125I-TSP1 was found to be internalized and degraded lysosomally by all these cell types. Both the internalization and degradation of 125I-TSP1 could be inhibited by a specific antagonist of the LDLR family, the 39-kD receptor-associated protein (RAP). Antibodies to the LDLR-related protein (LRP) completely blocked the uptake and degradation of 125I-TSP1 in SMCs and fibroblasts but not endothelial cells. Solid-phase binding assays confirmed that LRP bound to TSP1 and that the interaction was of high affinity (Kd = 5 nM). Neither RAP nor LRP antibodies inhibited the binding of 125I-TSP1 to surfaces of SMCs. However, cell surface binding, as well as, endocytosis and degradation could be blocked by heparin or by pre-treatment of the cells with either heparitinase, chondroitinase or beta-D-xyloside. The data indicates that cell surface proteoglycans are involved in the LRP-mediated clearance of TSP1. A model for the clearance of TSP1 by these cells is that TSP1 bound to proteoglycans is presented to LRP for endocytosis. In endothelial cells, however, the internalization of TSP1 was not mediated by LRP but since RAP inhibited TSP1 uptake and degradation, we postulate that another member of the LDLR family is likely to be involved.",The Journal of cell biology,1995
8939948,"Identification of the product of growth arrest-specific gene 6 as a common ligand for Axl, Sky, and Mer receptor tyrosine kinases.","Axl, Sky, and Mer, members of an Axl/Sky receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily, are typified by the cell adhesion molecule-related extracellular domain. The product of growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6), structurally homologous to the anticoagulant protein S, was recently identified as the ligand for Axl and Sky, but the ligand for Mer remained unknown. We have now obtained evidence that Gas6 can also function as a ligand for Mer. Co-precipitation analysis, using soluble receptors of Axl, Sky, and Mer (Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc) composed of the extracellular domain of receptors fused to the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G1, clearly showed that Gas6, but not protein S, specifically bound to Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc fusion proteins. Quantitative kinetic analyses using a BIAcore biosensor instrument revealed dissociation constants (Kd) of the binding of rat Gas6 to Axl-Fc, Sky-Fc, and Mer-Fc are 0.4, 2.7, and 29 nM, respectively. We also found that Gas6 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Axl, Sky, and Mer receptors ectopically expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that Gas6 is a common ligand for Axl, Sky, and Mer, all known members of an Axl/Sky receptor subfamily.",,
11099506,Identification of the protein C/activated protein C binding sites on the endothelial cell protein C receptor. Implications for a novel mode of ligand recognition by a major histocompatibility complex class 1-type receptor.,"The endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) is an endothelial cell-specific transmembrane protein that binds both protein C and activated protein C (APC). EPCR regulates the protein C anticoagulant pathway by binding protein C and augmenting protein C activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. EPCR is homologous to the MHC class 1/CD1 family, members of which contain two alpha-helices that sit upon an 8-stranded beta-sheet platform. In this study, we identified 10 residues that, when mutated to alanine, result in the loss of protein C/APC binding (Arg-81, Leu-82, Val-83, Glu-86, Arg-87, Phe-146, Tyr-154, Thr-157, Arg-158, and Glu-160). Glutamine substitutions at the four N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites of EPCR have little affect on APC binding, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties of EPCR are not critical for ligand recognition. We then mapped the epitopes for four anti-human EPCR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), two of which block EPCR/Fl-APC (APC labeled at the active site with fluorescein) interactions, whereas two do not. These epitopes were localized by generating human-mouse EPCR chimeric proteins, since the mAbs under investigation do not recognize mouse EPCR. We found that 5 of the 10 candidate residues for protein C/APC binding (Arg-81, Leu-82, Val-83, Glu-86, Arg-87) colocalize with the epitope for one of the blocking mAbs. Three-dimensional molecular modeling of EPCR indicates that the 10 protein C/APC binding candidate residues are clustered at the distal end of the two alpha-helical segments. Protein C activation studies on 293 cells that coexpress EPCR variants and thrombomodulin demonstrate that protein C binding to EPCR is necessary for the EPCR-dependent enhancement in protein activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. These studies indicate that EPCR has exploited the MHC class 1 fold for an alternative and possibly novel mode of ligand recognition. These studies are also the first to identify the protein C/APC binding region of EPCR and may provide useful information about molecular defects in EPCR that could contribute to cardiovascular disease susceptibility.",,
30552345,Identification of the salusin-β receptor using proteoliposomes embedded with endogenous membrane proteins.,"Although orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been used as targets to discover unidentified natural ligands, increasing numbers of non-GPCRs have been found to mediate important biological functions. Bioinformatics of genome and cDNA resources predict putative bioactive peptides, demanding an alternative approach to efficiently unravel cell surface targets. In silico analysis of a full-length cDNA library previously allowed us to identify salusin-β, a parasympathomimetic/pro-atherosclerotic peptide with unique physicochemical properties. Here, we show that the β-chain of ATP synthase is a cell surface receptor for salusin-β by utilizing artificial liposomes embedded with endogenous membrane proteins directly transferred from animal tissues while retaining the ligand-binding capability. Conventional techniques using detergents identified a β-actin-profilin complex as membrane-associated salusin-β-binding proteins, but failed to identify the cell surface receptor. Since the α-chain of ATP synthase is a principal cell surface target for angiostatin, a potent endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, we investigated whether salusin-β modulates angiogenesis. Salusin-β inhibited cell surface ATP synthase activity and prevented sarcoma cell-induced angiogenesis in an in vivo mouse air sac model. Therefore, salusin-β binds to membrane-bound ATP synthase and acts as an angiogenesis inhibitor. The current methodology allows the identification of novel cell surface targets, irrespective of the receptor structure.",Scientific reports,2018
9006937,Identification of two amino acids of the human cholecystokinin-A receptor that interact with the N-terminal moiety of cholecystokinin.,"A region between residues 38 and 42 of the human cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) receptor was shown to be involved in the binding of CCK but not in that of JMV 179 and JMV 180, two peptides closely related to CCK (Kennedy, K., Escrieut, C., Dufresne, M., Clerc, P., Vaysse, N., and Fourmy, D. (1995) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 213, 845-852). In the present study, we have identified the residues of both the receptor and the ligand responsible for this differential binding. Residues Trp-39 and Gln-40 of the receptor were crucial for binding of the C-terminal nonapeptide of CCK as W39F and Q40N mutants demonstrated parallel decreases in both affinity and potency to induce accumulation of inositol phosphates (12.9- and 20.9-fold). The W39F and Q40N mutant receptors bound CCK analogues modified at their C-terminal end, including JMV 179 and JMV 180, as well as the C-terminal amidated heptapeptide of CCK, with identical affinities to the wild-type receptor. In contrast, W39F and Q40N mutants bound CCK octapeptide with the same decreased affinity as the CCK nonapeptide. The modeling of the CCK-A receptor and the docking of the peptide agonists [Thr,Nle]CCK9 and CCK-8 indicated that their N terminus was connected to the receptor through a strong bond network involving Trp-39 and Gln-40 thus confirming experimental data. These first molecular data identifying the agonist binding site of the human CCK-A receptor represent an important step toward the complete delineation of the agonist binding site and the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern differential activation of this receptor by CCK-related peptides.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
9326293,Identification of two corticotropin-releasing factor receptors from Xenopus laevis with high ligand selectivity: unusual pharmacology of the type 1 receptor.,"Two cDNA clones encoding distinct members of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor family have been isolated from Xenopus laevis with PCR-based approaches. The first full-length cDNA amplified from Xenopus brain encoded a 415-amino acid protein with approximately 80% identity to mammalian CRF receptor type 1 (CRF-R1). The second full-length cDNA isolated from Xenopus brain and heart encoded a 413-amino acid protein with approximately 81% identity to the alpha-variant of mammalian CRF receptor, type 2 (CRF-R2). No evidence could be obtained that the beta-variant of CRF-R2 existed in Xenopus laevis. Binding studies using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells stably transfected with xenopus CRF-R2 showed that the CRF analogues urotensin I, urocortin, and sauvagine were bound with higher affinities than human/rat CRF, xenopus CRF, and ovine CRF. In contrast to human CRF-R1, xenopus CRF-R1 (xCRF-R1) was very selective for different CRF ligands. Urotensin I, urocortin, human/rat CRF, and xenopus CRF were bound with significantly (10-22-fold) higher affinities than ovine CRF (K(D) = 31.7 nM) and sauvagine (K(D) = 51.4 nM). In agreement with these binding data, EC50 values of 39.7 and 1.1 nM were found for sauvagine and for human/rat CRF or xenopus CRF, respectively, when the cyclic AMP production in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with xCRF-R1 was determined.",,
8702914,Identification of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors for growth/differentiation factor-5.,"Growth/differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5) is a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, which plays an important role in bone development in vivo. Mutations in the GDF-5 gene result in brachypodism in mice and Hunter-Thompson type chondrodysplasia in human. BMPs transduce their effects through binding to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II. However, binding abilities appear to be different among the members of the BMP family. BMP-4 binds to two different type I receptors, BMP receptors type IA (BMPR-IA) and type IB (BMPR-IB), and a type II receptor, BMP receptor type II (BMPR-II). In addition to these receptors, osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1, also known as BMP-7) binds to activin type I receptor (ActR-I) as well as activin type II receptors (ActR-II and ActR-IIB). Here we investigate the binding and signaling properties of GDF-5 through type I and type II receptors. GDF-5 induced alkaline phosphatase activity in a rat osteoprogenitor-like cell line, ROB-C26. 125I-GDF-5 bound to BMPR-IB and BMPR-II but not to BMPR-IA in ROB-C26 cells and other nontransfected cell lines. Analysis using COS-1 cells transfected with the receptor cDNAs revealed that GDF-5 bound to BMPR-IB but not to the other type I receptors when expressed alone. When COS-1 cells were transfected with type II receptor cDNAs, GDF-5 bound to ActR-II, ActR-IIB, and BMPR-II but not to transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor. In the presence of type II receptors, GDF-5 bound to different sets of type I receptors, but the binding was most efficient to BMPR-IB compared with the other type I receptors. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was efficiently transduced by BMPR-IB in the presence of BMPR-II or ActR-II after stimulation by GDF-5. These results suggest that BMPR-IB mediates certain signals for GDF-5 after forming the heteromeric complex with BMPR-II or ActR-II.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
8006002,Identification of type I receptors for osteogenic protein-1 and bone morphogenetic protein-4.,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are multifunctional proteins, structurally related to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and activin. TGF-beta and activin exert their effects by forming heteromeric complexes of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. We have previously identified a series of type I serine/threonine kinase receptors, termed activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-1 to -6. ALK-5 is a TGF-beta type I receptor, whereas ALK-2 and ALK-4 are activin type I receptors. Here we investigated the binding of proteins in the BMP family to ALKs. In transfected COS cells, the binding of osteogenic protein (OP)-1 and BMP-4 to certain ALKs was observed in the absence of type II receptors, and their binding was increased after co-transfection of a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans, DAF-4. OP-1 bound to ALK-2 and ALK-6 efficiently, and to ALK-3 less efficiently, whereas BMP-4 bound to ALK-3 and ALK-6 efficiently. Similarly, OP-1 bound to ALK-2, ALK-3, and/or ALK-6 in various nontransfected cell lines, although the binding profiles were different between different cell types. BMP-4 bound to ALK-3 in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and human foreskin fibroblasts. These results suggest that ALK-3 and ALK-6 are type I receptors for OP-1 and BMP-4; in addition, ALK-2 is a type I receptor shared by activin and OP-1, but not by BMP-4.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1994
12695525,"Identification of tyrosine 189 and asparagine 358 of the cholecystokinin 2 receptor in direct interaction with the crucial C-terminal amide of cholecystokinin by molecular modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and structure/affinity studies.","The cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors CCK1R and CCK2R exert important central and peripheral functions by binding the neuropeptide cholecystokinin. Because these receptors are potential therapeutic targets, great interest has been devoted to the identification of efficient ligands that selectively activate or inhibit these receptors. A complete mapping of the CCK binding site in these receptors would help to design new CCK ligands and to optimize their properties. In this view, a molecular model of the CCK2R occupied by CCK was built to identify CCK2R residues that interact with CCK functional groups. No such study has yet been reported for the CCK2R. Docking of CCK in the receptor was performed by taking into account our previous mutagenesis data and by using, as constraint, the direct interaction that we demonstrated between His207 in the CCK2R and Asp8 of CCK (Mol Pharmacol 54:364-371, 1998; J Biol Chem 274:23191-23197, 1999). Two residues that had not been revealed in our previous mutagenesis studies, Tyr189 (Y4.60) and Asn358 (N6.55), were identified in interaction via hydrogen bonds with the C-terminal amide of CCK, a crucial functional group of the peptide. Mutagenesis of Tyr189 (Y4.60) and Asn358 (N6.55) as well as structure-affinity studies with modified CCK analogs validated these interactions and the involvement of both residues in the CCK binding site. These results indicate that the present molecular model is an important tool to identify direct contact points between CCK and the CCK2R and to rapidly progress in mapping of the CCK2R binding site. Moreover, comparison of the present CCK2R.CCK molecular model with that of CCK1R.CCK, which we have previously published and validated, clearly argues that the positioning of CCK in these receptors is different.",Molecular pharmacology,2003
11416224,"Identification of urocortin III, an additional member of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family with high affinity for the CRF2 receptor.","The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family of neuropeptides includes the mammalian peptides CRF, urocortin, and urocortin II, as well as piscine urotensin I and frog sauvagine. The mammalian peptides signal through two G protein-coupled receptor types to modulate endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stress, as well as a range of peripheral (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and immune) activities. The three previously known ligands are differentially distributed anatomically and have distinct specificities for the two major receptor types. Here we describe the characterization of an additional CRF-related peptide, urocortin III, in the human and mouse. In searching the public human genome databases we found a partial expressed sequence tagged (EST) clone with significant sequence identity to mammalian and fish urocortin-related peptides. By using primers based on the human EST sequence, a full-length human clone was isolated from genomic DNA that encodes a protein that includes a predicted putative 38-aa peptide structurally related to other known family members. With a human probe, we then cloned the mouse ortholog from a genomic library. Human and mouse urocortin III share 90% identity in the 38-aa putative mature peptide. In the peptide coding region, both human and mouse urocortin III are 76% identical to pufferfish urocortin-related peptide and more distantly related to urocortin II, CRF, and urocortin from other mammalian species. Mouse urocortin III mRNA expression is found in areas of the brain including the hypothalamus, amygdala, and brainstem, but is not evident in the cerebellum, pituitary, or cerebral cortex; it is also expressed peripherally in small intestine and skin. Urocortin III is selective for type 2 CRF receptors and thus represents another potential endogenous ligand for these receptors.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2001
10581185,Identification of urotensin II as the endogenous ligand for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR14.,"Urotensin II (UII) is a neuropeptide with potent cardiovascular effects. Its sequence is strongly conserved among different species and has structural similarity to somatostatin. No receptor for UII has been molecularly identified from any species so far. GPR14 was cloned as an orphan G protein-coupled receptor with similarity to members of the somatostatin/opioid receptor family. We have now demonstrated that GPR14 is a high affinity receptor for UII and designate it UII-R1a. HEK293 cells and COS-7 cells transfected with rat GPR14 showed strong, dose-dependent calcium mobilization in response to fish, frog, and human UII. Radioligand binding analysis showed high affinity binding of UII to membrane preparations isolated from HEK293 cells stably expressing rat GPR14. In situ hybridization analysis showed that GPR14 was expressed in motor neurons of the spinal cord, smooth muscle cells of the bladder, and muscle cells of the heart. The identification of the first receptor for UII will allow better understanding of the physiological and pharmacological roles of UII.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1999
14550283,Identification of urotensin II-related peptide as the urotensin II-immunoreactive molecule in the rat brain.,"Urotensin II (UII) has been reported as the most potent known vasoconstrictor. While rat and mouse orthologs of UII precursor protein have been reported, only the tentative structures of UII peptides of these animals have been demonstrated, since prepro-UII proteins lack typical processing sites for their mature peptides. In the present study, we isolated a novel peptide, UII-related peptide (URP), from the extract of the rat brain as the sole immunoreactive substance to anti-UII antibody; the amino acid sequence of the peptide was determined as ACFWKYCV. cDNAs encoding rat, mouse, and human precursor proteins for URP were cloned and revealed that the sequences of mouse and human URP peptides are the same as that for rat URP. Prepro-URP gene is expressed in several rat tissues such as those of the thymus, spleen, testis, and spinal cord, although with lower levels than the prepro-UII gene. In the human, the prepro-URP gene is expressed comparably to prepro-UII in several tissues except the spinal cord. URP was found to bind and activate the human or rat UII receptors (GPR14) and showed a hypotensive effect when administered to anesthetized rats. These results suggest that URP is the endogenous and functional ligand for UII receptor in the rat and mouse, and possibly in the human. We also describe the preparation of specific monoclonal antibodies raised against UII peptide and the establishment of a highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay system for UII peptides.",,
12847263,Identification of uteroglobin-related protein 1 and macrophage scavenger receptor with collagenous structure as a lung-specific ligand-receptor pair.,"High in normal (HIN)-1 is a secreted protein highly expressed in normal breast epithelium and down-regulated in breast carcinomas. By searching GenBank expressed sequence tag databases, we identified HIN-2, a protein homologous to HIN-1. HIN-2 is identical with a recently identified protein called uteroglobin-related protein 1 (UGRP1). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that UGRP1 is specifically expressed by lung, but not by the other tissues examined. By in situ hybridization experiments, UGRP1 was shown to be expressed by lung Clara-like cells in the bronchial epithelium and to be up-regulated in cystic fibrosis. In a mammalian expression system, secreted recombinant UGRP1 was copurified with apolipoprotein A-I. Using a retroviral vector-mediated expression cloning approach, we identified macrophage scavenger receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) as a receptor for UGRP1. Northern blot and in situ hybridization experiments indicated that MARCO is expressed by alveolar macrophages in the lung. UGRP1 also bound to bacteria and yeast. LPS, a previously identified MARCO ligand, competed with UGRP1 for binding to MARCO and bacteria. Our findings suggest that UGRP1-MARCO is a ligand-receptor pair that is probably involved in inflammation and pathogen clearance in the lung.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2003
8621427,Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor determinants for binding KDR and FLT-1 receptors. Generation of receptor-selective VEGF variants by site-directed mutagenesis.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.",,

6289330,Identity of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor with glycoprotein SA-7: evidence for differential phosphorylation of the two components of the EGF receptor from A431 cells.,"A 165-kilodalton (kDal) surface glycoprotein encoded by human chromosome 7 (SA-7) had been characterized by using antisera raised against human chromosome 7-containing somatic cell hybrids. We now present evidence that SA-7 is the human receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and that these antisera recognize human-specific determinants. The gene coding for the human EGF receptor is localized to the p12 to p22 region of chromosome 7. We have characterized the 145-kDal/165-kDal EGF receptor doublet of A431 cells after immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled cell extracts with these antisera. We find that a protein with endogenous kinase activity copurifies with the A431 receptor doublet and that both components of the doublet contain phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine and the 165-kDal component contains phosphoserine as well. Further, although each component of the receptor doublet has an average pI of 7, both display charge heterogeneity and appear to have unique charge isomers. The relationship between the two components of the A431 EGF receptor is discussed.",,
19124746,Ig-like transcript 4 inhibits lipid antigen presentation through direct CD1d interaction.,"NKT cells recognize lipid Ags presented by CD1d molecules and play an important role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. In this study, we report the identification of a membrane-associated protein, Ig-like transcript 4 (ILT4), as a novel human CD1d receptor that inhibits CD1d-mediated immune responses. We found that native CD1d tetramer generated by mammalian cells was able to specifically bind human monocytes in the peripheral blood, and this binding was at least partly mediated by monocyte-expressed ILT4. The interaction between ILT4 and CD1d involves the two N-terminal domains of ILT4 and the Ag-binding groove of CD1d (alpha1/alpha2 domain). This interaction has been identified on the cell surface as well as in the endosomal and lysosomal compartments. Functional analysis showed that ILT4 could block the loading of lipid Ags such as alpha-GalCer, and consequently inhibited NKT recognition. The interaction between ILT4 and CD1d may provide new insights into the regulation of NKT-mediated immunity.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2009
22479204,Igf1r signaling is indispensable for preimplantation development and is activated via a novel function of E-cadherin.,"Insulin-like growth factor I receptor (Igf1r) signaling controls proliferation, differentiation, growth, and cell survival in many tissues; and its deregulated activity is involved in tumorigenesis. Although important during fetal growth and postnatal life, a function for the Igf pathway during preimplantation development has not been described. We show that abrogating Igf1r signaling with specific inhibitors blocks trophectoderm formation and compromises embryo survival during murine blastocyst formation. In normal embryos total Igf1r is present throughout the membrane, whereas the activated form is found exclusively at cell contact sites, colocalizing with E-cadherin. Using genetic domain switching, we show a requirement for E-cadherin to maintain proper activation of Igf1r. Embryos expressing exclusively a cadherin chimera with N-cadherin extracellular and E-cadherin intracellular domains (NcEc) fail to form a trophectoderm and cells die by apoptosis. In contrast, homozygous mutant embryos expressing a reverse-structured chimera (EcNc) show trophectoderm survival and blastocoel cavitation, indicating a crucial and non-substitutable role of the E-cadherin ectodomain for these processes. Strikingly, blastocyst formation can be rescued in homozygous NcEc embryos by restoring Igf1r signaling, which enhances cell survival. Hence, perturbation of E-cadherin extracellular integrity, independent of its cell-adhesion function, blocked Igf1r signaling and induced cell death in the trophectoderm. Our results reveal an important and yet undiscovered function of Igf1r during preimplantation development mediated by a unique physical interaction between Igf1r and E-cadherin indispensable for proper receptor activation and anti-apoptotic signaling. We provide novel insights into how ligand-dependent Igf1r activity is additionally gated to sense developmental potential in utero and into a bifunctional role of adhesion molecules in contact formation and signaling.",PLoS genetics,2012
18528331,IGFBP-4 is an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signalling required for cardiogenesis.,"Insulin-like growth-factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) bind to and modulate the actions of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). Although some of the actions of IGFBPs have been reported to be independent of IGFs, the precise mechanisms of IGF-independent actions of IGFBPs are largely unknown. Here we report a previously unknown function for IGFBP-4 as a cardiogenic growth factor. IGFBP-4 enhanced cardiomyocyte differentiation in vitro, and knockdown of Igfbp4 attenuated cardiomyogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. The cardiogenic effect of IGFBP-4 was independent of its IGF-binding activity but was mediated by the inhibitory effect on canonical Wnt signalling. IGFBP-4 physically interacted with a Wnt receptor, Frizzled 8 (Frz8), and a Wnt co-receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), and inhibited the binding of Wnt3A to Frz8 and LRP6. Although IGF-independent, the cardiogenic effect of IGFBP-4 was attenuated by IGFs through IGFBP-4 sequestration. IGFBP-4 is therefore an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signalling required for cardiogenesis and provides a molecular link between IGF signalling and Wnt signalling.",,
9820540,IL-1 receptor accessory protein is an essential component of the IL-1 receptor.,"The recently described IL-1R accessory protein (IL-1R AcP) interacts with IL-1beta and the IL-1 type-IR (IL-1RI), but an essential requirement for IL-1R AcP in IL-1 signaling in vitro has not been established and its role in vivo has not been examined. In this study, IL-1R AcP-deficient mice and fibroblasts were produced and characterized. All IL-1 agonists bound to IL-1R AcP-deficient cells through the type I IL-1R, but failed to activate gene expression through either the nuclear factor-kappaB or AP-1-dependent signaling pathways. Absence of IL-1R AcP differentially affected the affinity for IL-1 ligands. IL-1R AcP-deficient fibroblasts bound murine IL-1alpha and human IL-1R antagonist protein (IL-1Ra) with only moderately reduced affinity when compared with wild-type cells, whereas murine IL-1beta affinity was reduced by 70-fold. IL-1 also failed to produce a biologic response in vivo in IL-1R AcP-deficient mice. These data demonstrate that a type I IL-1R/IL-1R AcP complex is required for signaling by all IL-1 agonists and for high affinity binding by IL-1beta. Finally, IL-1R AcP is an essential signal transducing component of the functional IL-1R and should represent a novel target for blocking IL-1 function in human disease.",,
11086056,IL-12 receptor beta 2 (IL-12R beta 2)-deficient mice are defective in IL-12-mediated signaling despite the presence of high affinity IL-12 binding sites.,"Two subunits of the IL-12 receptor (IL-12R), IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R beta 2, have been identified and cloned. Previous studies demonstrated that the IL-12R beta 1 subunit was required for mouse T and NK cells to respond to IL-12 in vivo. To investigate the role of IL-12R beta 2 in IL-12 signaling, we have generated IL-12R beta 2-deficient (IL-12R beta 2(-/-)) mice by targeted mutation in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Although Con A-activated splenocytes from IL-12R beta 2(-/-) mice still bind IL-12 with both high and low affinity, no IL-12-induced biological functions can be detected. Con A-activated splenocytes of IL-12R beta 2(-/-) mice failed to produce IFN-gamma or proliferate in response to IL-12 stimulation. NK lytic activity of IL-12R beta 2(-/-) splenocytes was not induced when incubated with IL-12. IL-12R beta 2(-/-) splenocytes were deficient in IFN-gamma secretion when stimulated with either Con A or anti-CD3 mAb in vitro. Furthermore, IL-12R beta 2(-/-) mice were deficient in vivo in their ability to produce IFN-gamma following endotoxin administration and to generate a type 1 cytokine response. IL-12-mediated signal transduction was also defective as measured by phosphorylation of STAT4. These results demonstrate that although mouse IL-12R beta 1 is the subunit primarily responsible for binding IL-12, IL-12R beta 2 plays an essential role in mediating the biological functions of IL-12 in mice.",,
12704343,IL-13 receptors and signaling pathways: an evolving web.,"IL-13 is an immunoregulatory cytokine secreted predominantly by activated T(H)2 cells. Over the past several years, it has become evident that IL-13 is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. IL-13 shares many functional properties with IL-4, stemming from the fact that they share a common receptor subunit, the alpha subunit of the IL-4 receptor (IL-4Ralpha). Characterization of IL-13-deficient mice, IL-4-deficient mice, and IL-4 receptor alpha-deficient (IL-4Ralpha(-/-)) mice have demonstrated nonredundant roles for IL-13. IL-13 mediates its effects by interacting with a complex receptor system comprised of IL-4Ralpha and two IL-13 binding proteins, IL-13Ralpha1 and IL-13Ralpha2. IL-13 receptors are expressed on human B cells, basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, respiratory epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. However, functional IL-13 receptors have not been demonstrated on human or mouse T cells. Thus unlike IL-4, IL-13 does not appear to be important in the initial differentiation of CD4 T cells into T(H)2-type cells but rather appears to be important in the effector phase of allergic inflammation. This is further supported by many in vivo observations, including that administration of IL-13 resulted in allergic inflammation, tissue-specific overexpression of IL-13 in the lungs of transgenic mice resulted in airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion, IL-13 blockade abolished allergic inflammation independently of IL-4, and IL-13 appears to be more important than IL-4 in mucus hypersecretion. Given the importance of IL-13 as an effector molecule, regulation at the level of its receptors might be an important mechanism of modulating IL-13 responses and thus propagation of the allergic response. Accordingly, IL-13 is an attractive, novel therapeutic target for pharmacologic intervention in allergic disorders. This review will summarize the current understanding of the IL-13 receptors and signaling pathways, emphasizing recent observations.",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2003
21993848,IL-17C regulates the innate immune function of epithelial cells in an autocrine manner.,"Interleukin 17C (IL-17C) is a member of the IL-17 family that is selectively induced in epithelia by bacterial challenge and inflammatory stimuli. Here we show that IL-17C functioned in a unique autocrine manner, binding to a receptor complex consisting of the receptors IL-17RA and IL-17RE, which was preferentially expressed on tissue epithelial cells. IL-17C stimulated epithelial inflammatory responses, including the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides, which were similar to those induced by IL-17A and IL-17F. However, IL-17C was produced by distinct cellular sources, such as epithelial cells, in contrast to IL-17A, which was produced mainly by leukocytes, especially those of the T(H)17 subset of helper T cells. Whereas IL-17C promoted inflammation in an imiquimod-induced skin-inflammation model, it exerted protective functions in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Thus, IL-17C is an essential autocrine cytokine that regulates innate epithelial immune responses.",,

IL-17E is a ligand for the recently identified protein termed EVI27/IL-17BR, which we term IL-17 receptor homolog 1 (IL-17Rh1) in light of the multiple reported ligand-receptor relationships. Murine EVI27 was identified through its location at a common site of retroviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid leukemias. IL-17Rh1 shows highest level expression in kidney with moderate expression in multiple other organs, whereas IL-17E mRNA was detected at very low levels in several peripheral tissues. IL-17E induces activation of NF-kappaB and stimulates production of the proinflammatory chemokine IL-8.",,

IL-12 triggers Th1 polarization of naive CD4(+) T cells and secretion of IFN-gamma. We describe a new heterodimeric cytokine termed IL-27 that consists of EBI3, an IL-12p40-related protein, and p28, a newly discovered IL-12p35-related polypeptide. IL-27 is an early product of activated antigen-presenting cells and drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4(+) T cells. It also strongly synergizes with IL-12 to trigger IFN-gamma production of naive CD4(+) T cells. IL-27 mediates its biologic effects through the orphan cytokine receptor WSX-1/TCCR.",,

Here, we have identified from the human genomic sequence a family of three cytokines, designated interleukin 28A (IL-28A), IL-28B and IL-29, that are distantly related to type I interferons (IFNs) and the IL-10 family. We found that like type I IFNs, IL-28 and IL-29 were induced by viral infection and showed antiviral activity. However, IL-28 and IL-29 interacted with a heterodimeric class II cytokine receptor that consisted of IL-10 receptor beta (IL-10Rbeta) and an orphan class II receptor chain, designated IL-28Ralpha. This newly described cytokine family may serve as an alternative to type I IFNs in providing immunity to viral infection.",Nature immunology,2003
11035066,"IL-2R beta agonist P1-30 acts in synergy with IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, and IL-15: biological and molecular effects.","From the sequence of human IL-2 we have recently characterized a peptide (p1-30), which is the first IL-2 mimetic described. P1-30 covers the entire alpha helix A of IL-2 and spontaneously folds into a alpha helical homotetramer mimicking the quaternary structure of a hemopoietin. This neocytokine interacts with a previously undescribed dimeric form of the human IL-2 receptor beta-chain likely to form the p1-30 receptor (p1-30R). P1-30 acts as a specific IL-2Rbeta agonist, selectively inducing activation of CD8 and NK lymphocytes. From human PBMC we have also shown that p1-30 induces the activation of lymphokine-activated killer cells and the production of IFN-gamma. Here we demonstrate the ability of p1-30 to act in synergy with IL-2, -4, -9, and -15. These synergistic effects were analyzed at the functional level by using TS1beta, a murine T cell line endogenously expressing the common cytokine gamma gene and transfected with the human IL-2Rbeta gene. At the receptor level, we show that expression of human IL-2Rbeta is absolutely required to obtain synergistic effects, whereas IL-2Ralpha specifically impedes the synergistic effects obtained with IL-2. The results suggest that overexpression of IL-2Ralpha inhibits p1-30R formation in the presence of IL-2. Finally, concerning the molecular effects, although p1-30 alone induces the antiapoptotic molecule bcl-2, we show that it does not influence mRNA expression of c-myc, c-jun, and c-fos oncogenes. In contrast, p1-30 enhances IL-2-driven expression of these oncogenes. Our data suggest that p1-30R (IL-2Rbeta)(2) and intermediate affinity IL-2R (IL-2Rbetagamma), when simultaneously expressed at the cell surface, may induce complementary signal transduction pathways and act in synergy.",,
20926795,IL-33 mediates inflammatory responses in human lung tissue cells.,"IL-33 is a member of the IL-1 family and mediates its biological effects via the ST2 receptor, which is selectively expressed on Th2 cells and mast cells. Although polymorphic variation in ST2 is strongly associated with asthma, it is currently unclear whether IL-33 acts directly on lung tissue cells at sites of airway remodeling. Therefore, we aimed to identify the IL-33-responsive cells among primary human lung tissue cells. ST2 mRNA was expressed in both endothelial and epithelial cells but not in fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells. Correspondingly, IL-33 promoted IL-8 production by both endothelial and epithelial cells but not by fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells. Transfection of ST2 small interference RNA into both endothelial and epithelial cells significantly reduced the IL-33-dependent upregulation of IL-8, suggesting that IL-33-mediated responses in these cells occur via the ST2 receptor. Importantly, Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, further enhanced ST2 expression and function in both endothelial and epithelial cells. The IL-33-mediated production of IL-8 by epithelial cells was almost completely suppressed by corticosteroid treatment. In contrast, the effect of corticosteroid treatment on the IL-33-mediated responses of endothelial cells was only partial. IL-33 induced activation of both ERK and p38 MAPK in endothelial cells but only ERK in epithelial cells. p38 MAPK was required for the IL-33-mediated responses of endothelial cells, whereas ERK was required for IL-33-mediated IL-8 production by epithelial cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that IL-33-mediated inflammatory responses of lung tissue cells may be involved in the chronic allergic inflammation of the asthmatic airway.",,

Insight into their biological functions has led to novel therapeutic approaches to treat human inflammatory diseases. Within the IL-1 family, IL-1 alpha/beta, IL-1Ra, and IL-18 have been matched to their respective receptor complexes and have been shown to have distinct biological functions. The most prominent orphan IL-1 receptor is ST 2. This receptor has been described as a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor-IL-1 receptor signaling, but it also functions as an important effector molecule of T helper type 2 responses. We report a member of the IL-1 family, IL-33, which mediates its biological effects via IL-1 receptor ST 2, activates NF-kappaB and MAP kinases, and drives production of T(H)2-associated cytokines from in vitro polarized T(H)2 cells.

22729249,IL-34 is a tissue-restricted ligand of CSF1R required for the development of Langerhans cells and microglia.,"The differentiation of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells into monocytes, tissue macrophages and some dendritic cell (DC) subtypes requires the growth factor CSF1 and its receptor, CSF1R. Langerhans cells (LCs) and microglia develop from embryonic myeloid precursor cells that populate the epidermis and central nervous system (CNS) before birth. Notably, LCs and microglia are present in CSF1-deficient mice but absent from CSF1R-deficient mice. Here we investigated whether an alternative CSF1R ligand, interleukin 34 (IL-34), is responsible for this discrepancy. Through the use of IL-34-deficient (Il34(LacZ/LacZ)) reporter mice, we found that keratinocytes and neurons were the main sources of IL-34. Il34(LacZ/LacZ) mice selectively lacked LCs and microglia and responded poorly to skin antigens and viral infection of the CNS. Thus, IL-34 specifically directs the differentiation of myeloid cells in the skin epidermis and CNS.",Nature immunology,2012
25729923,IL-37 requires the receptors IL-18Rα and IL-1R8 (SIGIRR) to carry out its multifaceted anti-inflammatory program upon innate signal transduction.,"Interleukin 37 (IL-37) and IL-1R8 (SIGIRR or TIR8) are anti-inflammatory orphan members of the IL-1 ligand family and IL-1 receptor family, respectively. Here we demonstrate formation and function of the endogenous ligand-receptor complex IL-37-IL-1R8-IL-18Rα. The tripartite complex assembled rapidly on the surface of peripheral blood mononuclear cells upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Silencing of IL-1R8 or IL-18Rα impaired the anti-inflammatory activity of IL-37. Whereas mice with transgenic expression of IL-37 (IL-37tg mice) with intact IL-1R8 were protected from endotoxemia, IL-1R8-deficient IL-37tg mice were not. Proteomic and transcriptomic investigations revealed that IL-37 used IL-1R8 to harness the anti-inflammatory properties of the signaling molecules Mer, PTEN, STAT3 and p62(dok) and to inhibit the kinases Fyn and TAK1 and the transcription factor NF-κB, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, IL-37-IL-1R8 exerted a pseudo-starvational effect on the metabolic checkpoint kinase mTOR. IL-37 thus bound to IL-18Rα and exploited IL-1R8 to activate a multifaceted intracellular anti-inflammatory program.",,

11588013,Il-9 stimulates release of chemotactic factors from human bronchial epithelial cells.,"Interleukin (IL)-9 is a T helper 2 cytokine implicated as a candidate gene and contributor to human asthma. We hypothesized that the inflammatory potential of bronchial epithelium is affected by its local environment and explored this hypothesis with respect to the effect of IL-9 on bronchial epithelium. We investigated the response of primary and immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells to IL-9 stimulation with respect to the release of T-cell chemoattractant factors. In response to IL-9, the HBE4-E6/E7 cell line, but not BEAS-2B cells, released the T-cell chemoattractants IL-16 and regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) in a dose-dependent fashion. We found a similar dose response to IL-9 in primary cells from bronchial brushings of healthy subjects and that nearly all of the T-cell chemoattraction was attributable to IL-16 and RANTES. Reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction of BEAS-2B, HBE4-E6/E7, and primary cells from two subjects revealed messenger RNA for IL-9 receptor (IL-9R) alpha but not in BEAS-2B cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of HBE4-E6/E7 and primary cells confirmed surface expression of the IL-9 receptor. Costimulation of both cell types with IL-9 and antibody to either gamma-common chain or IL-9Ralpha completely blocked the release of T-cell chemoattractant activity, confirming the primary role of a functioning IL-9 receptor for IL-9 signaling in HBE4-E6/E7 and primary bronchial epithelial cells. We conclude that IL-9 is a stimulus for airway epithelial cell release of T-cell chemoattractant factors, which in turn may modulate the immune response in allergic airway inflammation.",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2001

Here we report that CD27, which is expressed on stem and early progenitor cells in bone marrow, can be important in this process. Deletion of CD27 increased the myeloid colony-forming potential of stem and early progenitor cells and enhanced B lymphoid reconstitutive capacity in competitive transplantation experiments. Conversely, stimulation of CD27(+) progenitor cells with CD70, the unique ligand for CD27, inhibited colony-forming potential in vitro and lymphocyte outgrowth in vivo. As CD70 is expressed only on activated immune cells, we suggest that CD27 triggering on early progenitor cells provides a negative feedback signal to leukocyte differentiation during immune activation.",Nature immunology,2005

Following standard cytochemical processing with the appropriate controls, adult worms of both murine and primate origin were found to have mouse alpha2M-like determinants on their surfaces.

BTC mRNA is known to be expressed in several human organs. However, the localization of BTC in human vascular tissues has not yet been clarified. We investigated whether or not BTC protein is involved in the pathogenesis of human atherosclerosis. Recombinant human BTC showed a mitogenic activity on cultured human aortic SMCs by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. The immunohistochemical localization of BTC, SMCs, macrophages, EGF receptors and ErbB4 was examined in autopsied human aortas. BTC was detected in both intimal and medial SMCs of the aortic wall. The percentage of BTC-positive medial SMCs in early types of atherosclerotic lesions decreased with age, but in adult, it was significantly higher in advanced types than in early types of atherosclerotic lesions. BTC-positive SMCs were predominantly localized in the medial side of the intima. Furthermore, numerous BTC-positive SMCs and macrophages were observed around the core lesion of atherosclerotic plaques. Receptors for BTC, EGF receptor and ErbB4, were expressed on SMCs, suggesting that BTC is associated with EGF receptor family-mediated signaling. BTC is produced in human aortic tissue and might play important roles in atherogenesis.",,

Four nectins have been identified. Five nectin-like molecules, which have domain structures similar to those of nectins, have been identified, and we characterized here nectin-like molecule-2 (Necl-2)/IGSF4/RA175/SgIGSF/TSLC1/SynCAM1. Necl-2 showed Ca2+-independent homophilic cell-cell adhesion activity. It furthermore showed Ca2+-independent heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activity with Necl-1/TSLL1/SynCAM3 and nectin-3. Necl-2 was widely expressed in rat tissues examined. Necl-2 localized at the basolateral plasma membrane in epithelial cells of the mouse gall bladder, but not at specialized cell-cell junctions, such as tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes. Nectins bind afadin, whereas Necl-2 did not bind afadin but bound Pals2, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase family member known to bind Lin-7, implicated in the proper localization of the Let-23 protein in Caenorhabditis elegans, the homologue of mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor.

10749879,Importance of the major extracellular domain of CD9 and the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor for up-regulation of binding and activity.,"Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of the EGF family of growth factors. The membrane-anchored form of HB-EGF (proHB-EGF) is mitogenically active to neighboring cells as well as being a precursor of the soluble form. In addition to its mitogenic activity, proHB-EGF has the property of binding to diphtheria toxin (DT), serving as the specific receptor for DT. Tetramembrane-spanning protein CD9, a member of the TM4 superfamily, is physically associated with proHB-EGF at the cell surface and up-regulates both mitogenic and DT binding activities of proHB-EGF. To understand this up-regulation mechanism, we studied essential regions of both CD9 and proHB-EGF for up-regulation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that not only CD9 but also other TM4 proteins including CD63, CD81, and CD82 associate with proHB-EGF on the cell surface. However, these TM4 proteins did not up-regulate DT binding activity of proHB-EGF. Transfection of a series of chimeric constructs comprising CD9 and CD81 showed that the major extracellular domain of CD9 is essential for up-regulation. Assays of DT binding activity and juxtacrine mitogenic activity of the deletion mutants of proHB-EGF and chimeric molecules, derived from proHB-EGF and TGF-alpha, showed that the essential domain of proHB-EGF for up-regulation is the EGF-like domain. These results indicate that the interaction of the extracellular domains of both molecules is important for up-regulation.",,

Affected children invariably die of mycobacterial infection, unless bone marrow transplantation is undertaken. Pathogenic IFNGR1 mutations identified to date include nonsense and splice mutations and frameshift deletions and insertions. All result in a premature stop codon upstream from the segment encoding the transmembrane domain, precluding cell surface expression of the receptors. We report herein two sporadic and two familial cases of a novel form of complete IFNgammaR1 deficiency in which normal numbers of receptors are detected at the cell surface. Two in-frame deletions and two missense IFNGR1 mutations were identified in the segment encoding the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the receptor. Eight independent IFNgammaR1-specific mAb's, including seven blocking antibodies, gave recognition patterns that differed between patients, suggesting that different epitopes were altered by the mutations. No specific binding of (125)I-IFN-gamma to cells was observed in any patient, however, and the cells failed to respond to IFN-gamma. The mutations therefore cause complete IFNgammaR1 deficiency by disrupting the IFN-gamma-binding site without affecting surface expression. The detection of surface IFNgammaR1 molecules by specific antibodies, including blocking antibodies, does not exclude a diagnosis of complete IFNgammaR1 deficiency.",,

Our recent work has focused on new methods to radiolabel the CCK8 peptide with 111In or 99mTc for CCK-B receptor imaging. Derivatives of CCK8 were obtained by addition at the N-terminus in solid phase of a DTPA derivative (DTPAGlu) linked through a glycine spacer (DTPAGlu-G-CCK8) or cysteine, glycine and a diphenylphosphinopropionyl moiety (PhosGC-CCK8) for labeling with 111In and 99mTc, respectively. CCK-BR overexpressing A431 cancer cell lines were utilized to characterize in vitro properties of the two compounds as well as for generating xenografts in nude mice for in vivo characterization. Both 111In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8 and 99mTcPhosGC-CCK8 showed similar binding affinities for CCK-BR with dissociation constants of 20-40 nM, were internalized after interaction with the receptor and displayed prolonged cellular retention times. Specific in vivo interaction with the receptor of both CCK8 analogs was observed in our animal model. 111In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8 showed better target to non-target ratios, although it appeared to be rapidly metabolized after injection and activity cleared through the kidneys. 99mTc-PhosGC-CCK8 was more stable in vivo but showed marked hepatobiliary clearance with resulting high background activity in the bowel.

11498506,Inactivation of platelet-derived growth factor-BB following modification by ADP-ribosyltransferase.,"1. Arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART1) is expressed on the surface of a number of cell types, and catalyses the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD(+) to target proteins. We investigated whether extracellular proteins such as growth factors may serve as substrates for this enzyme, with subsequent alteration in their biological activity. Experiments were performed with rat skeletal muscle membranes and V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts with doxycycline-inducible expression of human ART. 2. From a panel of growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) was found to be the best substrate for ART1, whereas the structural homologue PDGF-AA was not a substrate. Under conditions of maximum labelling 5 mol ADP-ribose was incorporated per mol of PDGF-BB. 3. Purified (ADP-ribosyl)-PDGF-BB did not stimulate a mitogenic or chemotactic response in human pulmonary smooth muscle cells, and showed a reduced capacity to bind to PDGF receptors in competition binding experiments, when compared to unmodified PDGF-BB. 4. PDGF-dependent [(3)H-methyl]-thymidine incorporation was measured in the ART1-transfected fibroblast cell line at physiological concentrations of PDGF-BB, and without addition of extracellular NAD(+). Fibroblasts expressing human ART1 at the cell surface showed reduced mitogenic responses to PDGF-BB, but not to PDGF-AA. This loss of mitogenic response in cells expressing ART1 activity was reversed by the addition of agmatine (an ART1 substrate). 5. In conclusion, we propose that PDGF-BB-dependent signalling may be regulated by post-translational modification of the growth factor by ART1 at the cell surface.

The first identified Wnt signaling pathway, the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, has been studied in much detail and is highly conserved among species. As to non-canonical Wnt pathways, the current situation is more nebulous partly because the intracellular mediators of this pathway are not yet fully understood and, in some cases, even identified. However, there are increasing data that prove the existence of non-canonical Wnt signaling and demonstrate its involvement in different developmental processes. In vertebrates, Wnt-11 and Wnt-5A can activate the Wnt/JNK pathway, which resembles the planar cell polarity pathway in Drosophila. The Wnt/Ca(2+)-pathway has only been described in Xenopus and zebrafish so far and it is unclear whether it also exists in other organisms. Two recent papers provide us with new insight into non-canonical Wnt signaling by (1) presenting a new intracellular mediator of non-canonical signaling in Xenopus1 and (2) implicating the existence of an additional non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway in flies.","BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",2002

15766588,Infrequent mutation of TRAIL receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2/DR5) in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with 8p21 loss of heterozygosity.,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 8p is a frequent event in many cancers and is often associated with more aggressive disease. Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) also known as TNFRSF10B (tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) super family 10b) or KILLER/DR5, a member of the TNFR family, is a promising candidate tumour suppressor gene at 8p21-22. Mutations in this gene have been identified in non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We carried out mutation analysis of TRAIL-R2 in bladder cancer cell lines and in primary bladder tumours. One novel protein truncating mutation was identified in a bladder cancer cell line. Our results suggest that if TRAIL-R2 is the target of LOH events in these cancers, inactivation of the remaining allele is by a mechanism other than mutation.",Cancer letters,2005
9202237,Inhibin interferes with activin signaling at the level of the activin receptor complex in Chinese hamster ovary cells.,"To gain more insight in the mechanism of action of inhibin, we studied the effect of inhibin on activin signaling in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Inhibin specifically counteracted activin-induced expression of a plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 promoter element (3TP) and of the junB gene, but was ineffective when the responses were induced by transforming growth factor-beta. This indicates that inhibin acts only on the activin-specific part of these signaling cascades. Using a constitutively active activin type IB receptor we determined whether inhibin acted at the level of the activin-receptor complex or downstream of it. The mutant activin receptor stimulated the expression of the 3TP promoter in the absence of activin. This stimulation was insensitive to inhibin, indicating that inhibin acts exclusively at or upstream of this activin type I receptor. In addition, competition studies using labeled activin showed that inhibin displaced activin from the activin type II receptors, especially from the activin type IIB receptor, but not from the type I receptors. In conclusion, these data show that in Chinese hamster ovary cells inhibin acts directly at the activin receptor complex, most likely through displacement of activin from the activin type II receptor.",Endocrinology,1997
12493742,Inhibin is an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein signaling.,"Inhibins are endogenous antagonists of activin signaling, long recognized as important regulators of gonadal function and pituitary FSH release. Inhibin, in concert with its co-receptor, betaglycan, can compete with activin for binding to type II activin receptors and, thus, prevent activin signaling. Because bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) also utilize type II activin receptors, we hypothesized that BMP signaling might also be sensitive to inhibin blockade. Here we show that inhibin blocks cellular responses to diverse BMP family members in a variety of BMP-responsive cell types. Inhibin abrogates BMP-induced Smad signaling and transcription responses. Inhibin competes with BMPs for type II activin receptors, and this competition is facilitated by betaglycan. Betaglycan also enables inhibin to bind to and compete with BMPs for binding to the BMP-specific type II receptor BMPRII, which does not bind inhibin in the absence of betaglycan. Betaglycan can confer inhibin responsiveness on cells that are otherwise insensitive to inhibin. These findings demonstrate that inhibin, acting through betaglycan, can function as an antagonist of BMP responses, suggesting a broader role for inhibin and betaglycan in restricting and refining a wide spectrum of transforming growth factor beta superfamily signals.",,
12651901,"Inhibin, activin, follistatin, activin receptors and beta-glycan gene expression in the placental tissue of patients with pre-eclampsia.","The objective of this study was to quantify the relative expression of inhibin alpha, inhibin/activin beta(A), beta(B), beta(C), follistatin, activin receptors and beta-glycan genes in placental tissue of term pre-eclamptic patients and controls to investigate if these genes are up-regulated in the placenta in pre-eclampsia. Seven women with pre-eclampsia symptoms were matched with 10 normal pregnant controls for gestational age, maternal age, and parity. Total RNA was isolated from each sample. Complementary DNA samples produced by reverse transcription were used in the real time PCR to quantify the expression of inhibin alpha subunit, inhibin/activin beta(A), beta(B), beta(C) subunits, follistatin, ACTRIA, ACTRIB, ACTRIIA, ACTRIIB, beta-glycan and GAPDH genes. The ratio between the target and GAPDH expression was calculated to provide relative gene expression. Inhibin alpha:GAPDH and inhibin/activin beta(A): GAPDH ratios were significantly higher in placental tissue from women with pre-eclampsia (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01 respectively) compared with matched control placental gene expression. Placental samples from both groups expressed beta(B), beta(C), follistatin, activin receptors and beta-glycan genes. However, there was no significant difference in the relative expression of these genes between the groups. Increases in the placental expression of inhibin alpha and inhibin/activin beta(A) subunit genes could contribute to the rise in circulating levels of inhibin A and activin A in pre-eclampsia. The mechanism(s) involved in increased gene expression in pre-eclampsia is as yet unclear.",,

20484822,Inhibition of pulmonary fibrosis in mice by CXCL10 requires glycosaminoglycan binding and syndecan-4.,"Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, dysregulated response to injury culminating in compromised lung function due to excess extracellular matrix production. The heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-4 is important in mediating fibroblast-matrix interactions, but its role in pulmonary fibrosis has not been explored. To investigate this issue, we used intratracheal instillation of bleomycin as a model of acute lung injury and fibrosis. We found that bleomycin treatment increased syndecan-4 expression. Moreover, we observed a marked decrease in neutrophil recruitment and an increase in both myofibroblast recruitment and interstitial fibrosis in bleomycin-treated syndecan-4-null (Sdc4-/-) mice. Subsequently, we identified a direct interaction between CXCL10, an antifibrotic chemokine, and syndecan-4 that inhibited primary lung fibroblast migration during fibrosis; mutation of the heparin-binding domain, but not the CXCR3 domain, of CXCL10 diminished this effect. Similarly, migration of fibroblasts from patients with pulmonary fibrosis was inhibited in the presence of CXCL10 protein defective in CXCR3 binding. Furthermore, administration of recombinant CXCL10 protein inhibited fibrosis in WT mice, but not in Sdc4-/- mice. Collectively, these data suggest that the direct interaction of syndecan-4 and CXCL10 in the lung interstitial compartment serves to inhibit fibroblast recruitment and subsequent fibrosis. Thus, administration of CXCL10 protein defective in CXCR3 binding may represent a novel therapy for pulmonary fibrosis.",,
20724449,Inhibition of Wnt signaling by Wise (Sostdc1) and negative feedback from Shh controls tooth number and patterning.,"Mice carrying mutations in Wise (Sostdc1) display defects in many aspects of tooth development, including tooth number, size and cusp pattern. To understand the basis of these defects, we have investigated the pathways modulated by Wise in tooth development. We present evidence that, in tooth development, Wise suppresses survival of the diastema or incisor vestigial buds by serving as an inhibitor of Lrp5- and Lrp6-dependent Wnt signaling. Reducing the dosage of the Wnt co-receptor genes Lrp5 and Lrp6 rescues the Wise-null tooth phenotypes. Inactivation of Wise leads to elevated Wnt signaling and, as a consequence, vestigial tooth buds in the normally toothless diastema region display increased proliferation and continuous development to form supernumerary teeth. Conversely, gain-of-function studies show that ectopic Wise reduces Wnt signaling and tooth number. Our analyses demonstrate that the Fgf and Shh pathways are major downstream targets of Wise-regulated Wnt signaling. Furthermore, our experiments revealed that Shh acts as a negative-feedback regulator of Wnt signaling and thus determines the fate of the vestigial buds and later tooth patterning. These data provide insight into the mechanisms that control Wnt signaling in tooth development and into how crosstalk among signaling pathways controls tooth number and morphogenesis.",,
22303445,Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by a soluble collagen-derived frizzled domain interacting with Wnt3a and the receptors frizzled 1 and 8.,"The Wnt/β-catenin pathway controls cell proliferation, death and differentiation. Several families of extracellular proteins can antagonize Wnt/β-catenin signaling, including the decoy receptors known as secreted frizzled related proteins (SFRPs), which have a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) structurally similar to the extracellular Wnt-binding domain of the frizzled receptors. SFRPs inhibit Wnt signaling by sequestering Wnts through the CRD or by forming inactive complexes with the frizzled receptors. Other endogenous molecules carrying frizzled CRDs inhibit Wnt signaling, such as V3Nter, which is proteolytically derived from the cell surface component collagen XVIII and contains a biologically active frizzled domain (FZC18) inhibiting in vivo cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice. We recently showed that FZC18 expressing cells deliver short-range signals to neighboring cells, decreasing their proliferation in vitro and in vivo through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Here, using low concentrations of soluble FZC18 and Wnt3a, we show that they physically interact in a cell-free system. In addition, soluble FZC18 binds the frizzled 1 and 8 receptors' CRDs, reducing cell sensitivity to Wnt3a. Conversely, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling was partially rescued by the expression of full-length frizzled 1 and 8 receptors, but enhanced by the expression of a chimeric cell-membrane-tethered frizzled 8 CRD. Moreover, soluble, partially purified recombinant FZC18_CRD inhibited Wnt3a-induced β-catenin activation. Taken together, the data indicate that collagen XVIII-derived frizzled CRD shifts Wnt sensitivity of normal cells to a lower pitch and controls their growth.",PloS one,2012
7615497,Inhibitory effect on the lipolysis-stimulated receptor of the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein.,"Adenovirus vector-mediated transfer of the receptor-associated protein (RAP) gene into low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient mice was shown to achieve plasma concentrations ranging between 20 and 200 micrograms/ml and to result in the accumulation of remnant lipoproteins (Willnow, T. E., Sheng, Z., Ishibashi, S., and Herz, J. (1994) Science 264, 1471-1474). Both this finding and the observation that in addition to various other members of the LDL receptor gene family, RAP binds to a yet unidentified protein of apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa prompted us to examine the effect of high concentrations of RAP on the lipolysis-stimulated receptor (LSR). LSR is a receptor distinct from the LDL receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein and is capable of binding apoB and apoE when activated by free fatty acids. Data reported here show that in fibroblasts isolated from a subject homozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia, RAP fusion protein inhibited LSR-mediated binding of 125I-LDL and the subsequent internalization and degradation of the particles. Studies on the interaction of RAP with LSR in isolated rat liver membranes revealed that at concentrations > or = 10 micrograms/ml, RAP inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the binding of LDL to LSR; half-maximum inhibition was obtained with 20 micrograms/ml RAP. Ligand blotting studies revealed that RAP bound directly to two rat liver membrane proteins of apparent molecular masses identical to those that bind 125I-LDL after preincubation with oleate. However, unlike LDL, binding of 125I-RAP to LSR did not require preincubation with oleate. Preincubation of nitrocellulose membranes with an excess of unlabeled RAP fusion protein decreased oleate-induced binding of 125I-LDL to LSR candidate proteins, whereas preincubation with excess unlabeled LDL was unable to prevent the subsequent binding of 125I-RAP to the LSR proteins. Both the latter data and analysis of the mechanism of inhibition were consistent with the RAP inhibitory effect on LSR being achieved by interference with a site distinct from the oleate-induced LDL binding site. In conclusion, this study shows that at concentrations reported to delay chylomicron remnant removal in LDL receptor-deficient mice, RAP exerted a significant inhibitory effect on LSR.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1995
8832397,"Initial characterization of anosmin-1, a putative extracellular matrix protein synthesized by definite neuronal cell populations in the central nervous system.","The KAL gene is responsible for the X-chromosome linked form of Kallmann's syndrome in humans. Upon transfection of CHO cells with a human KAL cDNA, the corresponding encoded protein, KALc, was produced. This protein is N-glycosylated, secreted in the cell culture medium, and is localized at the cell surface. Several lines of evidence indicate that heparan-sulfate chains of proteoglycan(s) are involved in the binding of KALc to the cell membrane. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the purified KALc were generated. They allowed us to detect and characterize the protein encoded by the KAL gene in the chicken central nervous system at late stages of embryonic development. This protein is synthesized by definite neuronal cell populations including Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, mitral cells in the olfactory bulbs and several subpopulations in the optic tectum and the striatum. The protein, with an approximate molecular mass of 100 kDa, was named anosmin-1 in reference to the deficiency of the sense of smell which characterizes the human disease. Anosmin-1 is likely to be an extracellular matrix component. Since heparin treatment of cell membrane fractions from cerebellum and tectum resulted in the release of the protein, we suggest that one or several heparan-sulfate proteoglycans are involved in the binding of anosmin-1 to the membranes in vivo.",,
14732692,Insights into the molecular basis for fibroblast growth factor receptor autoinhibition and ligand-binding promiscuity.,"The prototypical fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) extracellular domain consists of three Ig domains (D1-D3) of which the two membrane-proximal D2 and D3 domains and the interconnecting D2-D3 linker bear the determinants of ligand binding and specificity. In contrast, D1 and the D1-D2 linker are thought to play autoinhibitory roles in FGFR regulation. Here, we report the crystal structure of the three-Ig form of FGFR3c in complex with FGF1, an FGF that binds promiscuously to each of the seven principal FGFRs. In this structure, D1 and the D1-D2 linker are completely disordered, demonstrating that these regions are dispensable for FGF binding. Real-time binding experiments using surface plasmon resonance show that relative to two-Ig form, the three-Ig form of FGFR3c exhibits lower affinity for both FGF1 and heparin. Importantly, we demonstrate that this autoinhibition is mediated by intramolecular interactions of D1 and the D1-D2 linker with the minimal FGF and heparin-binding D2-D3 region. As in the FGF1-FGFR2c structure, but not the FGF1-FGFR1c structure, the alternatively spliced betaC'-betaE loop is ordered and interacts with FGF1 in the FGF1-FGFR3c structure. However, in contrast to the FGF1-FGFR2c structure in which the betaC'-betaE loop interacts with the beta-trefoil core region of FGF1, in the FGF1-FGFR3c structure, this loop interacts extensively with the N-terminal region of FGF1, underscoring the importance of the FGF1 N terminus in conferring receptor-binding affinity and promiscuity. Importantly, comparison of the three FGF1-FGFR structures shows that the flexibility of the betaC'-betaE loop is a major determinant of ligand-binding specificity and promiscuity.",,
12114498,INSL3/Leydig insulin-like peptide activates the LGR8 receptor important in testis descent.,"Several orphan G protein-coupled receptors homologous to gonadotropin and thyrotropin receptors have recently been identified and named as LGR4-8. INSL3, also known as Leydig insulin-like peptide or relaxin-like factor, is a relaxin family member expressed in testis Leydig cells and ovarian theca and luteal cells. Male mice mutant for INSL3 exhibit cryptorchidism or defects in testis descent due to abnormal gubernaculum development whereas overexpression of INSL3 induces ovary descent in transgenic females. Because transgenic mice missing the LGR8 gene are also cryptorchid, INSL3 was tested as the ligand for LGR8. Here, we show that treatment with INSL3 stimulated cAMP production in cells expressing recombinant LGR8 but not LGR7. In addition, interactions between INSL3 and LGR8 were demonstrated following ligand receptor cross-linking. Northern blot analysis indicated that the LGR8 transcripts are expressed in gubernaculum whereas treatment of cultured gubernacular cells with INSL3 stimulated cAMP production and thymidine incorporation. The present study identified the ligand for an orphan G protein-coupled receptor based on common phenotypes of ligand and receptor null mice. Demonstration of INSL3 as the ligand for LGR8 facilitates understanding of the mechanism of testis descent and allows studies on the role of INSL3 in gonadal and other physiological processes.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
15525639,INSL5 is a high affinity specific agonist for GPCR142 (GPR100).,"Insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5) is a peptide that belongs to the relaxin/insulin family, and its receptor has not been identified. In this report, we demonstrate that INSL5 is a specific agonist for GPCR142. Human INSL5 displaces the binding of (125)I-relaxin-3 to GPCR142 with a high affinity (K(i) = 1.5 nM). In a saturation binding assay, (125)I-INSL5 binds GPCR142 with a K(d) value of 2.5 nM. In functional guanosine (gamma-thio)-triphosphate binding and cAMP accumulation assays, INSL5 potently activates GPCR142 with EC(50) values of 1.3 and 1.2 nM, respectively. In addition, INSL5 stimulates Ca(2+) mobilization in HEK293 cells expressing GPCR142 and G alpha(16). Overall, INSL5 behaves as an agonist for GPCR142 similar to relaxin-3. However, unlike relaxin-3, which is also a potent agonist for GPCR135 and LGR7, INSL5 does not activate either GPCR135 or LGR7. INSL5 inhibits (125)I-relaxin-3 binding to GPCR135 with a low potency (K(i) = 500 nM). A functional assay shows that INSL5 (1 microm) is a weak antagonist for GPCR135. In addition, INSL5 (up to 1 microm) shows no affinity or activity at LGR7 or LGR8 either in a binding assay or a bio-functional assay. Previously, we have demonstrated that GPCR142 mRNA is expressed in peripheral tissues, particularly in the colon. Here we show that INSL5 mRNA is expressed in many peripheral tissues, similar to GPCR142. The high affinity interaction between INSL5 and GPCR142 coupled with their co-evolution and partially overlapping tissue expression patterns strongly suggest that INSL5 is an endogenous ligand for GPCR142.",,
2877871,Insulin-like growth factor I receptor primary structure: comparison with insulin receptor suggests structural determinants that define functional specificity.,"To identify structural characteristics of the closely related cell surface receptors for insulin and IGF-I that define their distinct physiological roles, we determined the complete primary structure of the human IGF-I receptor from cloned cDNA. The deduced sequence predicts a 1367 amino acid receptor precursor, including a 30-residue signal peptide, which is removed during translocation of the nascent polypeptide chain. The 1337 residue, unmodified proreceptor polypeptide has a predicted Mr of 151,869, which compares with the 180,000 Mr IGF-I receptor precursor. In analogy with the 152,784 Mr insulin receptor precursor, cleavage of the Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg sequence at position 707 of the IGF-I receptor precursor will generate alpha (80,423 Mr) and beta (70,866 Mr) subunits, which compare with approximately 135,000 Mr (alpha) and 90,000 Mr (beta) fully glycosylated subunits.",The EMBO journal,1986

The type 1 receptor mediates most of the biological effects of IGF-I and IGF-II; the type 2 receptor is involved with IGF-II degradation. Binding proteins may both localise IGFs to the receptors and regulate their activities. The IGF2 gene is maternally imprinted in mouse and human. Relaxation of IGF2 imprinting occurs in the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome of somatic overgrowth, sporadic Wilms' tumour and a number of other cancers. In the general adult population, the IGF2-INS gene cluster may also influence body weight, in which case IGF-II function could become a target for therapeutic intervention in obesity.",The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,1998

16195248,Insulin-like growth factor-I signaling in smooth muscle cells is regulated by ligand binding to the 177CYDMKTTC184 sequence of the beta3-subunit of alphaVbeta3.,"The response of smooth muscle cells to IGF-I requires ligand occupancy of the alphaVbeta3 integrin. We have shown that vitronectin (Vn) is required for IGF-I-stimulated migration or proliferation, whereas the anti-alphaVbeta3 monoclonal antibody, LM609, which inhibits ligand binding, blocks responsiveness of these cells to IGF-I. The amino acids 177-184 ((177)CYDMKTTC(184)) within the extracellular domain of beta3 have been proposed to confer the ligand specificity of alphaVbeta3; therefore, we hypothesized that ligand binding to the 177-184 cysteine loop of beta3 may be an important regulator of the cross talk between alphaVbeta3 and IGF-I in SMCs. Here we demonstrate that blocking ligand binding to a specific amino acid sequence within the beta3 subunit of alphaVbeta3 (i.e. amino acids 177-184) blocked Vn binding to the beta3 subunit of alphaVbeta3 and correspondingly beta3 phosphorylation was decreased. In the presence of this antibody, IGF-I-stimulated Shc phosphorylation and ERK 1/2 activation were impaired, and this was associated with an inhibition in the ability of IGF-I to stimulate an increase in migration or proliferation. Furthermore, in cells expressing a mutated form of beta3 in which three critical residues within the 177-184 sequence were altered beta3 phosphorylation was decreased. This was associated with a loss of IGF-I-stimulated Shc phosphorylation and impaired smooth muscle cell proliferation in response to IGF-I. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the 177-184 sequence of beta3 is necessary for Vn binding to alphaVbeta3 and that ligand occupancy of this site is necessary for an optimal response of smooth muscle cells to IGF-I.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",2006

To identify ligands, we have prepared a function-blocking antiserum to the extracellular domain of alpha 8, and we have established by transfection K562 cell lines that stably express alpha 8 beta 1 heterodimers on the cell surface. We demonstrate here by cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth assays that alpha 8 beta 1 is a fibronectin receptor. Studies on fibronectin fragments using RGD peptides as inhibitors show that alpha 8 beta 1 binds to the RGD site of fibronectin. In contrast to the endogenous alpha 5 beta 1 fibronectin receptor in K562 cells, alpha 8 beta 1 not only promotes cell attachment but also extensive cell spreading, suggesting functional differences between the two receptors. In chick embryo fibroblasts, alpha 8 beta 1 is localized to focal adhesions. We conclude that alpha 8 beta 1 is a receptor for fibronectin and can promote attachment, cell spreading, and neurite outgrowth on fibronectin.",Molecular biology of the cell,1995
11331280,Integrin alpha(v)beta(3)/vitronectin interaction affects expression of the urokinase system in human ovarian cancer cells.,"The urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), together with its receptor uPAR and the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) plays a pivotal role during tumor invasion and metastasis. Integrins, via interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM), control cell adhesion and motility. The two systems are functionally linked because uPAR and PAI-1 bind to the ECM component vitronectin (VN). Because integrin signaling alters gene expression patterns, we investigated whether the expression levels of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 are affected by ECM/integrin interactions. Expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 was significantly enhanced when human ovarian cancer cells (OV-MZ-6) were cultivated on fibronectin or collagen type IV. In contrast, VN induced down-regulation of uPA and uPAR while increasing PAI-1 by up to 4-fold. VN-dependent decrease of uPA protein was paralleled by a significant reduction of uPA promoter activity that was even more pronounced upon alpha(v)beta(3) overexpression and depended on the presence of intact Rel protein-binding sites. The activity of Rel transcription factors was also significantly reduced upon alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated cell adhesion to VN. The activity of the Rel-unresponsive PAI-1 promoter was up to 5-fold induced as a function of alpha(v)beta(3)/VN interaction. Thus, the balance between available concentrations of uPA, uPAR, PAI-1, and integrins in human ovarian cancer cells might provide a switch within the regulation of their invasive phenotype.",,

9281592,Integrin alpha2beta1 is a receptor for the cartilage matrix protein chondroadherin.,"Chondroadherin (the 36-kD protein) is a leucine-rich, cartilage matrix protein known to mediate adhesion of isolated chondrocytes. In the present study we investigated cell surface proteins involved in the interaction of cells with chondroadherin in cell adhesion and by affinity purification. Adhesion of bovine articular chondrocytes to chondroadherin-coated dishes was dependent on Mg2+ or Mn2+ but not Ca2+. Adhesion was partially inhibited by an antibody recognizing beta1 integrin subunit. Chondroadherin-binding proteins from chondrocyte lysates were affinity purified on chondroadherin-Sepharose. The beta1 integrin antibody immunoprecipitated two proteins with molecular mass approximately 110 and 140 kD (nonreduced) from the EDTA-eluted material. These results indicate that a beta1 integrin on chondrocytes interacts with chondroadherin. To identify the alpha integrin subunit(s) involved in interaction of cells with the protein, we affinity purified chondroadherin-binding membrane proteins from human fibroblasts. Immunoprecipitation of the EDTA-eluted material from the affinity column identified alpha2beta1 as a chondroadherin-binding integrin. These results are in agreement with cell adhesion experiments where antibodies against the integrin subunit alpha2 partially inhibited adhesion of human fibroblast and human chondrocytes to chondroadherin. Since alpha2beta1 also is a receptor for collagen type II, we tested the ability of different antibodies against the alpha2 subunit to inhibit adhesion of T47D cells to collagen type II and chondroadherin. The results suggested that adhesion to collagen type II and chondroadherin involves similar or nearby sites on the alpha2beta1 integrin. Although alpha2beta1 is a receptor for both collagen type II and chondroadherin, only adhesion of cells to collagen type II was found to mediate spreading.",The Journal of cell biology,1997
14970227,Integrin alpha5beta1 and ADAM-17 interact in vitro and co-localize in migrating HeLa cells.,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM-17) has diverse roles in the proteolytic processing of cell surface molecules and, due to its ability to process TNFalpha, is a validated therapeutic target for anti-inflammatory therapies. Unlike a number of other ADAM proteins, which interact with integrin receptors via their disintegrin domains, there is currently no evidence for an ADAM-17-integrin association. By analyzing the adhesion of a series of cell lines with recombinant fragments of the extracellular domain of ADAM-17, we now demonstrate a functional interaction between ADAM-17 and alpha(5)beta(1) integrin in a trans orientation. Because ADAM-17-mediated adhesion was sensitive to RGD peptides and EDTA, and the integrin-binding site within ADAM-17 was narrowed down to the disintegrin/cysteine-rich region, the two molecules appear to have a ligand-receptor relationship mediated by the alpha(5)beta(1) ligand binding pocket. Intriguingly, ADAM-17 and alpha(5)beta(1) were found to co-localize in both membrane ruffles and focal adhesions in HeLa cells. When confluent HeLa cell monolayers were wounded, ADAM-17 and alpha(5)beta(1) redistributed to the leading edge and co-localized, which is suggestive of a cis orientation. We postulate that the interaction of ADAM-17 with alpha(5)beta(1) may target or modulate its metalloproteolytic activity.",,
15355350,Integrin receptor specificity for human red cell ICAM-4 ligand. Critical residues for alphaIIbeta3 binding.,"The red cell intercellular adhesion molecule-4 (ICAM-4) binds to different members of the integrin receptor families. To better define the ICAM-4 integrin receptor specificity, cell transfectants individually expressing various integrins were used to demonstrate that alphaLbeta2, alphaMbeta2, and alphaIIbbeta3 (activated) bind specifically and dose dependently to the recombinant ICAM-4-Fc protein. We also show that cell surface ICAM-4 interacts with the cell surface alphaVbeta3 integrin. In addition, using a alpha4beta1 cell transfectant and beta2 integrin-deficient LAD cells, we show here that ICAM-4 failed to interact with alpha4beta1 even after alpha4beta1 activation by phorbol ester or with the monoclonal antibody TS2/16 (+ Mn2+). ICAM-4 amino acids that are critical for alphaIIbbeta3 and alphaVbeta3 interaction were identified by domain deletion analysis, site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptide inhibition. Our results provide evidence that the beta3 integrin binding sites encompass the first and second Ig-like domains of ICAM-4. However, while the alphaIIbbeta3 contact site comprises the ABED face of domain D1 with an extension in the C'-E loop of domain D2, the alphaVbeta3 contact site comprises residues on both faces of D1 and in the C'-E loop of D2. These data, together with our previous results, demonstrate that different integrins bind to different but partly overlapping sites on ICAM-4, and that ICAM-4 may accommodate multiple integrin receptors present on leukocytes, platelets and endothelial cells.",European journal of biochemistry,2004
8550562,Integrin-associated protein is a receptor for the C-terminal domain of thrombospondin.,"The C-terminal ""cell-binding domain"" (CBD) of thrombospondin-1 (TS1) is a binding site for many cell types. Cell-binding peptides based on the sequence RFYVVM from the CBD of TS1 affinity label a 52-kDa cell surface glycoprotein, which we show is integrin-associated protein (IAP or CD47). IAP associates with alpha v beta 3 and thereby modulates the activity of several integrins. Cells that express IAP bind strongly to TS1, the CBD, and its active cell-binding peptides while IAP negative cells do not. The 52-kDa protein is affinity labeled on IAP-positive but not IAP-negative cells, and monoclonal antibodies against IAP specifically immunoprecipitate the affinity-labeled 52-kDa protein from lysates of IAP-positive cells. Consistent with the association of IAP with alpha v beta 3 integrin, the labeled 52-kDa protein is immunoprecipitated by an anti-alpha v beta 3 antibody. Endothelial cells exhibit chemotaxis toward TS1 (at concentrations above 10 nM) and RFYVVM peptides. Chemotaxis to both agents is specifically inhibited by a function blocking anti-IAP monoclonal antibody. These data establish IAP (CD47) as a receptor for the CBD of TS1 and suggest a mechanism for the well established effects of the CBD on cell motility.",,
11054877,Integrins as receptors for laminins.,"Laminins are a family of trimeric glycoproteins present in the extracellular matrix and the major constituents of basement membranes. Integrins are alpha beta transmembrane receptors that play critical roles in both cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. Several members of the integrin family, including alpha 1 beta 1, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 3 beta 1, alpha 6 beta 1, alpha 7 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4 heterodimers serve as laminin receptors on a variety of cell types. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the involvement of individual integrins in cell interactions with laminins and the roles of laminin-binding integrins in adhesion-mediated events in vertebrates, including embryonic development, cell migration and tumor cell invasiveness, cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as basement membrane assembly. We discuss the regulation of integrin function via alternative splicing of cytoplasmic domains of alpha and beta subunits of the integrin receptors for laminins and present examples of functional collaboration between laminin-binding integrins and non-integrin laminin receptors. Advances in our understanding of the laminin-binding integrins continue to demonstrate the essential roles these receptors play in maintaining cell polarity and tissue architecture.",Microscopy research and technique,2000
30759143,Interaction between nectin-1 and the human natural killer cell receptor CD96.,"Regulation of Natural Killer (NK) cell activity is achieved by the integration of both activating and inhibitory signals acquired at the immunological synapse with potential target cells. NK cells express paired receptors from the immunoglobulin family which share common ligands from the nectin family of adhesion molecules. The activating receptor CD226 (DNAM-1) binds to nectin-2 and CD155, which are also recognized by the inhibitory receptor TIGIT. The third receptor in this family is CD96, which is less well characterized and may have different functions in human and mouse models. Human CD96 interacts with CD155 and ligation of this receptor activates NK cells, while in mice the presence of CD96 correlates with decreased NK cell activation. Mouse CD96 also binds nectin-1, but the effect of this interaction has not yet been determined. Here we show that human nectin-1 directly interacts with CD96 in vitro. The binding site for CD96 is located on the nectin-1 V-domain, which comprises a canonical interface that is shared by nectins to promote cell adhesion. The affinity of nectin-1 for CD96 is lower than for other nectins such as nectin-3 and nectin-1 itself. However, the affinity of nectin-1 for CD96 is similar to its affinity for herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (HSV gD), which binds the nectin-1 V-domain during virus entry. The affinity of human CD96 for nectin-1 is lower than for its known activating ligand CD155. We also found that human erythroleukemia K562 cells, which are commonly used as susceptible targets to assess NK cell cytotoxicity did not express nectin-1 on their surface and were resistant to HSV infection. When expressed in K562 cells, nectin-1-GFP accumulated at cell contacts and allowed HSV entry. Furthermore, overexpression of nectin-1-GFP led to an increased susceptibility of K562 cells to NK-92 cell cytotoxicity.",,
7673114,Interaction between the components of the interferon gamma receptor complex.,"Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) signals through a multimeric receptor complex consisting of two different chains: the IFN-gamma receptor binding subunit (IFN-gamma R, IFN-gamma R1), and a transmembrane accessory factor (AF-1, IFN-gamma R2) necessary for signal transduction. Using cell lines expressing different cloned components of the IFN-gamma receptor complex, we examined the function of the receptor components in signal transduction upon IFN-gamma treatment. A specific IFN-gamma R2:IFN-gamma cross-linked complex was observed in cells expressing both IFN-gamma R1 and IFN-gamma R2 indicating that IFN-gamma R2 (AF-1) interacts with IFN-gamma and is closely associated with IFN-gamma R1. We show that the intracellular domain of IFN-gamma R2 is necessary for signaling. Cells coexpressing IFN-gamma R1 and truncated IFN-gamma R2, lacking the COOH-terminal 51 amino acids (residues 286-337), or cells expressing IFN-gamma R1 alone were unresponsive to IFN-gamma treatment as measured by MHC class I antigen induction. Jak1, Jak2, and Stat1 alpha were activated, and IFN-gamma R1 was phosphorylated only in cells expressing both IFN-gamma R1 and IFN-gamma R2. Jak2 kinase was shown to associate with the intracellular domain of the IFN-gamma R2.",,
7541556,Interaction of a tyrosine kinase from human sperm with the zona pellucida at fertilization.,"A 95-kilodalton mouse sperm protein with characteristics of a protein tyrosine kinase has been identified as a receptor for ZP3, a glycoprotein in the egg's extracellular matrix. The structure of the human homolog was determined by screening an expression library from human testis; a testis-specific complementary DNA was isolated that encodes a protein similar to receptor tyrosine kinases and appears to be expressed only in testicular germ cells. Antibodies against a synthetic peptide from the intracellular domain recognized a 95-kilodalton human sperm protein that contains phosphotyrosine; human ZP3 stimulates the kinase activity of this sperm protein. Synthetic peptides corresponding to regions of the predicted extracellular domain inhibited sperm binding to human zona pellucida. Availability of the primary sequence of a receptor for ZP3 provides a rational starting point for sperm-targeted contraceptive development.",,
12196113,Interaction of calcitonin-gene-related peptide with its receptors.,"The receptor for calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a heterodimer formed by calcitonin-receptor-like receptor (CRLR), a type II (family B) G-protein-coupled receptor, and receptor-activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), a single-membrane-pass protein. It is likely that the first seven or so amino acids of CGRP (which form a disulphide-bonded loop) interact with the transmembrane domain of CRLR to cause receptor activation. The rest of the CGRP molecule falls into three domains. Residues 28-37 and 8-18 are normally required for high-affinity binding, while residues 19-27 form a hinge region. The 28-37 region is almost certainly in direct contact with the receptor; 8-18 may make additional receptor contacts or may stabilize an appropriate conformation of 28-37. It is likely that these regions of CGRP interact both with CRLR and with the extracellular domain of RAMP1.",,
15246873,Interaction of Doppel with the full-length laminin receptor precursor protein.,"Doppel (Dpl) is a homolog of normal cellular prion protein (PrPc) with unknown functions. Ectopic expression of Dpl in the central nervous system (CNS) causes neurotoxicity and this effect is rescued by the expression of PrPc. However, the molecular basis for the protective effect of PrPc remains unclear. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we showed that Dpl binds the full-length 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor protein (LRP), one of the receptors of PrPc. The interaction was also validated by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using transfected cell lines and in vivo derived tissues. Further mapping experiments showed that although the middle fragment containing residues 100-220 of LRP was able to interact with Dpl, deletion of the N-terminal domain of the full-length LRP abolished its interaction with Dpl. These results suggest that while both PrPc and Dpl interact with LRP, the domains that are involved in the binding are not the same. Our results may have implications for the molecular mechanisms of Dpl-PrPc antagonism and physiological roles of Dpl.",Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,2004
11158588,Interaction of endostatin with integrins implicated in angiogenesis.,"Endostatin, a fragment of collagen XVIII, is a potent antagonist of angiogenesis and inhibitor of tumor growth in mouse models. At present, the mechanism of action of endostatin is unknown. We show here that recombinantly produced human endostatin interacts with alpha(5)- and alpha(v)-integrins on the surface of human endothelial cells. We further demonstrate that the endostatin-integrin interaction is of functional significance in vitro, as we found that immobilized endostatin supports endothelial cell survival and migration in an integrin-dependent manner. Soluble endostatin in turn inhibits integrin-dependent endothelial cell functions, such as cell migration. Taken together, these results implicate integrins as potential targets for endostatin function and support the importance of integrins in endothelial cell biology and angiogenesis.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2001
8001160,Interaction of endothelin-3 with endothelin-B receptor is essential for development of epidermal melanocytes and enteric neurons.,"Defects in the gene encoding the endothelin-B receptor produce aganglionic megacolon and pigmentary disorders in mice and humans. We report that a targeted disruption of the mouse endothelin-3 ligand (EDN3) gene produces a similar recessive phenotype of megacolon and coat color spotting. A natural recessive mutation that results in the same developmental defects in mice, lethal spotting (ls), failed to complement the targeted EDN3 allele. The ls mice carry a point mutation of the EDN3 gene, which replaces the Arg residue at the C-terminus of the inactive intermediate big EDN3 with a Trp residue. This mutation prevents the proteolytic activation of big EDN3 by ECE-1. These findings indicate that interaction of EDN3 with the endothelin-B receptor is essential in the development of neural crest-derived cell lineages. We postulate that defects in the human EDN3 gene may cause Hirschsprung's disease.",Cell,1994
10347172,Interaction of frizzled related protein (FRP) with Wnt ligands and the frizzled receptor suggests alternative mechanisms for FRP inhibition of Wnt signaling.,"Frizzled related proteins (FRPs) comprise a family of secreted molecules that contain an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) highly similar to the CRDs of the frizzled family of membrane-anchored Wnt receptors. FRPs have been shown to interact with Wnt proteins and antagonize Wnt signaling in a Xenopus developmental model. We demonstrated that FRP antagonizes the Wnt-induced increase in uncomplexed beta-catenin in both transient cotransfection and stable transformation models, where Wnt-induced morphological alterations are inhibited as well. We showed further that FRP inhibits Wnt signaling in a paracrine mode using a T-cell factor luciferase reporter to measure Wnt function. Investigation of the mechanisms responsible for FRP inhibition revealed that FRP forms complexes with WNT-1 or WNT-2 through its CRD domain. Transfection analysis with FRPs containing different tags revealed that FRP itself forms complexes and that this ability is conferred by its CRD domain. Finally, we demonstrated by cotransfection that FRP forms complexes with a prototype frizzled. All of these findings are consistent with a model by which FRP inhibits Wnt signaling through interactions with Wnt and/or formation of nonfunctional complexes with the frizzled receptor.",,
10364174,Interaction of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with its receptor. Evidence that Glu19 of G-CSF interacts with Arg288 of the receptor.,"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) forms a tetrameric complex with its receptor, comprising two G-CSF and two receptor molecules. The structure of the complex is unknown, and it is unclear whether there are one or two binding sites on G-CSF and the receptor. The immunoglobulin-like domain and the cytokine receptor homologous module of the receptor are involved in G-CSF binding, and Arg288 in the cytokine receptor homologous module is particularly important. To identify residues in G-CSF that interact with Arg288, selected charged residues in G-CSF were mutated to Ala. To clarify whether there are two binding sites, a chimeric receptor was created in which the Ig domain was replaced with that of the related receptor gp130. This chimera bound G-CSF but could not transduce a signal, consistent with failure of dimerization and loss of one binding site. The G-CSF mutants had reduced mitogenic activity on cells expressing wild-type receptor. When tested with the chimeric receptor, all G-CSF mutants except one (E46A) showed reduced binding, suggesting that Glu46 is important for interaction with the Ig domain. On cells expressing R288A receptor, all the G-CSF mutants except E19A showed reduced mitogenic activity, indicating that Glu19 of G-CSF interacts with Arg288 of the receptor.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
8157651,Interaction of hepatocyte growth factor with heparan sulfate. Elucidation of the major heparan sulfate structural determinants.,"We have demonstrated by affinity chromatography that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) binds strongly to heparan sulfate (HS). This substantiates previous suggestions that cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans constitute the so-called low affinity cellular binding sites for HGF. Using a recombinant human HGF affinity column, we have analyzed the effects of various specific chemical and enzymatic modifications/depolymerizations of HS on its affinity in order to elucidate the polysaccharide structural determinants. Interaction is shown to be only slightly affected by digestion with heparinase I or III or by replacement of N-sulfates with N-acetyl groups. This suggests a specific role for sulfated domains containing nonsulfated IdceA residues, with only a small contribution from N-sulfates and IdceA(2-OSO3) residues. In addition, disaccharide analyses of various HGF-binding oligosaccharides indicate that affinity is more closely associated with 6-O-sulfation of GlcNSO3 residues than with sulfation at any other position. Although interaction can be demonstrated with heparinase III-resistant oligosaccharides as small as hexasaccharides, the highest affinity was found with oligosaccharides containing a minimum of 10-12 monosaccharides. The structural specificity of the HGF-HS interaction is thus shown to be radically different from that previously described for the basic fibroblast growth factor-HS interaction.",,
17407096,"Interaction of HLA-B27 homodimers with KIR3DL1 and KIR3DL2, unlike HLA-B27 heterotrimers, is independent of the sequence of bound peptide.","HLA-B27 can form beta-2 microglobulin (beta2m)-associated heterotrimers (HLA-B27) and beta2m-free homodimers (B27(2)). Here, we study the role of complexed peptide in the interaction of these forms of B27 with the killer cell immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors KIR3DL1 and KIR3DL2 and with Ig-like transcripts LILRB1 and LILRB2. HLA-B27 tetramers complexed with three of five different naturally processed self peptides and three of seven pathogen-derived epitopes bound to KIR3DL1-expressing transfectants and NK cells. Heterotrimeric complexes containing peptides with charged amino acids at position 8 did not bind to KIR3DL1; however, studies with analogue peptides demonstrated that these are not the only peptide residues involved in binding. KIR3DL1 ligation by HLA-B27 inhibited NK cell IFN-gamma production in a peptide-dependent fashion. B27 but not HLA-A2, B7 or B57 heavy chains formed homodimers in the presence of peptide epitopes. B27(2) bound to KIR3DL1, KIR3DL2 and LILRB2 but not LILRB1. KIR3DL2 ligation by B27(2) inhibited NK and T cell IFN-gamma production. By contrast with HLA heterotrimers, B27(2) binding to KIR did not depend on the sequence of the bound peptide. Differences in KIR binding to classical HLA and B27(2) could be involved in the pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis.",,
18585785,Interaction of human PD-L1 and B7-1.,"Numerous studies have pointed to the role of programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) in regulating tolerance, chronic infection, and tumor immunity. Recently, we have identified murine B7-1 as a new binding partner for murine PD-L1. Human and mouse B7-1 share only 46% identity, leading us to question whether human B7-1 and PD-L1 can participate in a similar interaction. Here we show that human B7-1 can interact with human PD-L1 with affinity greater than that of B7-1 with CD28, but less than that of B7-1 with CTLA-4 or of PD-L1 with PD-1. We characterize a series of anti-human PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and identify antibodies that can block interactions of PD-L1 with B7-1, PD-1, or both. Since PD-L1 and CD28 on T cells may compete for B7-1 as a binding partner and CD8 T cells may express high or low levels of CD28, we examined when PD-L1 and CD28 are co-expressed on CD8 T cells. We compared the time-course and extent of PD-L1 induction on CD8 CD28high versus CD28low T cells following stimulation with anti-CD3. We show that PD-L1 is induced to a higher level on CD28high T cells than on CD28low T cells upon activation. These results suggest that PD-L1 may play an important and undervalued role on human T cells.",,
8568232,Interaction of IL-15 with the shared IL-2 receptor beta and gamma c subunits. The IL-15/beta/gamma c receptor-ligand complex is less stable than the IL-2/beta/gamma c receptor-ligand complex.,"This study was designed to compare the interactions of IL-2 and IL-15 with the IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma c subunits, as differences in receptor interactions between IL-2 and IL-15 might contribute to the functional differences between these two cytokines. The results suggest the existence of a human IL-15R alpha subunit, although physical evidence of this molecule was not obtained. Proliferation of anti-CD3 (OKT3)-stimulated human PBL was compared for responsiveness to IL-2, IL-15, and F42K, and IL-2 mutant that does not bind the IL-2R alpha chain. F42K was more potent than IL-15 in activating a dose-dependent response. This fact, along with Scatchard binding analyses of IL-15 on OKT3 blasts and YT cells revealing both high and intermediate affinity receptors, supports the existence of IL-15R alpha on these cells. Additional characterization of the IL-15R utilized covalent cross-linking to affinity label IL-2R and IL-15R on YT cells and OKT3 blasts. Consistent with previously reported functional data, IL-2R alpha was not co-precipitated from the [125I]IL-15 receptor-ligand complex, demonstrating that IL-15 does not interact physically with the IL-2R alpha subunit. While IL-2R alpha did co-precipitate with IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma c in the presence of IL-2, IL-15R alpha did not co-precipitate with the IL-2R beta/gamma c complex. Finally, YT cells equilibrated with IL-2 and then precipitated through IL-2R beta showed that IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma c co-precipitate in a 1:1 ratio, while only IL-2R beta was found in the immunoprecipitates of YT cells equilibrated with IL-15. This indicates that IL-15 creates a less stable bridge between the IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma c chains than does IL-2 on YT cells. This result was identical for both surface-iodinated YT cells and immunoprecipitates that were probed for IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma c on Western blots.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1996
10877843,"Interaction of junctional adhesion molecule with the tight junction components ZO-1, cingulin, and occludin.","Junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) is an integral membrane protein that has been reported to colocalize with the tight junction molecules occludin, ZO-1, and cingulin. However, evidence for the association of JAM with these molecules is missing. Transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with JAM (either alone or in combination with occludin) resulted in enhanced junctional localization of both endogenous ZO-1 and cotransfected occludin. Additionally, JAM was coprecipitated with ZO-1 in the detergent-insoluble fraction of Caco-2 epithelial cells. A putative PDZ-binding motif at the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of JAM was required for mediating the interaction of JAM with ZO-1, as assessed by in vitro binding and coprecipitation experiments. JAM was also coprecipitated with cingulin, another cytoplasmic component of tight junctions, and this association required the amino-terminal globular head of cingulin. Taken together, these data indicate that JAM is a component of the multiprotein complex of tight junctions, which may facilitate junction assembly.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
9726637,Interaction of lipophilic VIP derivatives with recombinant VIP1/PACAP and VIP2/PACAP receptors.,"Stearyl vasoactive intestinal polypeptide has been reported to be a VIP (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) receptor agonist of high potency with an original bioavailability and action. We synthesized three fatty acyl derivatives, myristyl-, palmityl- and stearyl-[Nle17]VIP, and tested their capacity to recognize recombinant rat- and human VIP1- and VIP2/PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide) receptors and to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity. The three lipophilic analogues bound with high affinity (from 0.5 to 20 nM) to both receptor subtypes but did not distinguish between them. In preparations expressing a high density of human VIP1/PACAP receptors, the three lipophilic analogues had the same efficacy as VIP and [Nle17]VIP. In preparations expressing the rat receptors, stearyl-[Nle17]VIP had a lower efficacy than the other peptides tested. In preparations expressing a low level of VIP1/PACAP receptors and in those expressing VIP2/PACAP receptors, all analogues behaved like partial agonists. The lowest efficacy was observed for stearyl-[Nle17]VIP on the VIP2/PACAP receptor subclass. Based on our results, a complex pattern of in vivo biological effects of the lipophilic VIP derivatives should be expected: these compounds might behave as full agonists, partial agonists, or antagonists of the VIP response, depending on the number and the subtype of receptor expressed.",,
9914169,Interaction of metargidin (ADAM-15) with alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1 integrins on different haemopoietic cells.,"Metargidin (ADAM-15) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease Domain) family of proteins and is widely expressed in different tissues and cell types. Members of this family contain an amino-terminal metalloprotease domain followed by a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region and a membrane proximal EGF-like domain. The disintegrin domain of metargidin contains an RGD tripeptide sequence, suggesting that it may potentially interact with the integrin family of proteins. Here we identify integrin ligands for metargidin on haemopoietic cells, by using a chimeric protein containing the extracellular domain of metargidin fused to the Fc portion of human IgG. Binding activity to a panel of human cell lines was analysed by solid-phase cell-adhesion assays. Metargidin bound to a monocytic cell line, U937, and a T cell line, MOLT-4, in a specific manner. Adhesion was divalent cation- and temperature- dependent and strongly enhanced by Mn2+, all features of integrin-mediated binding. Using a panel of anti-integrin antibodies we show that alphavbeta3 is a ligand for metargidin on U937 cells. In contrast, for MOLT-4 cells, the integrin alpha5beta1 contributes to cell binding. Adhesion was mediated by the disintegrin domain of metargidin as RGD-based peptides inhibited cell binding to both cell lines. The specificity of the interaction between both alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1 and metargidin was further confirmed by solid-phase adhesion assays using purified recombinant integrins. These results together indicate that metargidin can function as a cell adhesion molecule via interactions with alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1 integrins.",Journal of cell science,1999
10617658,Interaction of nectin with afadin is necessary for its clustering at cell-cell contact sites but not for its cis dimerization or trans interaction.,"We have recently found a novel functional unit of cell-cell adhesion at cadherin-based adherens junctions, consisting of at least nectin, a homophilic cell adhesion molecule, and afadin, an actin filament-binding protein, which connects nectin to the actin cytoskeleton. Here we studied a mechanism of cell-cell adhesion of the nectin-afadin system by use of a cadherin-deficient L cell line stably expressing the intact form of mouse nectin-2alpha, a truncated form of nectin-2alpha incapable of interacting with afadin (nectin-2alpha-DeltaC), or a point-mutated form of nectin-2alpha capable of interacting with afadin and a cadherin-expressing EL cell line, which transiently expressed the point-mutated form of nectin-2alpha. We found that the interaction of nectin-2alpha with afadin was necessary for their clustering at cell-cell contact sites. However, nectin-2alpha-DeltaC showed cis dimerization and trans interaction, both of which did not require the interaction of nectin-2alpha with afadin. We have previously shown in EL cells that the interaction of nectin-1 with afadin is necessary for its recruitment to adherens junctions. We found that the trans interaction of nectin-2alpha was furthermore necessary for this recruitment. On the basis of these observations, we propose a model for the mechanism of cell-cell adhesion of nectin and roles of afadin in this mechanism.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
14637022,Interaction of RANTES with syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 expressed by human primary macrophages.,"Interaction of RANTES with its membrane ligands or receptors transduces multiple intracellular signals. Whether RANTES uses proteoglycans (PGs) belonging to the syndecan family to attach to primary cells expressing RANTES G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) was investigated. We demonstrate that RANTES specifically binds to high and low affinity binding sites on human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). We show by co-immunoprecipitation experiments that RANTES is associated on these cells with syndecan-1 and syndecan-4, but neither with syndecan-2 nor with betaglycan, in addition to CD44 and its GPCRs, CCR5 and CCR1. Glycosaminidases pre-treatment of the monocyte derived-macrophages strongly decreases the binding of RANTES to syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 and also to CCR5, and abolishes RANTES binding to CD44. This suggests that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are involved in RANTES binding to the PGs and that such bindings facilitate the subsequent interaction of RANTES with CCR5, on the MDM, characterized by low membrane expression of CCR5. The role of these interactions in the pathophysiology of RANTES deserves further study.",,
12606621,Interaction of the growth hormone-releasing peptides ghrelin and growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 with the motilin receptor in the rabbit gastric antrum.,"The structural relationship between the motilin and the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), and between their respective ligands, motilin and ghrelin, prompted us to investigate whether ghrelin and the GHS-R agonist growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6), could interact with the motilin receptor. The interaction was evaluated in the rabbit gastric antrum with binding studies on membrane preparations and with contraction studies on muscle strips in the presence of selective antagonists under conditions of electrical field stimulation (EFS) or not. Binding studies indicated that the affinity (pK(d)) for the motilin receptor was in the order of ghrelin (4.23 +/- 0.07) < GHRP-6 (5.54 +/- 0.08) < motilin (9.13 +/- 0.03). The interaction of ghrelin with the motilin receptor requires the octanoyl group. Motilin induced smooth muscle contractile responses but ghrelin and GHRP-6 were ineffective. EFS elicited on- and off-responses that were increased by motilin already at 10(-9) M, but not by 10(-5) M ghrelin. In contrast, GHRP-6 also enhanced the on- and off-responses. The motilin antagonist Phe-cyclo[Lys-Tyr(3-tBu)-betaAla-] trifluoroacetate (GM-109) blocked the effect of GHRP-6 on the off-responses but not on the on-responses. Under nonadrenergic noncholinergic conditions, the effects of motilin and GHRP-6 on the on-responses were abolished; those on the off-responses were preserved. All responses were blocked by neurokinin (NK)(1) and NK(2) antagonists. In conclusion, ghrelin is unable to induce contractions via the motilin receptor. However, GHRP-6 enhances neural contractile responses, partially via interaction with the motilin receptor on noncholinergic nerves with tachykinins as mediator, and partially via another receptor that may be a GHS-R subtype on cholinergic nerves that corelease tachykinins.",,
3109943,Interaction of the human insulin receptor with the ras oncogene product p21.,"Autophosphorylation of the purified human insulin receptor tyrosyl kinase was found to be inhibited by the ras oncogene product p21 in a concentration- and GDP-dependent manner. GDP-beta-S but not Gpp(NH)p could substitute for GDP in eliciting the ras-dependent inhibition. The inhibition was seen with both normal or mutant (Lys-61) p21N-ras and normal or mutant (Val-12) p21Ha-ras. Inhibition occurred at 23 degrees C but not 4 degrees C and was unaffected by the presence or absence of insulin although insulin stimulated the autophosphorylation rate of the receptor beta-subunit some 2-fold. The insulin receptor did not phosphorylate native p21Ha-ras in the presence or absence of added guanine nucleotide.

9389482,Interaction of Wnt and a Frizzled homologue triggers G-protein-linked phosphatidylinositol signalling.,"In Drosophila, members of the frizzled family of tissue-polarity genes encode proteins that are likely to function as cell-surface receptors of the type known as Wnt receptors, and to initiate signal transduction across the cell membrane, although how they do this is unclear. We show here that the rat protein Frizzled-2 causes an increase in the release of intracellular calcium which is enhanced by Xwnt-5a, a member of the Wnt family. This release of intracellular calcium is suppressed by an inhibitor of the enzyme inositol monophosphatase and hence of the phosphatidylinositol signalling pathway; this suppression can be rescued by injection of the compound myo-inositol, which overcomes the decrease in this intermediate caused by the inhibitor. Agents that inhibit specific G-protein subunits, pertussis toxin, GDP-beta-S and alpha-transducin also inhibit the calcium release triggered by Xwnt-5a and rat Frizzled-2. Our results indicate that some Wnt proteins work through specific Frizzled homologues to stimulate the phosphatidylinositol signalling pathway via heterotrimeric G-protein subunits.",Nature,1997
9312147,Interactions between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the TRKB receptor. Identification of two ligand binding domains in soluble TRKB by affinity separation and chemical cross-linking.,"The extracellular domain of the human neurotrophin TRKB receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein, possessing binding ability for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Two distinct ligand binding domains of TRKB were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized BDNF. One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103-181 and contains both the third leucine-rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain. The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin-like domain (amino acid residues 342-394). Each of these two domains can bind BDNF independently. Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for BDNF binding, probably because of preservation of the native conformation. To study the second domain in greater detail, a truncated form of TRKB containing the second immunoglobulin-like domain (residues 248-398) was expressed in Escherichia coli. This domain was cross-linked to BDNF through a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling reaction. Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343-379 were able to bind immobilized BDNF. Amino acid substitution and cross-linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe347, Asp354, and Tyr361 are intimately involved in BDNF binding. These results, obtained from a variety of experimental techniques, highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the TRKB receptor in binding BDNF.",,
15745950,Interactions between ephrin-B and metabotropic glutamate 1 receptors in brain tissue and cultured neurons.,"We examined the interaction between ephrins and metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors in the developing brain and cultured neurons. EphrinB2 coimmunoprecipitated with mGlu1a receptors, in all of the brain regions examined, and with mGlu5 receptors in the corpus striatum. In striatal slices, activation of ephrinB2 by a clustered form of its target receptor, EphB1, amplified the mGlu receptor-mediated stimulation of polyphosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis. This effect was abolished in slices treated with mGlu1 or NMDA receptor antagonists but was not affected by pharmacological blockade of mGlu5 receptors. An interaction among ephrinB2, mGlu1 receptor, and NMDA was supported by the following observations: (1) the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors coimmunoprecipitated with mGlu1a receptors and ephrinB2 in striatal lysates; (2) clustered EphB1 amplified excitatory amino acid-stimulated PI hydrolysis in cultured granule cells grown under conditions that favored the expression of mGlu1a receptors; and (3) clustered EphB1 amplified the enhancing effect of mGlu receptor agonists on NMDA toxicity in cortical cultures, and its action was sensitive to mGlu1 receptor antagonists. Finally, fluorescence resonance energy transfer and coclustering analysis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells excluded a physical interaction between ephrinB2 and mGlu1a (or mGlu5 receptors). A functional interaction between ephrinB and mGlu1 receptors, which likely involves adaptor or scaffolding proteins, might have an important role in the regulation of developmental plasticity.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2005
16246332,Interactions of DC-SIGN with Mac-1 and CEACAM1 regulate contact between dendritic cells and neutrophils.,"Early during infection neutrophils are the most important immune cells that are involved in killing of pathogenic bacteria and regulation of innate immune responses at the site of infection. It has become clear that neutrophils also modulate adaptive immunity through interactions with dendritic cells (DCs) that are pivotal in the induction of T cell responses. Upon activation, neutrophils release TNF-alpha and induce maturation of DCs that enables these antigen-presenting cells to stimulate T cell proliferation and to induce T helper 1 polarization. DC maturation by neutrophils also requires cellular interactions that are mediated by binding of the DC-specific receptor DC-SIGN to Mac-1 on the neutrophil. Here, we demonstrate that also CEACAM1 is an important ligand for DC-SIGN on neutrophils. Binding of DC-SIGN to both CEACAM1 and Mac-1 is required to establish cellular interactions with neutrophils. DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin that has specificity for Lewis(x), and we show that DC-SIGN mediates binding to CEACAM1 through Lewis(x) moieties that are specifically expressed on CEACAM1 derived from neutrophils. This indicates that glycosylation-driven binding of both Mac-1 and CEACAM1 to DC-SIGN is essential for interactions of neutrophils with DCs and enables neutrophils to modulate T cell responses through interactions with DCs.",,
9020112,Interactions of mast cell tryptase with thrombin receptors and PAR-2.,"Tryptase is a serine protease secreted by mast cells that is able to activate other cells. In the present studies we have tested whether these responses could be mediated by thrombin receptors or PAR-2, two G-protein-coupled receptors that are activated by proteolysis. When added to a peptide corresponding to the N terminus of PAR-2, tryptase cleaved the peptide at the activating site, but at higher concentrations it also cleaved downstream, as did trypsin, a known activator of PAR-2. Thrombin, factor Xa, plasmin, urokinase, plasma kallikrein, and tissue kallikrein had no effect. Tryptase also cleaved the analogous thrombin receptor peptide at the activating site but less efficiently. When added to COS-1 cells expressing either receptor, tryptase stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. With PAR-2, this response was half-maximal at 1 nM tryptase and could be inhibited by the tryptase inhibitor, APC366, or by antibodies to tryptase and PAR-2. When added to human endothelial cells, which normally express PAR-2 and thrombin receptors, or keratinocytes, which express only PAR-2, tryptase caused an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. However, when added to platelets or CHRF-288 cells, which express thrombin receptors but not PAR-2, tryptase caused neither aggregation nor increased Ca2+. These results show that 1) tryptase has the potential to activate both PAR-2 and thrombin receptors; 2) for PAR-2, this potential is realized, although cleavage at secondary sites may limit activation, particularly at higher tryptase concentrations; and 3) in contrast, although tryptase clearly activates thrombin receptors in COS-1 cells, it does not appear to cleave endogenous thrombin receptors in platelets or CHRF-288 cells. These distinctions correlate with the observed differences in the rate of cleavage of the PAR-2 and thrombin receptor peptides by tryptase. Tryptase is the first protease other than trypsin that has been shown to activate human PAR-2. Its presence within mast cell granules places it in tissues where PAR-2 is expressed but trypsin is unlikely to reach.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
15695515,Interactions of multiple heparin binding growth factors with neuropilin-1 and potentiation of the activity of fibroblast growth factor-2.,"The hypothesis that neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) may interact with heparin-binding proteins other than vascular endothelial growth factor has been tested using an optical biosensor-based binding assay. The results show that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1, 2, 4, and 7, FGF receptor 1, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), FGF-binding protein, normal protease sensitive form of prion protein, antithrombin III, and Npn-1 itself are all able to interact with Npn-1 immobilized on the sensor surface. FGF-2, FGF-4, and HGF/SF are also shown to interact with Npn-1 in a solution assay. Moreover, these protein-protein interactions are dependent on the ionic strength of the medium and are inhibited by heparin, and the kinetics of binding of FGF-2, FGF-4 and HGF/SF to Npn-1 are characterized by fast association rate constants (270,000-1,600,000 m(-1) s(-1)). These results suggest that Npn-1 possesses a ""heparin"" mimetic site that is able to interact at least in part through ionic bonding with the heparin binding site on many of the proteins studied. Npn-1 was also found to potentiate the growth stimulatory activity of FGF-2 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells, indicating that Npn-1 may not just bind but also regulate the activity of heparin-binding proteins.",,
11980922,Interactions of thrombospondins with alpha4beta1 integrin and CD47 differentially modulate T cell behavior.,"Thrombospondin (TSP)-1 has been reported to modulate T cell behavior both positively and negatively. We found that these opposing responses arise from interactions of TSP1 with two different T cell receptors. The integrin alpha4beta1 recognizes an LDVP sequence in the NH2-terminal domain of TSP1 and was required for stimulation of T cell adhesion, chemotaxis, and matrix metalloproteinase gene expression by TSP1. Recognition of TSP1 by T cells depended on the activation state of alpha4beta1 integrin, and TSP1 inhibited interaction of activated alpha4beta1 integrin on T cells with its counter receptor vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. The alpha4beta1 integrin recognition site is conserved in TSP2. A recombinant piece of TSP2 containing this sequence replicated the alpha4beta1 integrin-dependent activities of TSP1. The beta1 integrin recognition sites in TSP1, however, were neither necessary nor sufficient for inhibition of T cell proliferation and T cell antigen receptor signaling by TSP1. A second TSP1 receptor, CD47, was not required for some stimulatory responses to TSP1 but played a significant role in its T cell antigen receptor antagonist and antiproliferative activities. Modulating the relative expression or function of these two TSP receptors could therefore alter the direction or magnitude of T cell responses to TSPs.",The Journal of cell biology,2002
11435317,Intercellular adhesion molecule-4 binds alpha(4)beta(1) and alpha(V)-family integrins through novel integrin-binding mechanisms.,"The LW blood group glycoprotein, ICAM-4, is a member of the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) family expressed in erythroid cells. To begin to address the function of this molecule, ligands for ICAM-4 on hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cell lines were identified. Peptide inhibition studies suggest that adhesion of cell lines to an ICAM-4-Fc construct is mediated by an LDV-inhibitable integrin on hemopoietic cells and an RGD-inhibitable integrin on nonhemopoietic cells. Antibody inhibition studies identified the hemopoietic integrin as alpha(4)beta(1.) Antibody inhibition studies on alpha(4)beta(1)-negative, nonhemopoietic cell lines suggested that adhesion of these cells is mediated by alpha(V) integrins (notably alpha(V)beta(1) and alpha(V)beta(5)). The structure of ICAM-4 modeled on the crystal structure of ICAM-2 was used to identify surface-exposed amino acid residues for site-directed mutagenesis. Neither an unusual LETS nor an LDV motif in the first domain of ICAM-4 was critical for integrin binding. ICAM-4 is the first ICAM family member shown to be a ligand for integrins other than those of the beta(2) family, and the data suggest that ICAM-4 has a novel integrin-binding site(s). These findings suggest a role for ICAM-4 in normal erythropoiesis and may also be relevant to the adhesive interactions of sickle cells.",,
9625760,Interferon-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC): a novel non-ELR CXC chemokine with potent activity on activated T cells through selective high affinity binding to CXCR3.,"Chemokines are essential mediators of normal leukocyte trafficking as well as of leukocyte recruitment during inflammation. We describe here a novel non-ELR CXC chemokine identified through sequence analysis of cDNAs derived from cytokine-activated primary human astrocytes. This novel chemokine, referred to as I-TAC (interferon-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant), is regulated by interferon (IFN) and has potent chemoattractant activity for interleukin (IL)-2-activated T cells, but not for freshly isolated unstimulated T cells, neutrophils, or monocytes. I-TAC interacts selectively with CXCR3, which is the receptor for two other IFN-inducible chemokines, the IFN-gamma-inducible 10-kD protein (IP-10) and IFN-gamma- induced human monokine (HuMig), but with a significantly higher affinity. In addition, higher potency and efficacy of I-TAC over IP-10 and HuMig is demonstrated by transient mobilization of intracellular calcium as well as chemotactic migration in both activated T cells and transfected cell lines expressing CXCR3. Stimulation of astrocytes with IFN-gamma and IL-1 together results in an approximately 400,000-fold increase in I-TAC mRNA expression, whereas stimulating monocytes with either of the cytokines alone or in combination results in only a 100-fold increase in the level of I-TAC transcript. Moderate expression is also observed in pancreas, lung, thymus, and spleen. The high level of expression in IFN- and IL-1-stimulated astrocytes suggests that I-TAC could be a major chemoattractant for effector T cells involved in the pathophysiology of neuroinflammatory disorders, although I-TAC may also play a role in the migration of activated T cells during IFN-dominated immune responses.",The Journal of experimental medicine,1998
10875937,"Interleukin (IL)-22, a novel human cytokine that signals through the interferon receptor-related proteins CRF2-4 and IL-22R.","We report the identification of a novel human cytokine, distantly related to interleukin (IL)-10, which we term IL-22. IL-22 is produced by activated T cells. IL-22 is a ligand for CRF2-4, a member of the class II cytokine receptor family. No high affinity ligand has yet been reported for this receptor, although it has been reported to serve as a second component in IL-10 signaling. A new member of the interferon receptor family, which we term IL-22R, functions as a second component together with CRF2-4 to enable IL-22 signaling. IL-22 does not bind the IL-10R. Cell lines were identified that respond to IL-22 by activation of STATs 1, 3, and 5, but were unresponsive to IL-10. In contrast to IL-10, IL-22 does not inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes in response to LPS nor does it impact IL-10 function on monocytes, but it has modest inhibitory effects on IL-4 production from Th2 T cells.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
11163236,"Interleukin 20: discovery, receptor identification, and role in epidermal function.","A structural, profile-based algorithm was used to identify interleukin 20 (IL-20), a novel IL-10 homolog. Chromosomal localization of IL-20 led to the discovery of an IL-10 family cytokine cluster. Overexpression of IL-20 in transgenic (TG) mice causes neonatal lethality with skin abnormalities including aberrant epidermal differentiation. Recombinant IL-20 protein stimulates a signal transduction pathway through STAT3 in a keratinocyte cell line, demonstrating a direct action of this ligand. An IL-20 receptor was identified as a heterodimer of two orphan class II cytokine receptor subunits. Both receptor subunits are expressed in skin and are dramatically upregulated in psoriatic skin. Taken together, these results demonstrate a role in epidermal function and psoriasis for IL-20, a novel cytokine identified solely by bioinformatics analysis.",Cell,2001
11706020,"Interleukin 24 (MDA-7/MOB-5) signals through two heterodimeric receptors, IL-22R1/IL-20R2 and IL-20R1/IL-20R2.","Interleukin 24 (IL-24) encodes a secreted protein that exhibits significant homology to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) family of cytokines. Here we show that the human IL-24 is secreted by activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and is the ligand for two heterodimeric receptors, IL-22R1/IL-20R2 and IL-20R1/IL-20R2. The latter is also the receptor for IL-20. COS cells transfected with either IL-24 receptor heterodimers bind the ligand with similar saturation kinetics. IL-24 binding to either its endogenous receptors on human keratinocytes or to ectopically expressed receptors on baby hamster kidney cells leads to activation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for IL-24 being the fourth member of IL-10 family of cytokines to which their specific receptors have been identified.",,
15184896,"Interleukin 31, a cytokine produced by activated T cells, induces dermatitis in mice.","T cell-derived cytokines are important in the development of an effective immune response, but when dysregulated they can promote disease. Here we identify a four-helix bundle cytokine we have called interleukin 31 (IL-31), which is preferentially produced by T helper type 2 cells. IL-31 signals through a receptor composed of IL-31 receptor A and oncostatin M receptor. Expression of IL-31 receptor A and oncostatin M receptor mRNA was induced in activated monocytes, whereas epithelial cells expressed both mRNAs constitutively. Transgenic mice overexpressing IL-31 developed severe pruritus, alopecia and skin lesions. Furthermore, IL-31 receptor expression was increased in diseased tissues derived from an animal model of airway hypersensitivity. These data indicate that IL-31 may be involved in promoting the dermatitis and epithelial responses that characterize allergic and non-allergic diseases.",,
1834644,Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist binds to the type II interleukin-1 receptor on B cells and neutrophils.,"We have examined the binding of human and rodent interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) to the type II IL-1 receptor on the human B cell line, Raji, on the mouse pre-B cell line, 70Z/3, and on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Human IL-1ra binds to the receptors on the human B cells with an affinity (KD = 15 +/- 3 nM) equal to that of IL-1 alpha and only 15-fold lower than that of IL-1 beta and, likewise, binds to human PMNs with an affinity (KD = 8 +/- 4 nM) 15-fold lower than that of IL-1 beta. Mouse and rat IL-1ra bind to these two human cell types with an affinity similar to that of the human protein. Human IL-1ra binds very weakly to the type II receptor on the mouse pre-B cells with an affinity (KD = 1.4 +/- 0.2 microM) about 1500-fold lower than human IL-1 beta. Mouse and rat IL-1ra also bind to the mouse pre-B cells with low affinity. The weak binding of the three IL-1ra proteins to these mouse cells appears to be more a consequence of the cell type rather than species specificity. There may be a population of cells for which the actions of IL-1 cannot be effectively opposed by IL-1ra, although this group does not include mature B cells and PMNs.",,
8332913,Interleukin-1 type II receptor: a decoy target for IL-1 that is regulated by IL-4.,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) interacts with cells through two types of binding molecules, IL-1 type I receptor (IL-1R I) and IL-1R II. The function of IL-1R II is unknown. In studies using monoclonal antibodies, IL-1 prolonged the in vitro survival of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) through IL-1R I, and IL-4 antagonized the action of IL-1 by inducing expression and release of IL-1R II. Dexamethasone also induced expression and release of the IL-1R II in PMN. These results, together with the effect of antibodies to IL-1R on IL-1-induced production of cytokines in monocytes, indicate that IL-1 acts on myelomonocytic cells through IL-1R I and that IL-1R II inhibits IL-1 activity by acting as a decoy target for IL-1. The existence of multiple pathways of regulation emphasizes the need for tight control of IL-1 action.",,
10948192,Interleukin-11 signals through the formation of a hexameric receptor complex.,"Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a member of the gp130 family of cytokines. These cytokines drive the assembly of multisubunit receptor complexes, all of which contain at least one molecule of the transmembrane signaling receptor gp130. IL-11 has been shown to induce gp130-dependent signaling through the formation of a high affinity complex with the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) and gp130. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified three distinct receptor binding sites of IL-11, which enable it to form this high affinity receptor complex. Here we present data from immunoprecipitation experiments, using differentially tagged forms of ligand and soluble receptor components, which show that multiple copies of IL-11, IL-11R, and gp130 are present in the receptor complex. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that sites II and III of IL-11 are independent gp130 binding epitopes and that both are essential for gp130 dimerization. We also show that a stable high affinity complex of IL-11, IL-11R, and gp130 can be resolved by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its composition verified by second dimension denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results indicate that the three receptor binding sites of IL-11 and the Ig-like domain of gp130 are all essential for this stable receptor complex to be formed. We therefore propose that IL-11 forms a hexameric receptor complex composed of two molecules each of IL-11, IL-11R, and gp130.",,
8920992,Interleukin-13 is a potent activator of JAK3 and STAT6 in cells expressing interleukin-2 receptor-gamma and interleukin-4 receptor-alpha.,"The lymphocyte growth factors interleukin-2 (IL2), IL4, IL7, IL9 and IL15 use the common IL2 receptor-gamma (IL2R gamma) and activate the IL2R gamma-associated tyrosine kinase JAK3 (Janus kinase 3). IL13 is structurally related to IL4, competes with IL4 for binding to cell surface receptors and exhibits many similar biological effects. The molecular basis for this functional overlap between IL4 and IL13 has been attributed mainly to a shared use of the 140 kDa IL4R alpha, since these cytokines appear to be uniquely different in that, according to several recent reports, IL13 does not recruit the IL2R gamma or JAK3. This notion has been supported by the identification of a novel 70 kDa IL13 receptor in certain IL13-responsive cell lines that lack IL2R gamma. The present study sheds new light on the issue of functional overlap between IL13 and IL4, by demonstrating for the first time that, in cells that express both IL2R gamma and IL4R alpha, IL13 can mimic IL4-induced heterodimerization of IL2R gamma and IL4R alpha, with consequent marked activation of JAK3 and the transcription factor STAT6 (IL4-STAT). Reconstitution experiments in BA/F3 cells showed that both cytokines require the simultaneous presence of IL4R alpha and IL2R gamma to mediate JAK3 and proliferative responses, and analysis of 12 IL4R alpha variants showed that IL4 and IL13 signals were equally affected by mutations of the cytoplasmic domain. We conclude that IL13 activates the IL2R gamma-associated JAK3 tyrosine kinase in appropriate cell types, and propose that IL13 is capable of interacting with multiple receptor subunits in a cell-dependent and combinatorial manner. Consequently, we predict that partial disruption of IL13 signal transduction also contributes to the severe combined immuno-deficiency syndromes associated with inactivation of the IL2R gamma or JAK3 genes.",,
9176231,Interleukin-15 signals T84 colonic epithelial cells in the absence of the interleukin-2 receptor beta-chain.,"Interleukin-15 (IL-15) shares many biological functions with interleukin-2 (IL-2) due to common receptor components. IL-15 binds to the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) beta-chain and the common gamma-chain receptor in addition to one other IL-15 binding receptor protein (IL-15R alpha). Both IL-2R beta- and gamma-chains are required to promote cell growth in hematopoietic cells. The colonic cryptlike epithelial cell line T84 contains the common gamma-chain but lacks the IL-2R beta-chain. We report IL-15R alpha-chain mRNA in T84 cells with the use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. T84 and normal colonic epithelial cells bind a FLAG-IL-15 fusion protein in immunoperoxidase and flow cytometric experiments. In addition, IL-15, but not IL-2, accelerates and enhances the development of transepithelial resistance across T84 monolayers in a dose-dependent fashion. We conclude that normal and T84 colonic epithelial cells express IL-15R alpha and are able to bind IL-15. IL-15 can deliver a nonproliferative functional signal in the absence of IL-2R beta-chain in T84 cells.",,
8266078,Interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain: a functional component of the interleukin-4 receptor.,"The interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor gamma chain (IL-2R gamma) is an essential component of high- and intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptors. IL-2R gamma was demonstrated to be a component of the IL-4 receptor on the basis of chemical cross-linking data, the ability of IL-2R gamma to augment IL-4 binding affinity, and the requirement for IL-2R gamma in IL-4-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1. The observation that IL-2R gamma is a functional component of the IL-4 receptor, together with the finding that IL-2R gamma associates with the IL-7 receptor, begins to elucidate why deficiency of this common gamma chain (gamma c) has a profound effect on lymphoid function and development, as seen in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.",,
9716487,Interleukin-6-type cytokine signalling through the gp130/Jak/STAT pathway.,"The family of cytokines signalling through the common receptor subunit gp130 comprises interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-1. These so-called IL-6-type cytokines play an important role in the regulation of complex cellular processes such as gene activation, proliferation and differentiation. The current knowledge on the signal-transduction mechanisms of these cytokines from the plasma membrane to the nucleus is reviewed. In particular, we focus on the assembly of receptor complexes after ligand binding, the activation of receptor-associated kinases of the Janus family, and the recruitment and phosphorylation of transcription factors of the STAT family, which dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to enhancer elements of respective target genes leading to transcriptional activation. The important players in the signalling pathway, namely the cytokines and the receptor components, the Janus kinases Jak1, Jak2 and Tyk2, the signal transducers and activators of transcription STAT1 and STAT3 and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 [SH2 (Src homology 2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase] are introduced and their structural/functional properties are discussed. Furthermore, we review various mechanisms involved in the termination of the IL-6-type cytokine signalling, namely the action of tyrosine phosphatases, proteasome, Jak kinase inhibitors SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signalling), protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIAS), and internalization of the cytokine receptors via gp130. Although all IL-6-type cytokines signal through the gp130/Jak/STAT pathway, the comparison of their physiological properties shows that they elicit not only similar, but also distinct, biological responses. This is reflected in the different phenotypes of IL-6-type-cytokine knock-out animals.",The Biochemical journal,1998
7522165,Interleukin-7 induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with the alpha chain of the interleukin-7 receptor.,"The recently characterized receptor for interleukin (IL)-7 (IL-7R) includes a unique alpha chain as well as a common gamma chain shared with the receptors for IL-2 and IL-4. Engagement of the IL-7R activates the intracellular enzyme phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase but the mechanism of PtdIns 3-kinase activation and the molecular basis of its interaction with IL-7R are not known. Here we show that IL-7 causes the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase (p85), and PtdIns 3-kinase activity, to associate with the IL-7R. This interaction can be ascribed to ligand-induced phosphorylation of a single Tyr residue in the receptor's unique alpha chain. Herbimycin A, a specific protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suppresses not only tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-7R but also its association with p85. A phosphopeptide corresponding to the sequence surrounding Tyr449 in the cytoplasmic tail of the IL-7R alpha chain, but not its non-phosphorylated analogue or phosphopeptides coincident with the sequences surrounding other alpha chain Tyr residues, efficiently competes out p85 binding. Replacement of Tyr449 with Phe results in a loss of p85 binding. Finally, soluble forms of the src homology 2 domains of p85, which bind directly to phosphotyrosyl peptides, specifically inhibit the association of p85 with the IL-7R. Thus, PtdIns 3-kinase recruitment occurs through a single, phosphotyrosine dependent recognition motif surrounding Tyr449 in the IL-7R alpha chain. This motif corresponds to a canonical sequence for p85 binding, Tyr(P)-X-X-Met. Since the closely related IL-2R and IL-4R also activate PtdIns 3-kinase but are devoid of such canonical motifs, our results suggest that the mechanism by which IL-7R recruits and activates PtdIns 3-kinase differs fundamentally from that used by the other receptors. PtdIns 3-kinase may, therefore, play a unique and important role in the biological response to IL-7.",,
11858939,Interleukin-7 receptor expression and activation in nonhaematopoietic neoplastic cell lines.,"The high-affinity human interleukin-7 (IL-7)R is a heterodimeric complex consisting of the IL-7Ralpha and common interleukin-2 receptor gamma (IL-2Rgamma(c)) chains. Activation of the IL-7R complex is associated with tyrosine and serine residue phosphorylation of a number of intracellular substrates leading to proliferation and induction of various cellular differentiation processes. In this study, we demonstrate, by S1 nuclease protection assay, immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assay that functional human (h) IL-7R is expressed in haematopoietic and nonhaematopoietic cell lines. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) tumour panel of 60 cell lines (NCI60) was screened for the expression of IL-7R mRNA by S1 nuclease protection assay, and IL-7R mRNA was detected in 9 of 12 leukemia, 3 of 7 lung, 4 of 6 CNS, 2 of 7 melanoma, 2 of 7 renal, 1 of 6 colon and 1 of 6 breast cancer cell lines. Immunoblot analysis of haematopoietic, lung cancer and brain tumour cell lines demonstrated expression of IL-7R, IL-2Rgamma(c) and p59 fyn, suggesting that the components of an IL-7R signalling network are present in nonhaematopoietic neoplastic cells. Immunoprecipitation of IL-7Ralpha followed by an in vitro kinase assay demonstrated functional receptor phosphorylation events in the lung cancer cells but not in the brain tumour cell lines. The expression of functional IL-7R on epithelial tumour cells may represent a potential target for receptor-directed therapy.",,
14527339,Interleukin-8 binds to syndecan-2 on human endothelial cells.,"Application of reverse transcription-PCR to total RNA prepared from TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor-alpha)-stimulated HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) revealed that the syndecan-2 mRNA was up-regulated by this inflammatory stimulus. By immunoprecipitation using an anti-syndecan-2 antibody on TNF-alpha-stimulated HUVEC lysates, inflammation-induced interleukin-8 was found to be an interaction partner of this HS (heparan sulphate) proteoglycan, but not of any other syndecan on these cells. The glycosylated [Syn2(ect)(+HS)] and non-glycosylated [Syn2(ect)(-HS)] forms of Syn2(ect) (the syndecan-2 ectodomain) were purified from a stably transfected human cell line and from a bacterial expression system respectively. By CD spectroscopy, Syn2(ect) was found to adopt an all-beta secondary structure. The dissociation constant of Syn2(ect)(+HS) with respect to interleukin-8 binding was determined by isothermal fluorescence titrations to be 23 nM. Despite its lack of HS chains, Syn2(ect)(-HS) exhibited significant binding to the chemokine, with a K (d) of >1 microM. Thus, in addition to glycosaminoglycan binding, protein-protein contacts might also contribute to the chemokine-proteoglycan interaction.",The Biochemical journal,2004
12351624,"Interleukins 19, 20, and 24 signal through two distinct receptor complexes. Differences in receptor-ligand interactions mediate unique biological functions.","Cytokines that signal through Class II receptors form a distinct family that includes the interferons and interleukin 10 (IL-10). Recent identification of several IL-10 homologs has defined a cytokine subfamily that includes AK155, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, and IL-24. Within this subfamily, IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 exhibit substantial sharing of receptor complexes; all three are capable of signaling through IL-20RA/IL-20RB, and IL-20 and IL-24 both can also use IL-22R/IL-20RB. However, the biological effects of these three cytokines appear quite distinct: immune activity with IL-19, skin biology with IL-20, and tumor apoptosis with IL-24. To more fully elucidate their interactions with the receptor complexes, we have performed a series of in vitro assays. Reporter, proliferation, and direct STAT activation assays using cell lines expressing transfected receptors revealed differences between the receptor complexes. IL-19 and IL-24 also exhibited growth inhibition on a cell line endogenously expressing all three receptor subunits, an effect that was seen at cytokine levels two orders of magnitude above those required for STAT activation or proliferation. These results demonstrate that, although this subclass exhibits receptor complex redundancy, there are differences in ligand/receptor interactions and in signal transduction that may lead to specificity and a distinct biology for each cytokine.",,
14615490,Intermedin is a calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide family peptide acting through the calcitonin receptor-like receptor/receptor activity-modifying protein receptor complexes.,"Calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), adrenomedullin (ADM), and amylin belong to a unique group of peptide hormones important for homeostasis in diverse tissues. Calcitonin is essential for calcium balance, whereas CGRP and ADM are important for neurotransmission and cardiovascular and respiratory regulation. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we identified intermedin as a novel member of the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family. Analysis of intermedin expression indicated that intermedin is expressed primarily in the pituitary and gastrointestinal tract. Intermedin increased cAMP production in SK-N-MC and L6 cells expressing endogenous CGRP receptors and competed with labeled CGRP for binding to its receptors in these cells. In addition, treatment of 293T cells expressing recombinant calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and one of the three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) showed that a CRLR/RAMP receptor complex is required for intermedin signaling. In contrast to CGRP and ADM, which exhibited a preferential stimulation of CRLR when co-expressed with RAMP1 and RAMP2 or RAMP3, respectively, intermedin represents a nonselective agonist for the RAMP coreceptors. In vivo studies demonstrated that intermedin treatment led to blood pressure reduction in both normal and spontaneously hypertensive rats via interactions with the CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes. Furthermore, in vivo treatment in mice with intermedin led to suppression of gastric emptying activity and food intake. Thus, identification of intermedin as a novel member of the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family capable of signaling through CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes provides an additional player in the regulation of peripheral tissues by CRLR and will allow development of new therapeutic agents for pathologies associated with diverse vascular and gastrointestinal disorders.",,
11300760,Intermolecular interactions between cholecystokinin-8 and the third extracellular loop of the cholecystokinin A receptor.,"The interaction of the C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin, CCK-8, with the third extracellular loop of human cholecystokinin-A receptor, CCK(A)-R(329-357), has been probed by high-resolution NMR and extensive computer simulations. The structure of CCK(A)-R(329-357) in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles consists of three alpha-helices, with the first and third corresponding to the extracellular ends of transmembrane (TM) helices 6 and 7. The central helix, residues W335-R345, is found to lie on the zwitterionic surface. Titration with CCK-8 produces a stable complex with a number of intermolecular NOEs between the C-terminus of the ligand (Trp(30), Met(31), Asp(32)) and the interface of TM6 and the third extracellular loop (N333, A334, Y338) of the receptor fragment. The mode of ligand binding based on these intermolecular NOEs is in agreement with a number of published findings from receptor mutagenesis and photoaffinity cross-linking. Utilizing these ligand/receptor points of interaction, the structural features of CCK(A)-R(329-357), and also the structures of CCK-8 and CCK(A)-R(1-47) previously determined, extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the CCK-8/CCK(A)-R complex were carried out. The results provide unique insight into the molecular interactions and forces important for the binding of CCK-8 to CCK(A)-R.",,
14991768,Internalization but not binding of thrombospondin-1 to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 requires heparan sulfate proteoglycans.,"The amino-terminal domain of the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) mediates binding to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) as well as binding to the endocytic receptor, low density lipoprotein-related protein (LRP-1). We previously found that recombinant TSP-1 containing the amino-terminal residues 1-214, retained both of these interactions (Mikhailenko et al. [1997]: J Biol Chem 272:6784-6791). Here, we examined the activity of a recombinant protein containing amino-terminal residues 1-90 of TSP-1 and found that this domain did not retain high-affinity heparin-binding. The loss of heparin-binding correlated with decreased binding to the fibroblast cell surface. However, both ligand blotting and solid phase binding studies indicate that this truncated fragment of TSP-1 retained high-affinity binding to LRP-1. Consistent with this, it also retained the ability to block the uptake and degradation of (125)I-TSP-1. However, TSP-1(1-90) itself was poorly endocytosed and this truncated amino-terminal domain was considerably more effective than the full-length heparin-binding domain (HBD) of TSP-1 in blocking the catabolism of endogenously expressed TSP-1. These results indicate that TSP-1 binding to LRP-1 does not require prior or concomitant interaction with cell surface HSPG but suggest subsequent endocytosis requires high-affinity heparin-binding.",Journal of cellular biochemistry,2004
24218476,International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. [corrected]. LXXXIX. Update on the extended family of chemokine receptors and introducing a new nomenclature for atypical chemokine receptors.,"Sixteen years ago, the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Pharmacology approved a system for naming human seven-transmembrane (7TM) G protein-coupled chemokine receptors, the large family of leukocyte chemoattractant receptors that regulates immune system development and function, in large part by mediating leukocyte trafficking. This was announced in Pharmacological Reviews in a major overview of the first decade of research in this field [Murphy PM, Baggiolini M, Charo IF, Hébert CA, Horuk R, Matsushima K, Miller LH, Oppenheim JJ, and Power CA (2000) Pharmacol Rev 52:145-176]. Since then, several new receptors have been discovered, and major advances have been made for the others in many areas, including structural biology, signal transduction mechanisms, biology, and pharmacology. New and diverse roles have been identified in infection, immunity, inflammation, development, cancer, and other areas. The first two drugs acting at chemokine receptors have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), maraviroc targeting CCR5 in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, and plerixafor targeting CXCR4 for stem cell mobilization for transplantation in cancer, and other candidates are now undergoing pivotal clinical trials for diverse disease indications. In addition, a subfamily of atypical chemokine receptors has emerged that may signal through arrestins instead of G proteins to act as chemokine scavengers, and many microbial and invertebrate G protein-coupled chemokine receptors and soluble chemokine-binding proteins have been described. Here, we review this extended family of chemokine receptors and chemokine-binding proteins at the basic, translational, and clinical levels, including an update on drug development. We also introduce a new nomenclature for atypical chemokine receptors with the stem ACKR (atypical chemokine receptor) approved by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Pharmacology and the Human Genome Nomenclature Committee.",Pharmacological reviews,2014
14507735,Interplay between rolling and firm adhesion elucidated with a cell-free system engineered with two distinct receptor-ligand pairs.,"The firm arrest of leukocytes to the endothelium during inflammation is known to be mediated by endothelial intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) binding to activated integrins displayed on leukocyte surface. Selectin-ligand interactions, which mediate rolling, are believed to be important for facilitating firm adhesion, either by activating integrins or by facilitating the transition to firm adhesion by making it easier for integrins to bind. Although leukocytes employ two distinct adhesion molecules that mediate different states of adhesion, the fundamental biophysical mechanisms by which two pairs of adhesion molecules facilitate cell adhesion is not well understood. In this work, we attempt to understand the interaction between two molecular systems using a cell-free system in which polystyrene microspheres functionalized with the selectin ligand, sialyl Lewis(X) (sLe(X)), and an antibody against ICAM-1, aICAM-1, are perfused over P-selectin/ICAM-1 coated surfaces in a parallel plate flow chamber. Separately, sLe(X)/P-selectin interactions support rolling and aICAM-1/ICAM-1 interactions mediate firm adhesion. Our results show that sLe(X)/aICAM-1 microspheres will firmly adhere to P-selectin/ICAM-1 coated surfaces, and that the extent of firm adhesion of microspheres is dependent on wall shear stress within the flow chamber, sLe(X)/aICAM-1 microsphere site density, and P-selectin/ICAM-1 surface density ratio. We show that P-selectin's interaction with sLe(X) mechanistically facilitates firm adhesion mediated by antibody binding to ICAM-1: the extent of firm adhesion for the same concentration of aICAM-1/ICAM-1 interaction is greater when sLe(X)/P-selectin interactions are present. aICAM-1/ICAM-1 interactions also stabilize rolling by increasing pause times and decreasing average rolling velocities. Although aICAM-1 is a surrogate for beta(2)-integrin, the kinetics of association between aICAM-1 and ICAM-1 is within a factor of 1.5 of activated integrin binding ICAM-1, suggesting the findings from this model system may be insightful to the mechanism of leukocyte firm adhesion. In particular, these experimental results show how two molecule systems can interact to produce an effect not achievable by either system alone, a fundamental mechanism that may pervade leukocyte adhesion biology.",,
15047175,"Intramembrane cleavage of ephrinB3 by the human rhomboid family protease, RHBDL2.","Rhomboid-1 is a serine protease that cleaves the membrane domain of the Drosophila EGF-family protein, Spitz, to release a soluble growth factor. Several vertebrate rhomboid-like proteins have been identified, although their substrates and functions remain unknown. The human rhomboid, RHBDL2, cleaves the membrane domain of Drosophila Spitz when the proteins are co-expressed in mammalian cells. However, the membrane domains of several mammalian EGF-family proteins were not cleaved by RHBDL2, suggesting that the endogenous targets of the human protease are not EGF-related factors. We demonstrate that the amino acid sequence at the luminal face of the membrane domain of a substrate protein determines whether it is cleaved by RHBDL2. Based on this finding, we predicted B-type ephrins as potential RHBDL2 substrates. We found that one of these, ephrinB3, was cleaved so efficiently by the protease that little ephrinB3 was detected on the surface of cells co-expressing RHBDL2. These results raise the possibility that RHBDL2-mediated proteolytic processing may regulate intercellular interactions between ephrinB3 and eph receptors.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2004
12882840,"Involvement of CD100, a lymphocyte semaphorin, in the activation of the human immune system via CD72: implications for the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses.","CD100/Sema4D belongs to the semaphorin family, factors known to act as repulsive cues for axons during neuronal development. Mouse CD100 plays a crucial role in both humoral and cellular immunity through ligation of the lymphocyte receptor, CD72. It remains controversial, however, whether human CD100 can function through human CD72 in a manner similar to mouse CD100. To determine the function of human CD100, we generated a recombinant soluble human CD100 protein comprised of the extracellular region of human CD100 fused to the human IgG1 Fc region (hCD100-Fc). hCD100-Fc specifically binds to cells expressing human CD72. As observed previously in the mouse, hCD100-Fc induces the tyrosine dephosphorylation of human CD72, leading to the dissociation of SHP-1 from the CD72 cytoplasmic tail. Consistent with findings for mouse CD100, hCD100-Fc exerts a co-stimulatory effect on B cells and dendritic cells that are stimulated with anti-CD40 mAb. Furthermore, both hCD100-Fc and anti-human CD72 agonistic mAb induce the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8, even in the absence of anti-CD40 mAb. Collectively, our findings not only demonstrate that human CD100, interacting with human CD72, can function as a ligand in a manner similar to mouse CD100, but also suggest the involvement of human CD100 in inflammatory responses.",International immunology,2003
17250899,Involvement of the SgIGSF/Necl-2 adhesion molecule in degranulation of mesenteric mast cells.,"Spermatogenic immunoglobulin superfamily (SgIGSF) expressed on nerve and mast cells, binds homophilically between both in culture. In the steady-state mesentery of mice, the proportion of morphologically degranulating mast cells was approximately 20%, and it increased nearly two-fold when the mesenteric nerve root was stimulated electrically. In contrast, there was no significant increase detectable in the mesentery of MITF-mutants, from which bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMMCs) lack SgIGSF. BMMCs from SgIGSF-knockout mice transplanted to the mesentery of mast cell-deficient W/W(v) mice did not degranulate in response to the mesenteric nerve stimulation, whereas transfection with SgIGSF cDNA restored those responses. SgIGSF appeared to promote communication between nerves and mast cells in the murine mesentery.",,
30550785,Irisin Mediates Effects on Bone and Fat via αV Integrin Receptors.,"Irisin is secreted by muscle, increases with exercise, and mediates certain favorable effects of physical activity. In particular, irisin has been shown to have beneficial effects in adipose tissues, brain, and bone. However, the skeletal response to exercise is less clear, and the receptor for irisin has not been identified. Here we show that irisin binds to proteins of the αV class of integrins, and biophysical studies identify interacting surfaces between irisin and αV/β5 integrin. Chemical inhibition of the αV integrins blocks signaling and function by irisin in osteocytes and fat cells. Irisin increases both osteocytic survival and production of sclerostin, a local modulator of bone remodeling. Genetic ablation of FNDC5 (or irisin) completely blocks osteocytic osteolysis induced by ovariectomy, preventing bone loss and supporting an important role of irisin in skeletal remodeling. Identification of the irisin receptor should greatly facilitate our understanding of irisin's function in exercise and human health.",,
8830783,Is plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 the molecular switch that governs urokinase receptor-mediated cell adhesion and release?,"Induction of the urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) promotes cell adhesion through its interaction with vitronectin (VN) in the extracellular matrix, and facilitates cell migration and invasion by localizing uPA to the cell surface. We provide evidence that this balance between cell adhesion and cell detachment is governed by PA inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). First, we demonstrate that uPAR and PAI-1 bind to the same site in VN (i.e., the amino-terminal somatomedin B domain; SMB), and that PAI-1 competes with uPAR for binding to SMB. Domain swapping and mutagenesis studies indicate that the uPAR-binding sequence is located within the central region of the SMB domain, a region previously shown to contain the PAI-1-binding motif. Second, we show that PAI-1 dissociates bound VN from uPAR and detaches U937 cells from their VN substratum. This PAI-1 mediated release of cells from VN appears to occur independently of its ability to function as a protease inhibitor, and may help to explain why high PAI-1 levels indicate a poor prognosis for many cancers. Finally, we show that uPA can rapidly reverse this effect of PAI-1. Taken together, these results suggest a dynamic regulatory role for PAI-1 and uPA in uPAR-mediated cell adhesion and release.",,
36746957,Isoform- and ligand-specific modulation of the adhesion GPCR ADGRL3/Latrophilin3 by a synthetic binder.,"Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are cell-surface proteins with large extracellular regions that bind to multiple ligands to regulate key biological functions including neurodevelopment and organogenesis. Modulating a single function of a specific aGPCR isoform while affecting no other function and no other receptor is not trivial. Here, we engineered an antibody, termed LK30, that binds to the extracellular region of the aGPCR ADGRL3, and specifically acts as an agonist for ADGRL3 but not for its isoform, ADGRL1. The LK30/ADGRL3 complex structure revealed that the LK30 binding site on ADGRL3 overlaps with the binding site for an ADGRL3 ligand - teneurin. In cellular-adhesion assays, LK30 specifically broke the trans-cellular interaction of ADGRL3 with teneurin, but not with another ADGRL3 ligand - FLRT3. Our work provides proof of concept for the modulation of isoform- and ligand-specific aGPCR functions using unique tools, and thus establishes a foundation for the development of fine-tuned aGPCR-targeted therapeutics.",,
9128259,Isolated P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 dynamic adhesion to P- and E-selectin.,"Leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium under flow involves an adhesion cascade consisting of multiple receptor pairs that may function in an overlapping fashion. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and L-selectin have been implicated in neutrophil adhesion to P- and E-selectin under flow conditions. To study, in isolation, the interaction of PSGL-1 with P- and E-selectin under flow, we developed an in vitro model in which various recombinant regions of extracellular PSGL-1 were coupled to 10-microm-diameter microspheres. In a parallel plate chamber with well defined flow conditions, live time video microscopy analyses revealed that microspheres coated with PSGL-1 attached and rolled on 4-h tumor necrosis factor-alpha-activated endothelial cell monolayers, which express high levels of E-selectin, and CHO monolayers stably expressing E- or P-selectin. Further studies using CHO-E and -P monolayers demonstrate that the first 19 amino acids of PSGL-1 are sufficient for attachment and rolling on both E- and P-selectin and suggest that a sialyl Lewis x-containing glycan at Threonine-16 is critical for this sequence of amino acids to mediate attachment to E- and P-selectin. The data also demonstrate that a sulfated, anionic polypeptide segment within the amino terminus of PSGL-1 is necessary for PSGL-1-mediated attachment to P- but not to E-selectin. In addition, the results suggest that PSGL-1 has more than one binding site for E-selectin: one site located within the first 19 amino acids of PSGL-1 and one or more sites located between amino acids 19 through 148.",The Journal of cell biology,1997
9792798,Isolation and characterization of a novel endogenous peptide ligand for the human APJ receptor.,"In the search for an endogenous ligand of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor APJ, the presence of the ligand in various tissue extracts was examined by measuring the increase in extracellular acidification rate of the cells expressing the APJ receptor as a specific signal induced by the interaction of the receptor and ligand. By monitoring this activity, we isolated an APJ receptor ligand, designated apelin, from bovine stomach extracts. The structures of bovine and human apelin preproproteins were deduced from the sequences of the corresponding cDNAs. The preproproteins consisted of 77 amino acid residues, and the apelin sequence was encoded in the C-terminal regions. Synthetic peptides derived from the C-terminal amino acid sequence of bovine preproapelin were capable of specifically promoting the acidification rate in the cells expressing the APJ receptor in a range from 10(-7) to 10(-10) M, indicating that apelin is an endogenous ligand for the APJ receptor.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1998
2169733,Isolation and functional expression of the human atrial natriuretic peptide clearance receptor cDNA.,"The amino acid sequence of the human atrial natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (ANP C-receptor) was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of cDNA clones obtained from human placental and kidney cDNA libraries. The human sequence is highly homologous to the bovine C-receptor sequence already described, and the corresponding mRNA is expressed in human placenta, adult and fetal kidney and fetal heart. Upon transfection of this cDNA into mammalian cells, recombinant expression experiments revealed that the human ANP C-receptor has a high affinity for ANP (6 x 10(-9) M), similar to that observed for the receptor in other species. These data indicate that the human ANP C-receptor, previously characterized in other mammalian species, is highly conserved structurally and is expressed in various human tissues.",,
12054613,Isolation and identification of EG-VEGF/prokineticins as cognate ligands for two orphan G-protein-coupled receptors.,"Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF, identical to prokineticin 1) is a novel peptide recently identified as a selective mitogen for endocrine gland endothelial cells. The present study demonstrates that EG-VEGF/prokineticin 1 and a peptide closely related to EG-VEGF, prokineticin 2, are cognate ligands of two orphan G-protein-coupled receptors designated ZAQ (=EG-VEGF/PK-R1) and I5E (=EG-VEGF/PK-R2). EG-VEGF/prokineticin 1 and prokineticin 2 induced a transient increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) with nanomolar potency in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing EG-VEGF/PK-R1 and -R2 and bind to these cells with high affinity and with different receptor selectivity. EG-VEGF/prokineticins provoke rapid phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase and DNA synthesis in the bovine adrenal capillary endothelial cells (BACE). The mRNAs of both EG-VEGF/PK-R1 and -R2 were expressed in BACE. The identification of the receptors for EG-VEGF/prokineticins may provide a novel molecular basis for the regulation of angiogenesis in endocrine glands.",,
8175719,Isolation of a neuronal cell surface receptor of heparin binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM). Identification as N-syndecan (syndecan-3).,"HB-GAM (heparin binding growth-associated molecule; pleiotrophin) is a secretory, extracellular matrix-associated protein that is strongly expressed in developing nervous tissues and belongs to a novel family of differentiation/growth factors. It promotes axonal growth from perinatal rat brain neurons and is suggested to be mitogenic for some cell types and to display cell-transforming activity. Since the receptors of HB-GAM in cells are unknown, we have started isolation of putative cell surface receptors from brain neurons and from perinatal rat brain. For this purpose, recombinant HB-GAM was produced with the aid of a baculovirus vector and used as an affinity matrix in receptor isolation. A detergent-solubilized component from cultured brain neurons and from brain was identified that binds specifically to HB-GAM and migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a broad smear with an apparent molecular mass of about 200 kDa. This cell surface component was found to contain heparan sulfate chains, which are bound to a core protein with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa. Gel electrophoretic characteristics, immunochemical analysis, and partial peptide sequencing revealed that the cell surface component isolated as an HB-GAM receptor is N-syndecan (syndecan-3). In a solid phase binding assay, N-syndecan was found to bind to HB-GAM in a similar manner as to basic fibroblast growth factor (KD = 0.6 nM). Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that in brain neurons, N-syndecan occurs at the surface of the cell soma and of the neurites that grow along HB-GAM-coated substrates. Anti-N-syndecan antibodies added to culture media had an inhibitory effect on HB-GAM-induced neurite outgrowth. We suggest that N-syndecan mediates the neurite outgrowth-promoting signal from HB-GAM to the cytoskeleton of growing neurites.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1994
1693626,Isolation of a novel integrin receptor mediating Arg-Gly-Asp-directed cell adhesion to fibronectin and type I collagen from human neuroblastoma cells. Association of a novel beta 1-related subunit with alpha v.,"We report the isolation from two human neuroblastoma cell lines of an Arg-Gly-Asp-dependent integrin complex capable of binding to vitronectin, fibronectin, and type I collagen. The two neuroblastoma cell lines, SK-N-SH and IMR-32, exhibit specific attachment to fibronectin and type I collagen. SK-N-SH cells exhibit a much stronger attachment to vitronectin than the IMR-32 cells, which attach poorly to this substrate. Affinity chromatography of octylglucoside extracts of 125I surface-labeled cells on GRGDSPK-Sepharose columns resulted in the specific binding and elution with GRGDSP of three radiolabeled polypeptides with relative molecular masses of 135, 115, and 90 kD when analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. In the SK-N-SH cells the 135- and 90-kD polypeptides were more abundant whereas in the IMR-32 cells the 135- and 115-kD polypeptides were more highly expressed. Liposomes prepared from fractions containing all three polypeptides bound to vitronectin, fibronectin, and type I collagen, whereas liposomes prepared from the 135- and 115-kD polypeptides bound only to fibronectin and type I collagen. Polyclonal antibodies against the alpha/beta complexes of both the vitronectin receptor and the fibronectin receptor immunoprecipitated all three polypeptides. A monoclonal antibody against beta 1 immunoprecipitated only the 135- and the 115-kD polypeptides, whereas a monoclonal antibody against beta 3 subunit immunoprecipitated the 135- and 90-kD polypeptides. Although, the 115-kD polypeptide could be recognized by an anti-beta 1 antibody, a comparison of peptide maps generated by V8 protease digestion of the 115-kD polypeptide and beta 1 subunit immunoprecipitated from GRGDSPK-Sepharose flow-through material indicated that these two polypeptides are distinct. Depletion of the 90-kD polypeptide with an anti-beta 3 monoclonal antibody did not effect the ability of the 115- and 135-kD polypeptides to bind to GRGDSPK-Sepharose. These data indicate that the SK-N-SH and IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells express a novel ""beta 1-like"" integrin subunit that can associate with alpha v and can bind to RGD. We propose to name this beta 1-like subunit beta n. The data reported here thus demonstrate that in these two cell lines alpha v associates with two beta subunits, beta n and beta 3, forming two heterodimers. The alpha v beta n complex mediates binding to fibronectin and type I collagen, whereas the alpha v beta 3 complex mediates binding to vitronectin.",The Journal of cell biology,1990

The structure of Angiopoietin-1 differs from that of known angiogenic factors or other ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases. Although Angiopoietin-1 binds and induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of TIE2, it does not directly promote the growth of cultured endothelial cells.

The identification of p150,95 as an iC3b-binding protein.","The proteins from labelled human spleen membranes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes which bind to the iC3b fragment of complement component C3 were prepared by iC3b-Sepharose chromatography in the presence of bivalent cations. Complement receptor type 3(CR3) was eluted from iC3b-Sepharose by removal of bivalent cations. Complement receptors type 1 and 2 (present in spleen but not in polymorphonuclear leucocytes) were sequentially eluted by an NaCl gradient. An additional protein of Mr 135 000 was eluted from iC3b-Sepharose under the same conditions as those used to elute CR3. Preabsorption of the starting material on an anti-(CR3 beta-subunit) antibody column before iC3b-Sepharose chromatography removed the alpha- and beta-chains of CR3 and the 135 000-Mr protein.

8559144,Isolation of LERK-5: a ligand of the eph-related receptor tyrosine kinases.,"Hek and elk are members of the eph-related family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Recently we isolated four cDNAs encoding membrane-bound ligands to hek and elk [Beckman et al. (1994) EMBO J. 13, 3757-3762; Kozlosky et al. (1995) Oncogene 10, 299-306]. Because of the promiscuous nature of their binding, we have termed these proteins ligands of the eph-related kinases or LERKs. A search of GenBank revealed an expressed sequence tag (EST) with homology to the LERKs. Using this EST as a probe, we have isolated human and murine cDNAs that encode a protein which we call LERK-5. The human and murine cDNAs encode proteins of 333 and 336 amino acids, respectively, with a 97% amino acid identity; LERK-5 has an amino acid identity of 27-59% with the other reported LERKs. LERK-5 is a ligand for both elk and hek and induces receptor phosphorylation. It is expressed in adult lung and kidney and the fetal tissues heart, lung, kidney, and brain. In addition, Southern blot analysis of DNA from interspecific backcross mice indicated that LERK-5 (Eplg5) maps to the proximal region of mouse chromosome 8.",Molecular immunology,1995

BMP-2 signals via oligomerization of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. We report here expression of the extracellular domain of the human type IA receptor for BMP-2 (BMPR-IA) in Escherichia coli. This soluble form of BMPR-IA (sBMPR-IA) was purified employing a BMP-2 affinity column.

The human homologue was obtained by screening a human chondrocyte library with a bovine cDNA probe. Cloning and cDNA sequence analysis of the human integrin alpha subunit designated alpha10 show that it shares the general structure of other integrin alpha subunits. The predicted amino acid sequence consists of a 1167-amino acid mature protein, including a signal peptide (22 amino acids), a long extracellular domain (1098 amino acids), a transmembrane domain (25 amino acids), and a short cytoplasmic domain (22 amino acids). The extracellular part contains a 7-fold repeated sequence, an I-domain (199 amino acids) and three putative divalent cation-binding sites. The deduced amino acid sequence of alpha10 is 35% identical to the integrin subunit alpha2 and 37% identical to the integrin subunit alpha1. Northern blot analysis shows a single mRNA of 5.4 kilobases in chondrocytes. A peptide antibody against the predicted sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of alpha10 immunoprecipitated two proteins with masses of 125 and 160 kDa from chondrocyte lysates under reducing conditions. The peptide antibody specifically stained chondrocytes in tissue sections of human articular cartilage, showing that alpha10 beta1 is expressed in cartilage tissue.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
7697721,Jagged: a mammalian ligand that activates Notch1.,"Here we report the isolation of a rat cDNA clone, Jagged, which we show encodes a ligand for vertebrate Notch. Our conclusion is based on three observations. First, sequence analysis reveals substantial homology between Jagged and invertebrate ligands for the LIN-12/Notch proteins. Second, in situ hybridization of rat embryos identifies both distinct and overlapping patterns of gene expression for Jagged with those for Notch1, Notch2, and Notch3. Finally, the biological activity of Jagged was tested using a cell culture assay in which Jagged activates rat Notch1 expressed in myoblasts and prevents muscle cell differentiation. Our data support the hypothesis that Notch-ligand interactions function in maintaining mammalian cells in an undifferentiated state.",Cell,1995
25119047,Jam1a-Jam2a interactions regulate haematopoietic stem cell fate through Notch signalling.,"Notch signalling plays a key role in the generation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during vertebrate development and requires intimate contact between signal-emitting and signal-receiving cells, although little is known regarding when, where and how these intercellular events occur. We previously reported that the somitic Notch ligands, Dlc and Dld, are essential for HSC specification. It has remained unclear, however, how these somitic requirements are connected to the later emergence of HSCs from the dorsal aorta. Here we show in zebrafish that Notch signalling establishes HSC fate as their shared vascular precursors migrate across the ventral face of the somite and that junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) mediate this required Notch signal transduction. HSC precursors express jam1a (also known as f11r) and migrate axially across the ventral somite, where Jam2a and the Notch ligands Dlc and Dld are expressed. Despite no alteration in the expression of Notch ligand or receptor genes, loss of function of jam1a led to loss of Notch signalling and loss of HSCs. Enforced activation of Notch in shared vascular precursors rescued HSCs in jam1a or jam2a deficient embryos. Together, these results indicate that Jam1a-Jam2a interactions facilitate the transduction of requisite Notch signals from the somite to the precursors of HSCs, and that these events occur well before formation of the dorsal aorta.",Nature,2014
10856295,Junctional adhesion molecule interacts with the PDZ domain-containing proteins AF-6 and ZO-1.,"We have identified the PDZ domain protein AF-6 as an intracellular binding partner of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), an integral membrane protein located at cell contacts. Binding of AF-6 to JAM required the presence of the intact C terminus of JAM, which represents a classical type II PDZ domain-binding motif. Although JAM did not interact with the single PDZ domains of ZO-1 or of CASK, we found that a ZO-1 fragment containing PDZ domains 2 and 3 bound to JAM in vitro in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. AF-6 as well as ZO-1 could be coprecipitated with JAM from endothelial cell extracts, demonstrating the association of the endogenously expressed molecules in vivo. Targeting of JAM to sites of cell contacts could be affected by the loss of the PDZ domain-binding C terminus. Full-length mouse JAM co-distributed with endogenous AF-6 in human Caco-2 cells at sites of cell contact independent of whether adjacent cells expressed mouse JAM as an extracellular binding partner. In contrast, truncated JAM lacking the PDZ domain-binding C terminus did not co-distribute with endogenous AF-6, but was restricted to cell contacts between cells expressing mouse JAM. Our results suggest that JAM can be recruited to intercellular junctions by its interaction with the PDZ domain-containing proteins AF-6 and possibly ZO-1.",,
7624359,"kappa-Opioid receptor in humans: cDNA and genomic cloning, chromosomal assignment, functional expression, pharmacology, and expression pattern in the central nervous system.","Using the mouse delta-opioid receptor cDNA as a probe, we have isolated genomic clones encoding the human mu- and kappa-opioid receptor genes. Their organization appears similar to that of the human delta receptor gene, with exon-intron boundaries located after putative transmembrane domains 1 and 4. The kappa gene was mapped at position q11-12 in human chromosome 8. A full-length cDNA encoding the human kappa-opioid receptor has been isolated. The cloned receptor expressed in COS cells presents a typical kappa 1 pharmacological profile and is negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. The expression of kappa-opioid receptor mRNA in human brain, as estimated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, is consistent with the involvement of kappa-opioid receptors in pain perception, neuroendocrine physiology, affective behavior, and cognition. In situ hybridization studies performed on human fetal spinal cord demonstrate the presence of the transcript specifically in lamina II of the dorsal horn. Some divergences in structural, pharmacological, and anatomical properties are noted between the cloned human and rodent receptors.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1995
10497191,Killer cell immunoglobulin receptors and T cell receptors bind peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I with distinct thermodynamic and kinetic properties.,"Human natural killer cells and a subset of T cells express a repertoire of killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs) that recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. KIRs and T cell receptors (TCRs) bind in a peptide-dependent manner to overlapping regions of peptide-MHC class I complexes. KIRs with two immunoglobulin domains (KIR2Ds) recognize distinct subsets of HLA-C alleles. Here we use surface plasmon resonance to study the binding of soluble forms of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL3 to several peptide-HLA-Cw7 complexes. KIR2DL3 bound to the HLA-Cw7 allele presenting the peptide RYRPGTVAL with a 1:1 stoichiometry and an affinity (K(d) approximately 7 microM at 25 degrees C) within the range of values measured for other cell-cell recognition molecules, including the TCR. Although KIR2DL1 is reported not to recognize the HLA-Cw7 allele in functional assays, it bound RYRPGTVAL/HLA-Cw7, albeit with a 10-20-fold lower affinity. TCR/peptide-MHC interactions are characterized by comparatively slow kinetics and unfavorable entropic changes (Willcox, B. E., Gao, G. F., Wyer, J. R. , Ladbury, J. E., Bell, J. I., Jakobsen, B. K., and van der Merwe, P. A. (1999) Immunity 10, 357-365), suggesting that binding is accompanied by conformational adjustments. In contrast, we show that KIR2DL3 binds RYRPGTVAL/HLA-Cw7 with fast kinetics and a favorable binding entropy, consistent with rigid body association. These results indicate that KIR/peptide-MHC class I interactions have properties typical of other cell-cell recognition molecules, and they highlight the unusual nature of TCR/peptide-MHC recognition.",,
10572088,Kinetic resolution of two mechanisms for high-affinity granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor binding to its receptor.,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an important hematopoietic cytokine that exerts its effects by interaction with the GM-CSF receptor (GMR) on the surface of responsive cells. The GM-CSF receptor consists of two subunits: GMRalpha, which binds GM-CSF with low affinity, and GMRbeta, which lacks intrinsic ligand-binding capability but complexes with GMRalpha to form a high-affinity receptor (GMRalpha/beta). We conducted dynamic kinetic analyses of GM-CSF receptors to define the role of GMRbeta in the interaction of ligand and receptor. Our data show that GMRalpha/beta exhibits a higher k(on) than GMRalpha, indicating that GMRbeta facilitates ligand acquisition to the binding pocket. Heterogeneity with regard to GM-CSF dissociation from GMRalpha/beta points to the presence of loose and tight ligand-receptor complexes in high-affinity binding. Although the loose complex has a k(off) similar to GMRalpha, the lower k(off) indicates that GMRbeta inhibits GM-CSF release from the tight receptor complex. The two rates of ligand dissociation may provide for discrete mechanisms of interaction between GM-CSF and its high-affinity receptor. These results show that the beta subunit functions to stabilize ligand binding as well as to facilitate ligand acquisition.",Blood,1999

Using soluble, recombinant HLA-C molecules and NK inhibitory receptors (NKIR, members of the immunoglobulin superfamily), we show that HLA-C binds to NKIR molecules with extremely fast association and dissociation rates, among the fastest of the immune system interactions so far studied. These kinetics may be essential for the biological function of NK cells, i.e., to facilitate the rapid immunosurveillance of cells for absent or diminished expression of class I MHC proteins.",Immunity,1998
15665093,Kisspeptin directly stimulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone release via G protein-coupled receptor 54.,"We have recently described a molecular gatekeeper of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis with the observation that G protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPR54) is required in mice and men for the pubertal onset of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion to occur. In the present study, we investigate the possible central mode of action of GPR54 and kisspeptin ligand. First, we show that GPR54 transcripts are colocalized with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in the mouse hypothalamus, suggesting that kisspeptin, the GPR54 ligand, may act directly on these neurons. Next, we show that GnRH neurons seem anatomically normal in gpr54-/- mice, and that they show projections to the median eminence, which demonstrates that the hypogonadism in gpr54-/- mice is not due to an abnormal migration of GnRH neurons (as occurs with KAL1 mutations), but that it is more likely due to a lack of GnRH release or absence of GnRH neuron stimulation. We also show that levels of kisspeptin injected i.p., which stimulate robust LH and FSH release in wild-type mice, have no effect in gpr54-/- mice, and therefore that kisspeptin acts directly and uniquely by means of GPR54 signaling for this function. Finally, we demonstrate by direct measurement, that the central administration of kisspeptin intracerebroventricularly in sheep produces a dramatic release of GnRH into the cerebrospinal fluid, with a parallel rise in serum LH, demonstrating that a key action of kisspeptin on the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis occurs directly at the level of GnRH release. The localization and GnRH release effects of kisspeptin thus define GPR54 as a major control point in the reproductive axis and suggest kisspeptin to be a neurohormonal effector.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2005
12050670,Kremen proteins are Dickkopf receptors that regulate Wnt/beta-catenin signalling.,"The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins mediate cell cell interactions during cell growth and differentiation in both embryos and adults. Canonical Wnt signalling by way of the beta-catenin pathway is transduced by two receptor families. Frizzled proteins and lipoprotein-receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) bind Wnts and transmit their signal by stabilizing intracellular beta-catenin. Wnt/beta-catenin signalling is inhibited by the secreted protein Dickkopf1 (Dkk1), a member of a multigene family, which induces head formation in amphibian embryos. Dkk1 has been shown to inhibit Wnt signalling by binding to and antagonizing LRP5/6. Here we show that the transmembrane proteins Kremen1 and Kremen2 are high-affinity Dkk1 receptors that functionally cooperate with Dkk1 to block Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Kremen2 forms a ternary complex with Dkk1 and LRP6, and induces rapid endocytosis and removal of the Wnt receptor LRP6 from the plasma membrane. The results indicate that Kremen1 and Kremen2 are components of a membrane complex modulating canonical Wnt signalling through LRP6 in vertebrates.",Nature,2002
12527209,Kremen2 modulates Dickkopf2 activity during Wnt/LRP6 signaling.,"Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) is a secreted antagonist of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway that acts by direct binding to and inhibiting the Wnt co-receptor LRP6. The related Dkk2, however, can function either as LRP6 agonist or antagonist, depending on the cellular context, suggesting that its activity is modulated by unknown co-factors. We have recently identified the transmembrane proteins Kremen1 and -2 as additional Dkk receptors, which bind to both Dkk1 and Dkk2 with high affinity. Here we show that Kremen2 (Krm2) regulates Dkk2 activity during Wnt signaling. In human 293 fibroblasts transfected dkk2 activates LRP6 signaling. However, co-transfection of krm2 blocks the ability of Dkk2 to activate LRP6 and enhances inhibition of Wnt/Frizzled signaling. Krm2 also co-operates with Dkk4 to inhibit Wnt signaling, but not with Dkk3, which has no effect on Wnt signaling. Likewise, in Xenopus embryos, Dkk2 and Krm2 co-operate in Wnt inhibition leading to anteriorized embryos. Finally, we show that interaction with Krm2 is mediated by the second cysteine-rich domain of Dkks. These results suggest that Krm2 can function as a switch that turns Dkk2 from an activator into an inhibitor of Wnt/lRP6 signaling.",Gene,2003
22815787,L1CAM binds ErbB receptors through Ig-like domains coupling cell adhesion and neuregulin signalling.,"During nervous system development different cell-to-cell communication mechanisms operate in parallel guiding migrating neurons and growing axons to generate complex arrays of neural circuits. How such a system works in coordination is not well understood. Cross-regulatory interactions between different signalling pathways and redundancy between them can increase precision and fidelity of guidance systems. Immunoglobulin superfamily proteins of the NCAM and L1 families couple specific substrate recognition and cell adhesion with the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases. Thus it has been shown that L1CAM-mediated cell adhesion promotes the activation of the EGFR (erbB1) from Drosophila to humans. Here we explore the specificity of the molecular interaction between L1CAM and the erbB receptor family. We show that L1CAM binds physically erbB receptors in both heterologous systems and the mammalian developing brain. Different Ig-like domains located in the extracellular part of L1CAM can support this interaction. Interestingly, binding of L1CAM to erbB enhances its response to neuregulins. During development this may synergize with the activation of erbB receptors through L1CAM homophilic interactions, conferring diffusible neuregulins specificity for cells or axons that interact with the substrate through L1CAM.",PloS one,2012
9423932,"Labelling of CRF1 and CRF2 receptors using the novel radioligand, [3H]-urocortin.","The binding of the novel radioligand, [3H]-rat urocortin to homogenates of rat cerebellum and homogenates of cells stably transfected with the human CRF1, rat CRF2alpha and rat CRF2beta receptors was examined. In each case, specific reversible high affinity binding was observed (K[d]s between 0.18 and 0.31 nM). The density of sites was relatively low in the cerebellum (9 fmol/mg tissue) but high in the recombinant systems with expression levels of between 1.4 and 6.3 pmol/mg protein. Agents known to interact with CRF receptors potently competed for binding in each case. The pharmacological profile of binding to the recombinant receptors were consistent with data previously published using other radioligands. Thus, for the recombinant CRF1 receptor, binding was inhibited with similar affinity by Urocortin, sauvagine, Urotensin 1 and CRF. The non-peptidic CRF antagonists (e.g. CP 154,526 and SC 241) also potently inhibited binding. The CRF2alpha and CRF2beta receptor recombinant systems had a very similar pharmacological profile with a clear rank order of potency for the peptide ligands (Urocortin > Sauvagine > Urotensin 1 > CRF), whereas the non-peptide CRF receptor antagonists had no measurable affinity. The pharmacological profile of specific [3H]-urocortin binding to homogentates of rat cerebellum was consistent with specific labelling of a CRF1 receptor. We conclude that [3H]-urocortin is a useful tool for the study of CRF receptors with the advantages that a filtration assay can be used, all CRF receptors can be labelled with the same ligand and the benefits associated with the low energy emittor, 3H.",Neuropharmacology,1997

The dystroglycan-matrix interaction is essential for muscle function: disrupted biosynthesis of the matrix-binding modification causes several forms of muscular dystrophy. The complete chemical structure of this modification has been deciphered in the past few years. We now know that LG domains bind to a glycosaminoglycan-like polysaccharide of [-3GlcAβ1,3Xylα1-] units, termed matriglycan, that is attached to a highly unusual heptasaccharide linker.

The widespread occurrence of HB-EGF in cell and tissue types has led to observations of its role in such cellular and tissue events as tumor formation, cell migration, extracellular matrix formation, wound healing, and cell adherence. Several studies have reported the involvement of such extracellular matrix proteins as latent transforming growth factor beta-binding protein, TGF-beta, and fibulin-1 in some of these processes. To determine whether HB-EGF interacts with extracellular matrix proteins we used the extracellular domain of proHB-EGF in a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a monkey kidney cDNA library. cDNA clones containing nucleotide sequences encoding domains of two proteins were obtained and their derived amino acid sequences were evaluated.",BMC cell biology,2002
21724987,Latrophilin 1 and its endogenous ligand Lasso/teneurin-2 form a high-affinity transsynaptic receptor pair with signaling capabilities.,"Latrophilin 1 (LPH1), a neuronal receptor of α-latrotoxin, is implicated in neurotransmitter release and control of presynaptic Ca(2+). As an ""adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor,"" LPH1 can convert cell surface interactions into intracellular signaling. To examine the physiological functions of LPH1, we used LPH1's extracellular domain to purify its endogenous ligand. A single protein of ∼275 kDa was isolated from rat brain and termed Lasso. Peptide sequencing and molecular cloning have shown that Lasso is a splice variant of teneurin-2, a brain-specific orphan cell surface receptor with a function in neuronal pathfinding and synaptogenesis. We show that LPH1 and Lasso interact strongly and specifically. They are always copurified from rat brain extracts. Coculturing cells expressing LPH1 with cells expressing Lasso leads to their mutual attraction and formation of multiple junctions to which both proteins are recruited. Cells expressing LPH1 form chimerical synapses with hippocampal neurons in cocultures; LPH1 and postsynaptic neuronal protein PSD-95 accumulate on opposite sides of these structures. Immunoblotting and immunoelectron microscopy of purified synapses and immunostaining of cultured hippocampal neurons show that LPH1 and Lasso are enriched in synapses; in both systems, LPH1 is presynaptic, whereas Lasso is postsynaptic. A C-terminal fragment of Lasso interacts with LPH1 and induces Ca(2+) signals in presynaptic boutons of hippocampal neurons and in neuroblastoma cells expressing LPH1. Thus, LPH1 and Lasso can form transsynaptic complexes capable of inducing presynaptic Ca(2+) signals, which might affect synaptic functions.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2011
24273166,Latrophilins function as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules by binding to teneurins: regulation by alternative splicing.,"Latrophilin-1, -2, and -3 are adhesion-type G protein-coupled receptors that are auxiliary α-latrotoxin receptors, suggesting that they may have a synaptic function. Using pulldowns, we here identify teneurins, type II transmembrane proteins that are also candidate synaptic cell-adhesion molecules, as interactors for the lectin-like domain of latrophilins. We show that teneurin binds to latrophilins with nanomolar affinity and that this binding mediates cell adhesion, consistent with a role of teneurin binding to latrophilins in trans-synaptic interactions. All latrophilins are subject to alternative splicing at an N-terminal site; in latrophilin-1, this alternative splicing modulates teneurin binding but has no effect on binding of latrophilin-1 to another ligand, FLRT3. Addition to cultured neurons of soluble teneurin-binding fragments of latrophilin-1 decreased synapse density, suggesting that latrophilin binding to teneurin may directly or indirectly influence synapse formation and/or maintenance. These observations are potentially intriguing in view of the proposed role for Drosophila teneurins in determining synapse specificity. However, teneurins in Drosophila were suggested to act as homophilic cell-adhesion molecules, whereas our findings suggest a heterophilic interaction mechanism. Thus, we tested whether mammalian teneurins also are homophilic cell-adhesion molecules, in addition to binding to latrophilins as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules. Strikingly, we find that although teneurins bind to each other in solution, homophilic teneurin-teneurin binding is unable to support stable cell adhesion, different from heterophilic teneurin-latrophilin binding. Thus, mammalian teneurins act as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules that may be involved in trans-neuronal interaction processes such as synapse formation or maintenance.",,
10364178,"LD78beta, a non-allelic variant of human MIP-1alpha (LD78alpha), has enhanced receptor interactions and potent HIV suppressive activity.","Chemokines play diverse roles in inflammatory and non-inflammatory situations via activation of heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptors. Also, many chemokine receptors can act as cofactors for cellular entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro. CCR5, a receptor for chemokines MIP-1alpha (LD78alpha), MIP-1beta, RANTES, and MCP2, is of particular importance in vivo as polymorphisms in this gene affect HIV infection and rate of progression to AIDS. Moreover, the CCR5 ligands can prevent HIV entry through this receptor and likely contribute to the control of HIV infection. Here we show that a non-allelic isoform of human MIP-1alpha (LD78alpha), termed LD78beta or MIP-1alphaP, has enhanced receptor binding affinities to CCR5 (approximately 6-fold) and the promiscuous beta-chemokine receptor, D6 (approximately 15-20-fold). We demonstrate that a proline residue at position 2 of MIP-1alphaP is responsible for this enhanced activity. Moreover, MIP-1alphaP is by far the most potent natural CCR5 agonist described to date, and importantly, displays markedly higher HIV1 suppressive activity than all other human MIP-1alpha isoforms examined. In addition, while RANTES has been described as the most potent inhibitor of CCR5-mediated HIV entry, MIP-1alphaP was as potent as, if not more potent than, RANTES in HIV-1 suppressive assays. This property suggests that MIP-1alphaP may be of importance in controlling viral spread in HIV-infected individuals.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
15840700,LDL receptor cooperates with LDL receptor-related protein in regulating plasma levels of coagulation factor VIII in vivo.,"Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) and LDLR-related protein (LRP) are members of the LDLR family of endocytic receptors. LRP recognizes a wide spectrum of structurally and functionally unrelated ligands, including coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). In contrast, the ligand specificity of LDLR is restricted to apolipoproteins E and B-100. Ligand binding to the LDLR family is inhibited by receptor-associated protein (RAP). We have previously reported that, apart from LRP, other RAP-sensitive mechanisms contribute to the regulation of FVIII in vivo. In the present study, we showed that the extracellular ligand-binding domain of LDLR interacts with FVIII in vitro and that binding was inhibited by RAP. The physiologic relevance of the FVIII-LDLR interaction was addressed using mouse models of LDLR or hepatic LRP deficiency. In the absence of hepatic LRP, LDLR played a dominant role in the regulation and clearance of FVIII in vivo. Furthermore, FVIII clearance was accelerated after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of LDLR. The role of LDLR in FVIII catabolism was not secondary to increased plasma lipoproteins or to changes in lipoprotein profiles. We propose that LDLR acts in concert with LRP in regulating plasma levels of FVIII in vivo. This represents a previously unrecognized link between LDLR and hemostasis.",,

SDS-PAGE followed by protein sequence analysis revealed the presence of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) and NCAM in the fraction. The dissociation constant of binding between LRP and MK was 3.5 nM. Receptor-associated protein (RAP), which interfered with the binding, inhibited MK-dependent survival of embryonic neurons. Brushin/megalin, which is also a high molecular weight protein belonging to the LDL receptor family, bound to MK less strongly than LRP.

APPs770 degradation is inhibited by an LRP antagonist called the receptor-associated protein (RAP) and by LRP antibodies and is greatly diminished in fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP. APPs695, which lacks the KPI domain, is a poor LRP ligand. Since LRP also binds apolipoprotein E (apoE)-enriched lipoproteins and inheritance of the epsilon 4 allele of the apoE gene is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), these data link in a single metabolic pathway two molecules strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of AD.",Cell,1995
11357136,LDL-receptor-related protein 6 is a receptor for Dickkopf proteins.,"Wnt glycoproteins have been implicated in diverse processes during embryonic patterning in metazoa. They signal through frizzled-type seven-transmembrane-domain receptors to stabilize beta-catenin. Wnt signalling is antagonized by the extracellular Wnt inhibitor dickkopf1 (dkk1), which is a member of a multigene family. dkk1 was initially identified as a head inducer in Xenopus embryos but the mechanism by which it blocks Wnt signalling is unknown. LDL-receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is required during Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in Drosophila, Xenopus and mouse, possibly acting as a co-receptor for Wnt. Here we show that LRP6 (ref. 7) is a specific, high-affinity receptor for Dkk1 and Dkk2. Dkk1 blocks LRP6-mediated Wnt/beta-catenin signalling by interacting with domains that are distinct from those required for Wnt/Frizzled interaction. dkk1 and LRP6 interact antagonistically during embryonic head induction in Xenopus where LRP6 promotes the posteriorizing role of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Thus, DKKs inhibit Wnt co-receptor function, exemplifying the modulation of LRP signalling by antagonists.",,
11029007,LDL-receptor-related proteins in Wnt signal transduction.,"The Wnt family of secreted signalling molecules are essential in embryo development and tumour formation. The Frizzled (Fz) family of serpentine receptors function as Wnt receptors, but how Fz proteins transduce signalling is not understood.

Here we report that LRP6 functions as a co-receptor for Wnt signal transduction. In Xenopus embryos, LRP6 activated Wnt-Fz signalling, and induced Wnt responsive genes, dorsal axis duplication and neural crest formation. An LRP6 mutant lacking the carboxyl intracellular domain blocked signalling by Wnt or Wnt-Fz, but not by Dishevelled or beta-catenin, and inhibited neural crest development. The extracellular domain of LRP6 bound Wnt-1 and associated with Fz in a Wnt-dependent manner. Our results indicate that LRP6 may be a component of the Wnt receptor complex.",Nature,2000
29233536,LEAP2 Is an Endogenous Antagonist of the Ghrelin Receptor.,"Ghrelin, an appetite-stimulatory hormone secreted by the stomach, was discovered as a ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). Through GHSR, ghrelin stimulates growth hormone (GH) secretion, a function that evolved to protect against starvation-induced hypoglycemia. Though the biology mediated by ghrelin has been described in great detail, regulation of ghrelin action is poorly understood. Here, we report the discovery of liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) as an endogenous antagonist of GHSR. LEAP2 is produced in the liver and small intestine, and its secretion is suppressed by fasting. LEAP2 fully inhibits GHSR activation by ghrelin and blocks the major effects of ghrelin in vivo, including food intake, GH release, and maintenance of viable glucose levels during chronic caloric restriction. In contrast, neutralizing antibodies that block endogenous LEAP2 function enhance ghrelin action in vivo.

10910894,LEC induces chemotaxis and adhesion by interacting with CCR1 and CCR8.,"Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC) is an unusually large CC chemokine, which is also known as LMC, HCC-4, NCC-4, and CCL16. Previously, LEC was shown to induce leukocyte migration but the responsible signaling receptors were not characterized. We report chemotaxis and competitive binding studies that show LEC binds to and activates CCR1 and CCR8 transfected HEK-293 cells. LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L. The molar concentration of LEC required to induce maximum cell migration is 20- to 200-fold greater than that required for RANTES or I309, respectively. All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination. This study suggests that LEC may be a more effective inducer of cell adhesion than cell migration.",Blood,2000

We recently demonstrated that CRP increased vascular permeability through direct binding to LOX-1. Here we examined, using a hypertensive rat model, whether LOX-1 is involved in CRP-induced complement activation.",Clinical chemistry,2011
9245480,LERK-7: a ligand of the Eph-related kinases is developmentally regulated in the brain.,"The eph family is the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Members of this subfamily display specific expression in the developing and adult brain. Recently, cDNAs encoding membrane bound ligands for these receptors have been identified which we have termed LERKs (ligand for eph-related kinases). We report here the isolation of LERK-7 from a human fetal brain cDNA library. LERK-7 encodes a protein of 228 amino acids and is anchored to the membrane by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. When transfected into CV1/EBNA cells, LERK-7 binds soluble forms of both hek and elk. In addition, a soluble form of LERK-7 will induce phosphorylation of eck expressed in a human duodenum adenocarcinoma cell line. LERK-7 expressed multiple transcripts (7.5-kb, 6.0-kb, and 3.5-kb) with the highest levels in human adult brain, heart, spleen, and ovary and human fetal brain, lung, and kidney. Similar to the other ligands in this family, LERK-7 is developmentally regulated in the brain. LERK-7 is identical to the recently described AL-1.",,
14508119,"Letal, A tumor-associated NKG2D immunoreceptor ligand, induces activation and expansion of effector immune cells.","NKG2D serves as one of the most potent activating receptors for effector lymphocytes. in peripheral tissues. Here we report the characterization of Letal, the first human trans-membrane NKG2D ligand lacking an immunoglobulin-like alpha-3 ectodomain. Letal is constitutively expressed by a variety of normal tissues, and is upregulated in tumor cells of different origins. Unlike other NKG2D ligands, Letal mRNA expression progressively decreased after treatment of tumor cells with retinoic acid. Simultaneous T-cell receptor activation and engagement of Letal stimulated proliferation of CD8(+) cells and dramatically increased IL-2 and IFNgamma secretion. In addition, Letal induced the killing of cancer cells by CD8(+) and NK cells. These results suggest that Letal delivers activating signals to NK cells and promotes tumor immune surveillance by inducing the expansion of anti-tumor cytotoxic lymphocytes.",,
18760330,Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 3 associates with syntaxin 1.,"Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 3 (LGI3) is a member of LGI/epitempin (EPTP) family. The biological function of LGI3 and its association with disease are not known. We previously reported that mouse LGI3 was highly expressed in brain in a developmentally and transcriptionally regulated manner. In this study, we identified syntaxin 1, a SNARE component in exocytosis, as a candidate functional target of LGI3. Western blot analysis of mouse brain extract with LGI3 antibodies detected multiple protein forms (75-, 60-, 35- and 25-kDa). Proteomic analysis, pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments identified syntaxin 1 as an LGI3-associated protein. LGI3 colocalized with syntaxin 1 in processes of cortical neurons with punctate synaptic pattern and was enriched in synaptosomal fraction. Coimmunoprecipitation showed that LGI3-syntaxin 1 complex did not contain other SNARE components, SNAP25 and VAMP2. Recombinant LGI3 attenuated Ca(2+)-evoked glutamate release from digitonin-permeabilized synaptosomes and transfection of PC12 cells with LGI3 decreased K(+)-induced secretion of human growth hormone. Thus, LGI3 may play a regulatory role in neuronal exocytosis via its interaction with syntaxin 1.",,
22405860,Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 3 regulates adipogenesis through ADAM23.,"Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 3 (LGI3) is a secreted protein and a member of LGI/epitempin family. We previously showed that LGI3 was highly expressed in brain and played regulatory roles in neuronal exocytosis and differentiation. Besides the nervous system, LGI3 was shown to be expressed in diverse tissues. In this study, we found that LGI3 and its receptor candidate ADAM23 were expressed in adipose tissues and 3T3-L1 cells. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes secreted a 60-kDa protein, a major secreted form of LGI3, which declined with adipocyte differentiation. LGI3 was also expressed in adipose tissue macrophages in the ob/ob mice and in macrophage cell line. The 60-kDa LGI3 protein was selectively increased in the ob/ob adipose tissues comparing with the lean mice. Pull-down experiments, coimmunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry indicated that LGI3 associated with ADAM23 in adipose tissues and 3T3-L1 cells. Knockdown of LGI3 or ADAM23 by siRNA increased adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Treatment with LGI3 protein did not affect preadipocyte proliferation but attenuated adipogenesis and this effect was reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ADAM23. Taken together, we propose that LGI3 may be a candidate adipokine that is perturbed in obesity and suppresses adipogenesis through its receptor, ADAM23.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,2012
12707269,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1, and oncostatin M share structural binding determinants in the immunoglobulin-like domain of LIF receptor.","Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), and oncostatin M (OSM) are four helix bundle cytokines acting through a common heterodimeric receptor composed of gp130 and LIF receptor (LIFR). Binding to LIFR occurs through a binding site characterized by an FXXK motif located at the N terminus of helix D (site III). The immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of LIFR was modeled, and the physico-chemical properties of its Connolly surface were analyzed. This analysis revealed an area displaying properties complementary to those of the LIF site III. Two residues of the Ig-like domain of LIFR, Asp214 and Phe284, formed a mirror image of the FXXK motif. Engineered LIFR mutants in which either or both of these two residues were mutated to alanine were transfected in Ba/F3 cells already containing gp130. The F284A mutation impaired the biological response induced by LIF and CT-1, whereas the response to OSM remained unchanged. The Asp214 mutation did not alter the functional responses. The D214A/F284A double mutation, however, totally impaired cellular proliferation to LIF and CT-1 and partially impaired OSM-induced proliferation with a 20-fold increase in EC50. These results were corroborated by the analysis of STAT3 phosphorylation and Scatchard analysis of cytokine binding to Ba/F3 cells. Molecular modeling of the complex of LIF with the Ig-like domain of LIFR provides a clue for the superadditivity of the D214A/F284A double mutation. Our results indicate that LIF, CT-1, and OSM share an overlapping binding site located in the Ig-like domain of LIFR. The different behaviors of LIF and CT-1, on one side, and of OSM, on the other side, can be related to the different affinity of their site III for LIFR.",,
12560218,Leukocyte antiadhesive actions of annexin 1: ALXR- and FPR-related anti-inflammatory mechanisms.,"Recent investigations conducted with human neutrophils have indicated an involvement for the receptor for formylated peptides, termed FPR, and its analog FPRL1 (or ALXR because it is the receptor for the endogenous ligand lipoxin A(4)) in the in vitro inhibitory actions of the glucocorticoid-regulated protein annexin 1 and its peptidomimetics. To translate these findings in in vivo settings, we have used an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) procedure to promote leukocyte-endothelium interactions in the mouse mesenteric microcirculation. In naive mice, the annexin 1 mimetic peptide Ac2-26 (20 to 100 microg administered intravenously prior to reperfusion) abolished I/R-induced cell adhesion and emigration, but not cell rolling. In FPR-deficient mice, peptide Ac2-26 retained significant inhibitory actions (about 50% of the effects in naive mice), and these were blocked by an FPR antagonist, termed butyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe, or Boc2. In vitro, neutrophils taken from these animals could be activated at high concentrations of formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (30 microM; fMLP), and this effect was blocked by cell incubation with peptide Ac2-26 (66 microM) or Boc2 (100 microM). FPR-deficient neutrophils expressed ALXR mRNA and protein. Both ALXR agonists, lipoxin A(4) and peptide Ac2-26, provoked detachment of adherent leukocytes in naive as well as in FPR-deficient mice, whereas the CXC chemokine KC or fMLP were inactive. The present findings demonstrate that endogenous regulatory autocoids such as lipoxin A(4) and annexin 1-derived peptides function to disengage adherent cells during cell-cell interactions.",,
24585933,Leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1 is a novel inhibitory receptor for surfactant protein D.,"The collagenous C-type lectin, SP-D, is a multitrimeric glycoprotein present at mucosal surfaces and is involved in host defense against infections in mammals. SP-D has immunomodulatory properties, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. SP-D contains collagen domains. LAIR-1 is an inhibitory immune receptor at the cell surface of various immune-competent cells that binds collagen. We hypothesized that the immunomodulatory functions of SP-D can be mediated via interactions between its collagen domain and LAIR-1. Binding assays show that SP-D interacts via its collagenous domain with LAIR-1 and the related LAIR-2. This does not affect the mannan-binding capacities of SP-D, which induces cross-linking of LAIR-1 in a cellular reporter assay. Functional assays show that SP-D inhibits the production of FcαR-mediated reactive oxygen via LAIR-1. Our studies indicate that SP-D is a functional ligand of the immune inhibitory receptor LAIR-1. Thus, we have identified a novel pathway for the immunomodulatory functions of SP-D mediated via binding of its collagenous domains to LAIR-1. This may provide a mechanism for the unexplained immunomodulatory function of the collagenous domains of SP-D.",,
18974846,"LGI1 and LGI4 bind to ADAM22, ADAM23 and ADAM11.","The transmembrane protein ADAM22 is expressed at high levels in the brain. From its molecular structure, ADAM22 is thought to be an adhesion molecule or a receptor because it has functional disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich sequences in its ectodomain. The phenotypic analysis of ADAM22-deficient mice has indicated the important roles played by ADAM22 in proper neuronal function and peripheral nerve development, however, the precise molecular function of ADAM22 is still unknown. To understand the function of ADAM22 on a molecular basis, we identified ADAM22 binding proteins by using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis. This analysis revealed that Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) is the most potent ADAM22 binding protein in mouse brain. By our quantitative cell-ELISA system, we demonstrated the specific binding of LGI1 with ADAM22. Furthermore, we showed that LGI4, a putative ADAM22 ligand, also bound to ADAM22. Characterization of the binding specificity of LGI1 and LGI4 suggested that ADAM22 is not a sole receptor, because ADAM11 and ADAM23 had a significant binding ability to LGI1 or LGI4. Therefore, LGI-ADAM system seems to be regulated not only by the affinity but also by the cell-type-specific expression of each protein. Our findings provide new clues to understand the functions of LGI1 and LGI4 as an ADAMs ligand.",,
20463223,LGI1 is a Nogo receptor 1 ligand that antagonizes myelin-based growth inhibition.,"Mutations in leucine-rich glioma inactivated (LGI1) are a genetic cause of autosomal dominant temporal lobe epilepsy with auditory features. LGI1 is a secreted protein that shares homology with members of the SLIT family, ligands that direct axonal repulsion and growth cone collapse, and we therefore considered the possibility that LGI1 may regulate neuronal process extension or growth cone collapse. Here we report that LGI1 does not affect growth directly but instead enhances neuronal growth on myelin-based inhibitory substrates and antagonizes myelin-induced growth cone collapse. We show that LGI1 mediates this effect by functioning as a specific Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1) ligand that antagonizes the action of myelin-based inhibitory cues. Finally, we demonstrate that NgR1 and ADAM22 physically associate to form a receptor complex in which NgR1 facilitates LGI1 binding to ADAM22.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2010
21829378,LGI2 truncation causes a remitting focal epilepsy in dogs.,"One quadrillion synapses are laid in the first two years of postnatal construction of the human brain, which are then pruned until age 10 to 500 trillion synapses composing the final network. Genetic epilepsies are the most common neurological diseases with onset during pruning, affecting 0.5% of 2-10-year-old children, and these epilepsies are often characterized by spontaneous remission. We previously described a remitting epilepsy in the Lagotto romagnolo canine breed. Here, we identify the gene defect and affected neurochemical pathway. We reconstructed a large Lagotto pedigree of around 34 affected animals. Using genome-wide association in 11 discordant sib-pairs from this pedigree, we mapped the disease locus to a 1.7 Mb region of homozygosity in chromosome 3 where we identified a protein-truncating mutation in the Lgi2 gene, a homologue of the human epilepsy gene LGI1. We show that LGI2, like LGI1, is neuronally secreted and acts on metalloproteinase-lacking members of the ADAM family of neuronal receptors, which function in synapse remodeling, and that LGI2 truncation, like LGI1 truncations, prevents secretion and ADAM interaction. The resulting epilepsy onsets at around seven weeks (equivalent to human two years), and remits by four months (human eight years), versus onset after age eight in the majority of human patients with LGI1 mutations. Finally, we show that Lgi2 is expressed highly in the immediate post-natal period until halfway through pruning, unlike Lgi1, which is expressed in the latter part of pruning and beyond. LGI2 acts at least in part through the same ADAM receptors as LGI1, but earlier, ensuring electrical stability (absence of epilepsy) during pruning years, preceding this same function performed by LGI1 in later years. LGI2 should be considered a candidate gene for common remitting childhood epilepsies, and LGI2-to-LGI1 transition for mechanisms of childhood epilepsy remission.",PLoS genetics,2011
20461023,LGI3 interacts with flotillin-1 to mediate APP trafficking and exosome formation.,"We recently showed that leucine-rich glioma inactivated 3 (LGI3) mediates the internalization of beta-amyloid protein and transferrin, a well-known marker for clathrin-dependent endocytosis, in neural cells. These findings strongly suggest that LGI3 is involved in the endocytosis system in the brain; however, the precise function of LGI3 remains unclear. Here, we show that LGI3 interacts with flotillin-1 (Flo1), and RNA interference analysis shows that LGI3 stabilized Flo1, and Flo1 also stabilized LGI3 vice versa. Moreover, the downregulation of the LGI3/Flo1 complex altered beta-amyloid precursor protein trafficking directly to late endosomes and disrupted exosome formation, suggesting that LGI3 is involved not only in endocytosis but also in another intracellular transport system through binding with its co-factor such as Flo1.",Neuroreport,2010
21909076,LGR4 and LGR5 are R-spondin receptors mediating Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/PCP signalling.,"R-spondins are secreted Wnt signalling agonists, which regulate embryonic patterning and stem cell proliferation, but whose mechanism of action is poorly understood. Here we show that R-spondins bind to the orphan G-protein-coupled receptors LGR4 and LGR5 by their Furin domains. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mammalian cells and Xenopus embryos indicate that LGR4 and LGR5 promote R-spondin-mediated Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/PCP signalling. R-spondin-triggered β-catenin signalling requires Clathrin, while Wnt3a-mediated β-catenin signalling requires Caveolin-mediated endocytosis, suggesting that internalization has a mechanistic role in R-spondin signalling.",EMBO reports,2011
21727895,Lgr5 homologues associate with Wnt receptors and mediate R-spondin signalling.,"The adult stem cell marker Lgr5 and its relative Lgr4 are often co-expressed in Wnt-driven proliferative compartments. We find that conditional deletion of both genes in the mouse gut impairs Wnt target gene expression and results in the rapid demise of intestinal crypts, thus phenocopying Wnt pathway inhibition. Mass spectrometry demonstrates that Lgr4 and Lgr5 associate with the Frizzled/Lrp Wnt receptor complex. Each of the four R-spondins, secreted Wnt pathway agonists, can bind to Lgr4, -5 and -6. In HEK293 cells, RSPO1 enhances canonical WNT signals initiated by WNT3A. Removal of LGR4 does not affect WNT3A signalling, but abrogates the RSPO1-mediated signal enhancement, a phenomenon rescued by re-expression of LGR4, -5 or -6. Genetic deletion of Lgr4/5 in mouse intestinal crypt cultures phenocopies withdrawal of Rspo1 and can be rescued by Wnt pathway activation. Lgr5 homologues are facultative Wnt receptor components that mediate Wnt signal enhancement by soluble R-spondin proteins. These results will guide future studies towards the application of R-spondins for regenerative purposes of tissues expressing Lgr5 homologues.",Nature,2011
10628755,Ligand activation domain of human orphan growth hormone (GH) secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) conserved from Pufferfish to humans.,"Synthetic ligands have been identified that reset and amplify the cycle of pulsatile GH secretion by interacting with the orphan GH-secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). The GHS-R is rhodopsin like, but does not obviously belong to any of the established G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) subfamilies. We recently characterized the closely related orphan family member, GPR38, as the motilin receptor. A common property of both receptors is that they amplify and sustain pulsatile biological responses in the continued presence of their respective ligands. To efficiently identify additional members of this new GPCR family, we explored a vertebrate species having a compact genome, that was evolutionary distant from human, but where functionally important genes were likely to be conserved. Accordingly, three distinct full-length clones, encoding proteins of significant identity to the human GHS-R, were isolated from the Pufferfish (Spheroides nephelus). Southern analyses showed that the three cloned Pufferfish genes are highly conserved across species. The gene with closest identity (58%) was activated by three synthetic ligands that were chosen for their very high selectivity on the GHS-R as illustrated by their specificity in activating the wild-type human GHS-R but not the E124Q mutant. These results indicate that the ligand activation domain of the GHS-R has been evolutionary conserved from Pufferfish to human (400 million years), supporting the notion that the GHS-R and its natural ligand play a fundamentally important role in biology. Furthermore, they illustrate the power of exploiting the compact Pufferfish genome for simplifying the isolation of endocrinologically important receptor families.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",2000
11501527,Ligand binding regions in the receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator.,"The interaction between urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its cellular receptor (uPAR) is a key event in cell surface-associated plasminogen activation, relevant for cell migration and invasion. In order to define receptor recognition sites for uPA, we have expressed uPAR fragments as fusion products with the minor coat protein on the surface of M13 bacteriophages. Sequence analysis of cDNA fragments encoding uPA-binding peptides indicated the existence of a composite uPA-binding structure including all three uPAR domains. This finding was confirmed by experiments using an overlapping 15-mer peptide array covering the entire uPAR molecule. Four regions within the uPAR sequence were found to directly bind to uPA: two distinct regions containing amino acids 13--20 and amino acids 74--84 of the uPAR domain I, and regions in the putative loop 3 of the domains II and III. All the uPA-binding fragments from the three domains were shown to have an agonistic effect on uPA binding to immobilized uPAR. Furthermore, uPAR-(154--176) increased uPAR-transfected BAF3-cell adhesion on vitronectin in the presence of uPA, whereas uPAR-(247--276) stimulated the cell adhesion both in the absence or presence of uPA. The latter fragment was also able to augment the binding of vitronectin to uPAR in a purified system, thereby mimicking the effect of uPA on this interaction. These results indicate that uPA binding can take place to particular part(s) on several uPAR molecules and that direct uPAR-uPAR contacts may contribute to receptor activation and ligand binding.",,
9195962,Ligand for EPH-related kinase (LERK) 7 is the preferred high affinity ligand for the HEK receptor.,"HEK is a member of the EPH-like receptor tyrosine kinase family, which appear to have roles in development and oncogenesis. Recently, we purified a soluble HEK ligand which is also a ligand (AL1) for the HEK-related receptor EHK1. Promiscuity appears to be a characteristic feature of interactions between the EPH-like receptors and their ligands, termed ligands for EPH-related kinases (LERKs). This prompted us to analyze the interactions between the HEK exodomain and fusion proteins comprising candidate LERKs and the Fc portion of human IgG1 (Fc) or a FLAGTM-peptide tag by surface plasmon resonance, size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography, sedimentation equilibrium, and transphosphorylation. Our results indicate that AL1/LERK7 is the preferred high-affinity ligand for HEK, forming a stable 1:1 complex with a dissociation constant of 12 nM. As expected the apparent affinities of bivalent fusion proteins of LERKs and the Fc portion of human IgG1 had significantly reduced dissociation rates compared with their monovalent, FLAGTM-tagged derivatives. High-avidity binding of monovalent ligands can be achieved by antibody-mediated cross-linking of monovalent ligands and with LERK7 results in specific phosphorylation of the receptor. By extrapolation, our findings indicate that some of the reported LERK-receptor interactions are a consequence of the use of bivalent ligand or receptor constructs and may be functionally irrelevant.",,
9763524,"Ligand specificity of LOX-1, a novel endothelial receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein.","Endothelial dysfunction, or activation, elicited by oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) and its lipid constituents has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We recently have identified a novel receptor for Ox-LDL-designated lectin-like Ox-LDL receptor (LOX-1) in vascular endothelial cells. To examine ligand specificity of LOX-1, we established CHO cell lines stably expressing both human and bovine LOX-1 (LOX-1-CHO). LOX-1-CHO bound and degraded 125I-labeled Ox-LDL but did not significantly degrade 125I-labeled acetylated LDL (Ac-LDL). Fucoidin and maleylated BSA (M-BSA), which inhibit 125I-Ox-LDL binding to class A scavenger receptors, did not inhibit 125I-Ox-LDL binding or degradation in LOX-1-CHO. Polyinosinic acid and carrageenan, in contrast, significantly reduced 125I-Ox-LDL binding to LOX-1-CHO by 62% and 60%, respectively. Delipidated and untreated 125I-Ox-LDL were bound and degraded equally in LOX-1-CHO; furthermore, excess amounts of unlabeled, delipidated Ox-LDL inhibited binding and degradation of untreated 125I-Ox-LDL. Taken together, LOX-1 is a receptor for Ox-LDL but not for Ac-LDL. LOX-1 recognizes protein moiety of Ox-LDL, and its ligand specificity is distinct from other receptors for Ox-LDL, including class A and B scavenger receptors.",,
11785979,Ligand-dependent activation of the melanocortin 5 receptor: cAMP production and ryanodine receptor-dependent elevations of [Ca(2+)](I).,"The melanocortins are involved in the regulation of various cognitive and physiological processes such as learning, feeding, immune suppression, pigmentation, and sebum production. Five melanocortin receptors have been identified, of which the melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R) has the most widespread distribution. This subtype is found in the brain, and at numerous peripheral sites including the skin where it is expressed in the sebaceous glands. The purpose of this study was to identify the peptide that functions as a natural ligand at the MC5R in the skin. alpha-MSH, ACTH1-39, ACTH1-17, ACTH1-10, and ACTH4-10 all increased the production of cAMP in HEK293 cells transfected with the mouse MC5R. alpha-MSH and ACTH1-17 were the most potent in this respect. In addition, all peptides stimulated a rapid and transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i), and, ACTH1-10 was the most potent. The increases in [Ca(2+)](i) were of intracellular origin, but not associated with inositol phosphate production. The elevations in [Ca(2+)](i) were reduced by ruthenium red and procaine and it is therefore possible that they were mediated via ryanodine receptors.",,

Of the three VEGF receptors (VEGFR), VEGFR-1 and -2 are expressed on blood vessels; VEGFR-2 is found also on lymphatic vessels. VEGFR-3 is expressed mainly on lymphatic vessels but it is also up-regulated in tumor angiogenesis. Although VEGFR-3 is essential for proper lymphatic development, its signal transduction mechanisms are still incompletely understood. Trans-phosphorylation of activated, dimerized receptor tyrosine kinases is known to be critical for the regulation of kinase activity and for receptor interaction with signal transduction molecules. In this study, we have identified five tyrosyl phosphorylation sites in the VEGFR-3 carboxyl-terminal tail. These sites were used both in VEGFR-3 overexpressed in 293 cells and when the endogenous VEGFR-3 was activated in lymphatic endothelial cells. Interestingly, VEGF-C stimulation of lymphatic endothelial cells also induced the formation of VEGFR-3/VEGFR-2 heterodimers, in which VEGFR-3 was phosphorylated only at three of the five sites while the two most carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues appeared not to be accessible for the VEGFR-2 kinase. Our data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal tail of VEGFR-3 provides important regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation sites with potential signal transduction capacity and that these sites are differentially used in ligand-induced homo- and heterodimeric receptor complexes.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003

The functional, soluble fragment of TALL-1 (sTALL-1) forms a virus-like assembly for its proper function. Here we determine the crystal structures of sTALL-1 complexed with the extracellular domains of BCMA and BAFF-R at 2.6 and 2.5 A, respectively. The single cysteine-rich domain of BCMA and BAFF-R both have saddle-like architectures, which sit on the horseback-like surface formed by four coil regions on each individual sTALL-1 monomer. Three novel structural modules, D2, X2 and N, were revealed from the current structures. Sequence alignments, structural modelling and mutagenesis revealed that one disulphide bridge in BAFF-R is critical for determining the binding specificity of the extracellular domain eBAFF-R to TALL-1 instead of APRIL, a closely related ligand of TALL-1, which was confirmed by binding experiments in vitro.",,
29180449,Ligand-specific conformational transitions and intracellular transport are required for atypical chemokine receptor 3-mediated chemokine scavenging.,"The atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3 contributes to chemotaxis by binding, internalizing, and degrading the chemokines CXCL11 and CXCL12 to shape and terminate chemotactic gradients during development and immune responses. Although unable to trigger G protein activation, both ligands activate G protein-independent ACKR3 responses and prompt arrestin recruitment. This offers a model to specifically study ligand-specific receptor conformations leading to G protein-independent signaling and to functional parameters such as receptor transport and chemokine degradation. We here show chemokine specificity in arrestin recruitment, by different effects of single amino acid substitutions in ACKR3 on arrestin in response to CXCL12 or CXCL11. Chemokine specificity in receptor transport was also observed, as CXCL11 induced faster receptor internalization, slower recycling, and longer intracellular sojourn of ACKR3 than CXCL12.

Fibrinogen binding requires agonist activation of platelets, whereas the binding of short synthetic RGD peptides does not. We now find that RGD peptide binding leads to changes in alpha IIb beta 3 that are associated with acquisition of high affinity fibrinogen-binding function (activation) and subsequent platelet aggregation. The structural specificities for peptide activation and for inhibition of ligand binding are similar, indicating that both are consequences of occupancy of the same site(s) on alpha IIb beta 3. Thus, the RGD sequence is a trigger of high affinity ligand binding to alpha IIb beta 3, and certain RGD-mimetics are partial agonists as well as competitive antagonists of integrin function.",,
7973638,Ligands for EPH-related receptor tyrosine kinases that require membrane attachment or clustering for activity.,"The EPH-related transmembrane tyrosine kinases constitute the largest known family of receptor-like tyrosine kinases, with many members displaying specific patterns of expression in the developing and adult nervous system. A family of cell surface-bound ligands exhibiting distinct, but overlapping, specificities for these EPH-related kinases was identified. These ligands were unable to act as conventional soluble factors. However, they did function when presented in membrane-bound form, suggesting that they require direct cell-to-cell contact to activate their receptors. Membrane attachment may serve to facilitate ligand dimerization or aggregation, because antibody-mediated clustering activated previously inactive soluble forms of these ligands.",,
9168114,Ligands for ErbB-family receptors encoded by a neuregulin-like gene.,"Neuregulins (also called ARIA, GGF, heregulin or NDF) are a group of polypeptide factors that arise from alternative RNA splicing of a single gene. Through their interaction with the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), neuregulins help to regulate cell growth and differentiation in many tissues. Here we report the cloning of a second neuregulin-like gene, neuregulin-2. The encoded product of the neuregulin-2 gene has a motif structure similar to that of neuregulins and an alternative splicing site in the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-like domain gives rise to two isoforms (alpha and beta). Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of adult rat tissues indicate that expression of neuregulin-2 is highest in the cerebellum, and the expression pattern is different from that of neuregulins. Recombinant neuregulin-2beta induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 in cell lines expressing all of these ErbB-family receptors. However, in cell lines with defined combinations of ErbBs, neuregulin-2beta only activates those with ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, suggesting that signalling by neuregulin-2 is mediated by ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 receptors.",,
9462508,"LIGHT, a new member of the TNF superfamily, and lymphotoxin alpha are ligands for herpesvirus entry mediator.","Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 infect activated T lymphocytes by attachment of the HSV envelope glycoprotein D (gD) to the cellular herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), an orphan member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Here, we demonstrate that HVEM binds two cellular ligands, secreted lymphotoxin alpha (LTalpha) and LIGHT, a new member of the TNF superfamily. LIGHT is a 29 kDa type II transmembrane protein produced by activated T cells that also engages the receptor for the LTalphabeta heterotrimer but does not form complexes with either LTalpha or LTbeta. HSV1 gD inhibits the interaction of HVEM with LIGHT, and LIGHT and gD interfere with HVEM-dependent cell entry by HSV1. This characterizes herpesvirus gD as a membrane-bound viokine and establishes LIGHT-HVEM as integral components of the lymphotoxin cytokine-receptor system.",,

14966521,LINGO-1 is a component of the Nogo-66 receptor/p75 signaling complex.,"Axon regeneration in the adult CNS is prevented by inhibitors in myelin. These inhibitors seem to modulate RhoA activity by binding to a receptor complex comprising a ligand-binding subunit (the Nogo-66 receptor NgR1) and a signal transducing subunit (the neurotrophin receptor p75). However, in reconstituted non-neuronal systems, NgR1 and p75 together are unable to activate RhoA, suggesting that additional components of the receptor may exist. Here we describe LINGO-1, a nervous system-specific transmembrane protein that binds NgR1 and p75 and that is an additional functional component of the NgR1/p75 signaling complex. In non-neuronal cells, coexpression of human NgR1, p75 and LINGO-1 conferred responsiveness to oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein, as measured by RhoA activation. A dominant-negative human LINGO-1 construct attenuated myelin inhibition in transfected primary neuronal cultures. This effect on neurons was mimicked using an exogenously added human LINGO-1-Fc fusion protein. Together these observations suggest that LINGO-1 has an important role in CNS biology.",,
12138091,Lipid free apolipoprotein E binds to the class B Type I scavenger receptor I (SR-BI) and enhances cholesteryl ester uptake from lipoproteins.,"The Class B type I scavenger receptor I (SR-BI) is a physiologically relevant high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor that can mediate selective cholesteryl ester (CE) uptake by cells. Direct interaction of apolipoprotein E (apoE) with this receptor has never been demonstrated, and its implication in CE uptake is still controversial. By using a human adrenal cell line (NCI-H295R), we have addressed the role of apoE in binding to SR-BI and in selective CE uptake from lipoproteins to cells. This cell line does not secrete apoE and SR-BI is its major HDL-binding protein. We can now provide evidence that 1) free apoE is a ligand for SR-BI, 2) apoE associated to lipids or in lipoproteins does not modulate binding or CE-selective uptake by the SR-BI pathway, and 3) the direct interaction of free apoE to SR-BI leads to an increase in CE uptake from lipoproteins of both low and high densities. We propose that this direct interaction could modify SR-BI structure in cell membranes and potentiate CE uptake.",,
12165521,"Lipid microdomains are required sites for the selective endocytosis and nuclear translocation of IFN-gamma, its receptor chain IFN-gamma receptor-1, and the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1alpha.","IFN-gamma contains a nuclear localization sequence that may play a role in the nuclear transport of activated STAT1alpha via a complex of IFN-gamma/IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR)-1/STAT1alpha with the nuclear importer nucleoprotein interactor 1. In this study, we examine the mechanism of endocytosis of IFNGR-1 and the relationship of its nuclear translocation to that of STAT1alpha. In untreated WISH cells, both IFNGR-1 and IFNGR-2 were constitutively localized within caveolae-like microdomains isolated from plasma membrane. However, treatment of cells with IFN-gamma resulted in rapid migration of IFNGR-1, but not IFNGR-2, from these microdomains. Filipin pretreatment, which specifically inhibits endocytosis from caveolae-like microdomains, inhibited the nuclear translocation of IFN-gamma and IFNGR-1 as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1alpha, but did not affect the binding of IFN-gamma to these cells. In the Jurkat T lymphocyte cell line, which does not express caveolin-1, nuclear translocation of IFNGR-1 and STAT1alpha were similarly inhibited by filipin pretreatment. Isolation of lipid microdomains from Jurkat cells showed that both IFNGR-1 and IFNGR-2 were associated with lipid microdomains only after stimulation with IFN-gamma, suggesting that the IFNGR subunits are recruited to lipid microdomains by IFN-gamma binding in lymphocytes (Jurkat) in contrast to their constitutive presence in epithelial (WISH) cells. In contrast, treatments that block clathrin-dependent endocytosis did not inhibit either activation or nuclear translocation of STAT1alpha or the nuclear translocation of IFN-gamma or IFNGR-1. Thus, membrane lipid microdomains play an important role in IFN-gamma-initiated endocytic events involving IFNGR-1, and the nuclear translocation of IFN-gamma, IFNGR-1, and STAT1alpha.",,
15265943,Liver-expressed chemokine/CC chemokine ligand 16 attracts eosinophils by interacting with histamine H4 receptor.,"Liver-expressed chemokine (LEC)/CCL16 is a human CC chemokine that is constitutively expressed by the liver parenchymal cells and present in the normal plasma at high concentrations. Previous studies have shown that CCL16 is a low-affinity ligand for CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, and CCR8 and attracts monocytes and T cells. Recently, a novel histamine receptor termed type 4 (H4) has been identified and shown to be selectively expressed by eosinophils and mast cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CCL16 induced pertussis toxin-sensitive calcium mobilization and chemotaxis in murine L1.2 cells expressing H4 but not those expressing histamine receptor type 1 (H1) or type 2 (H2). CCL16 bound to H4 with a K(d) of 17 nM. By RT-PCR, human and mouse eosinophils express H4 but not H3. Accordingly, CCL16 induced efficient migratory responses in human and mouse eosinophils. Furthermore, the responses of human and mouse eosinophils to CCL16 were effectively suppressed by thioperamide, an antagonist for H3 and H4. Intravenous injection of CCL16 into mice induced a rapid mobilization of eosinophils from bone marrow to peripheral blood, which was also suppressed by thioperamide. Collectively, CCL16 is a novel functional ligand for H4 and may have a role in trafficking of eosinophils.",,

LL-37 is the cleaved antimicrobial 37-residue, COOH-terminal peptide of hCAP18 (human cationic antimicrobial protein with a molecular size of 18 kD), the only identified member in humans of a family of proteins called cathelicidins. LL-37/hCAP18 is produced by neutrophils and various epithelial cells. Here we report that LL-37 is chemotactic for, and can induce Ca(2+) mobilization in, human monocytes and formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1)-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. LL-37-induced Ca(2+) mobilization in monocytes can also be cross-desensitized by an FPRL1-specific agonist. Furthermore, LL-37 is also chemotactic for human neutrophils and T lymphocytes that are known to express FPRL1. Our results suggest that, in addition to its microbicidal activity, LL-37 may contribute to innate and adaptive immunity by recruiting neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells to sites of microbial invasion by interacting with FPRL1.",The Journal of experimental medicine,2000
7688313,Localization of beta 1-integrins in human cartilage and their role in chondrocyte adhesion to collagen and fibronectin.,"In the past, proteins have been described that may be involved in chondrocyte interactions with extracellular collagen, but little is known about the role of integrins in chondrocyte-collagen interactions. Here we report on the analysis of beta 1-integrin distribution in human fetal cartilage and on the expression of integrins on fetal chondrocytes, using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to integrin alpha- and beta-chains. We show the presence of alpha 2-, alpha 5-, alpha 6-, alpha v-, and beta 1-chains on freshly isolated chondrocytes by surface immunofluorescence in the fluorescence-activated cell sorter and by surface iodination followed by immunoprecipitation. Affinity chromatography of bovine chondrocyte membrane proteins on a collagen-Sepharose column followed by immunoprecipitation confirmed the presence of the collagen-binding alpha 2 beta 1-integrin on chondrocytes. Chondrocyte adhesion on native collagens I and II, on fibronectin, and on laminin was completely blocked by anti-beta 1; anti-alpha 2 reduced chondrocyte binding to collagen by only 40-50%; similarly, anti-alpha 1-antibodies were also able to reduce chondrocyte binding to collagen, although alpha 1 could not be unequivocally identified on chondrocytes. Chondrocyte adhesion to fibronectin was Mg(2+)- and Ca(2+)-dependent and could be inhibited by anti-alpha 5 and by RGD peptides. Chondrocyte adhesion to native collagens is Mg(2+)-, but not Ca(2+)-dependent and RGD-independent. Interestingly, although these data point to a role of alpha 2 beta 1 in chondrocyte-collagen interactions in vitro, alpha 2 could not be visualized in sections of human fetal cartilage, in contrast to the beta 1-, alpha v-, and alpha 5-chains which were present. This suggests that alpha 2 beta 1-integrin may be involved in the assembly of a pericellular collagen matrix in vitro, but may not be required for chondrocyte-collagen interactions in intact cartilage.",Experimental cell research,1993
9463481,Localization of leptin binding domain in the leptin receptor.,"The leptin receptor is a member of the class I cytokine receptor family and is involved in the control of appetite and body weight. The predicted amino acid sequence of the extracellular region of the cloned leptin receptor differs from that of many other cytokine receptors in that it contains two homologous segments representing potential ligand binding sites. After the analysis of various deletion and substitution mutants of the leptin receptor, we found that the first potential binding motif is not required for leptin binding and receptor activation, whereas modification of the second potential binding motif can lead to inactive receptor mutants. Further deletion analysis generated a minimal binding domain that retains high affinity leptin binding. The leptin binding domain thus has been localized to residues 323-640, which contain the second segment of cytokine receptor domain/fibronectin type 3 domain (residues 428-635). Coexpression of the active isoform of leptin receptor (OB-Rb) with an inactive mutant lacking high affinity leptin binding site led to suppression of the activity mediated by OB-Rb, suggesting that the leptin receptor may exist as a multimeric complex in the absence of leptin.",,
9178757,Localization of ligand-binding domains of human corticotropin-releasing factor receptor: a chimeric receptor approach.,"Two CRF receptors, CRFR1 and CRFR2, have recently been cloned and characterized. CRFR1 shares 70% sequence identity with CRFR2, yet has much higher affinity for rat/human CRF (r/hCRF) than CRFR2. As a first step toward understanding the interactions between rat/human CRF and its receptor, the regions that are involved in receptor-ligand binding and/or receptor activation were determined by using chimeric receptor constructs of the two human CRFR subtypes, CRFR1 and CRFR2, followed by generating point mutations of the receptor. The EC50 values in stimulation of intracellular cAMP of the chimeric and mutant receptors for the peptide ligand were determined using a cAMP-dependent reporter system. Three regions of the receptor were found to be important for optimal binding of r/hCRF and/or receptor activation. The first region was mapped to the junction of the third extracellular domain and the fifth transmembrane domain; substitution of three amino acids of CRFR1 in this region (Val266, Tyr267, and Thr268) by the corresponding CRFR2 amino acids (Asp266, Leu267, and Val268) increased the EC50 value by approximately 10-fold. The other two regions were localized to the second extracellular domain of the CRFR1 involving amino acids 175-178 and His189 residue. Substitutions in these two regions each increased the EC50 value for r/hCRF by approximately 7- to 8-fold only in the presence of the amino acid 266-268 mutation involving the first region, suggesting that their roles in peptide ligand binding might be secondary.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",1997
12603837,Localization of presenilin-nicastrin complexes and gamma-secretase activity to the trans-Golgi network.,"Abundant biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that presenilins are catalytic components of gamma-secretase, the protease responsible for generating the Alzheimer amyloid beta-protein. However, the differential localization of presenilins to early secretory compartments and gamma-secretase substrates to late secretory compartments and the plasma membrane (the ""spatial paradox"") argues against this view. We investigated this issue by studying the localization of nicastrin, another putative gamma-secretase component, and its association with presenilin-1 into proteolytically active complexes. Glycosidase digests revealed that nicastrin exists in multiple glycoforms and is terminally sialylated, a modification often associated with the trans-Golgi network. Trafficking of nicastrin to the trans-Golgi network was confirmed by density gradient fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy. In presenilin-deficient cells, however, nicastrin trafficking and maturation were abnormal, as the protein was restricted to early secretory compartments and failed to be sialylated. Mature sialylated nicastrin in trans-Golgi network fractions was complexed quantitatively with N- and C-terminal fragments of presenilin-1, whereas immature nicastrin present in early secretory compartments was not. Additionally, trans-Golgi network fractions contained the gamma-secretase substrate beta-amyloid precursor protein C83 and were enriched in presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase proteolytic activity. The results resolve the apparent spatial paradox by demonstrating that presenilin-nicastrin complexes and presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase activity are co-localized to a late secretory compartment. The findings provide further evidence that presenilin-containing complexes are the gamma-secretase, and indicate that presenilins also regulate gamma-secretase assembly.",,
7797478,Localization of the insulin-like growth factor II binding site to amino acids 1508-1566 in repeat 11 of the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor.,"The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGF-II receptor) binds insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) with high affinity. To localize the IGF-II binding site within the 15 repeating units that form the extracytoplasmic domain of the receptor, purified human M6P/IGF-II receptor was digested with thermolysin, and the fragments were analyzed for their ability to bind 125I-IGF-II in a cross-linking assay. Two IGF-II-binding receptor fragments of 23 and 37 kDa were purified. Sequence analysis revealed that the fragments consist of disulfide connected peptides comprising amino acids 1331-1566 and 1331-1697 of the receptor repeats 9-12. In a second approach we expressed truncated forms of the M6P/IGF-II receptor fused to the C terminus of the extracytoplasmic domain of the 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Fusion proteins containing M6P/IGF-II receptor repeats 10-15, 10-11, or 11-15 bound IGF-II, whereas a fusion protein containing the single repeat 10 failed to bind. This result indicates that repeat 11 (amino acids 1508-1650) is sufficient for binding of IGF-II. Residues 1508-1566, which are shared by the 23-kDa IGF-II-binding fragment and repeat 11, are proposed to form the IGF-II binding site of the M6P/IGF-II receptor.",,
14585398,Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a heparin-dependent adhesion receptor for connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in rat activated hepatic stellate cells.,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a cysteine-rich, extracellular matrix-associated heparin-binding protein implicated in a variety of fibrotic disorders. CTGF is initially synthesized as a mosaic protein containing four discrete structural modules (CTGF(1-4)) but this is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage yielding isoforms comprising modules 3 and 4 (CTGF(3-4)) or module 4 alone (CTGF(4)). In this study, we show that cultured rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) produce CTGF(1-4) and CTGF(3-4) following treatment with transforming growth factor-beta and that CTGF is a cell adhesion factor for activated HSCs. Low density lipoprotein receptor-associated protein (LRP) is a receptor for CTGF(1-4) or CTGF(3-4), but not CTGF(4), whereas cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are binding sites for all CTGF isoforms. Prior occupancy of LRP with other LRP ligands, receptor associated protein, anti-LRP, or a thrombospondin type I peptide (TEWSACSKTCG) resulted in a 50% decrease in the adhesion of activated HSCs to CTGF(1-4) or CTGF(3-4) whereas there was no effect on CTGF(4)-mediated adhesion. Co-incubation of CTGF with heparin or perturbation of cell surface HSPGs with heparinase or sodium chlorate completely blocked adhesion of activated HSCs to all CTGF isoforms. Freshly isolated HSCs demonstrated only weak binding to CTGF but strong binding to fibronectin. Thus HSC adhesion is at least partially promoted by CTGF through its binding to LRP, a process that is heparin-dependent. CTGF-LRP interactions are likely mediated by module 3 and CTGF-heparin interactions occur principally in module 4, although additional motifs may account for the heparin-dependency of LRP binding. These data show that LRP and HSPGs are utilized by HSCs for binding to CTGF and suggest that these cell surface molecules may be involved in mediating CTGF activity or adhesive signaling during the activation process.",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,2003
12522143,Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and factor IXa share structural requirements for binding to the A3 domain of coagulation factor VIII.,"Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is an endocytic receptor that binds multiple distinct ligands, including blood coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). FVIII is a heterodimeric multidomain protein that consists of a heavy chain (domains A1, a1, A2, a2, and B) and a light chain (domains a3, A3, C1, and C2). Both chains contribute to high-affinity interaction with LRP. One LRP-interactive region has previously been located in the C2 domain, but its affinity is low in comparison with that of the entire FVIII light chain. We now have compared a variety of FVIII light chain derivatives with the light chain of its homolog FVa for LRP binding. In surface plasmon resonance studies employing LRP cluster II, the FVa and FVIII light chains proved different in that only FVIII displayed high-affinity binding. Because the FVIII a3-A3-C1 fragment was effective in associating with LRP, this region was explored for structural elements that are exposed but not conserved in FV. Competition studies using synthetic peptides suggested that LRP binding involves the FVIII-specific region Lys(1804)-Ala(1834) in the A3 domain. In line with this observation, LRP binding was inhibited by a recombinant antibody fragment that specifically binds to the FVIII sequence Glu(1811)-Lys(1818). The role of this sequence in LRP binding was further tested using a FVIII/FV chimera in which sequence Glu(1811)-Lys(1818) was replaced with the corresponding sequence of FV. Although this chimera still displayed residual binding to LRP cluster II, its affinity was reduced. This suggests that multiple sites in FVIII contribute to high-affinity LRP binding, one of which is the FVIII A3 domain region Glu(1811)-Lys(1818). This suggests that LRP binding to the FVIII A3 domain involves the same structural elements that also contribute to the assembly of FVIII with FIXa.",,
1464627,"Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and gp330 bind similar ligands, including plasminogen activator-inhibitor complexes and lactoferrin, an inhibitor of chylomicron remnant clearance.","The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP) and gp330, two members of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family, share a multitude of cysteine-rich repeats. LRP has been shown to act as an endocytosis-mediating receptor for several ligands, including protease-antiprotease complexes and plasma lipoproteins. The former include alpha 2-macroglobulin-protease complexes and plasminogen activator inhibitor-activator complexes. The latter include chylomicron remnant-like particles designated beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) complexed with apoprotein E or lipoprotein lipase. The binding specificity of gp330 is unknown. In the current studies we show that gp330 from rat kidney membranes binds several of these ligands on nitrocellulose blots. We also show that both LRP and gp330 bind an additional ligand, bovine lactoferrin, which is known to inhibit the hepatic clearance of chylomicron remnants. Lactoferrin blocked the LRP-dependent stimulation of cholesteryl ester synthesis in cultured human fibroblasts elicited by apoprotein E-beta-VLDL or lipoprotein lipase-beta-VLDL complexes. Cross-competition experiments in fibroblasts showed that the multiple ligands recognize at least three distinct, but partially overlapping sites on the LRP molecule. Binding of all ligands to LRP and gp330 was inhibited by the 39-kDa protein, which co-purifies with the two receptors, suggesting that the 39-kDa protein is a universal regulator of ligand binding to both receptors. The correlation of the inhibitory effects of lactoferrin in vivo and in vitro support the notion that LRP functions as a chylomicron remnant receptor in liver. LRP and gp330 share a multiplicity of binding sites, and both may function as endocytosis-mediating receptors for a large number of ligands in different organs.",,
12821648,Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein is a calreticulin coreceptor that signals focal adhesion disassembly.,"Thrombospondin (TSP) signals focal adhesion disassembly (the intermediate adhesive state) through interactions with cell surface calreticulin (CRT). TSP or a peptide (hep I) of the active site induces focal adhesion disassembly through binding to CRT, which activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) through Galphai2 proteins. Because CRT is not a transmembrane protein, it is likely that CRT signals as part of a coreceptor complex. We now show that low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) mediates focal adhesion disassembly initiated by TSP binding to CRT. LRP antagonists (antibodies, receptor-associated protein) block hep I/TSP-induced focal adhesion disassembly. LRP is necessary for TSP/hep I signaling because TSP/hep I is unable to stimulate focal adhesion disassembly or ERK or PI3K signaling in fibroblasts deficient in LRP. LRP is important in TSP-CRT signaling, as shown by the ability of hep I to stimulate association of Galphai2 with LRP. The isolated proteins LRP and CRT interact, and LRP and CRT are associated with hep I in molecular complexes extracted from cells. These data establish a mechanism of cell surface CRT signaling through its coreceptor, LRP, and suggest a novel function for LRP in regulating cell adhesion.",The Journal of cell biology,2003
34581723,LPHN2 inhibits vascular permeability by differential control of endothelial cell adhesion.,"Dynamic modulation of endothelial cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion is essential for blood vessel patterning and functioning. Yet the molecular mechanisms involved in this process have not been completely deciphered. We identify the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (ADGR) Latrophilin 2 (LPHN2) as a novel determinant of endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and barrier function. In cultured ECs, endogenous LPHN2 localizes at ECM contacts, signals through cAMP/Rap1, and inhibits focal adhesion (FA) formation and nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ transcriptional regulators, while promoting tight junction (TJ) assembly. ECs also express an endogenous LPHN2 ligand, fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane 2 (FLRT2), that prevents ECM-elicited EC behaviors in an LPHN2-dependent manner. Vascular ECs of lphn2a knock-out zebrafish embryos become abnormally stretched, display a hyperactive YAP/TAZ pathway, and lack proper intercellular TJs. Consistently, blood vessels are hyperpermeable, and intravascularly injected cancer cells extravasate more easily in lphn2a null animals. Thus, LPHN2 ligands, such as FLRT2, may be therapeutically exploited to interfere with cancer metastatic dissemination.",,
11557679,"LR11, a mosaic LDL receptor family member, mediates the uptake of ApoE-rich lipoproteins in vitro.","Since the molecular identification of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), an ever increasing number of related proteins have been discovered. These receptors belonging to the LDLR family are thought to play key roles in lipoprotein metabolism in a variety of tissues, including the arterial wall. We have discovered that the expression of a 250-kDa mosaic LDLR-related protein, which we termed LR11 for the presence of 11 LDLR ligand-binding repeats, is markedly induced in smooth muscle cells in the hyperplastic intima of animal models used for the study of atherosclerosis. Here, we demonstrate that the human LR11, when overexpressed in hamster cells, binds and internalizes 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), an in vitro ligand for all receptors belonging to the LDLR family. Furthermore, LR11 binds the apolipoprotein E (apoE)-rich lipoproteins, beta-very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs), with a high affinity similar to that of other members, such as the LDLR and VLDL receptor. RAP and beta-VLDL compete with each other; however, other serum lipoproteins are not able to inhibit their binding. LR11 shows specific binding of apoE-enriched HDL prepared from human cerebrospinal fluid as well as of beta-VLDL, suggesting that the apoE content of lipoproteins is most likely important for mediating the high-affinity binding to the receptor. LR11-overexpressing cells are able to internalize and degrade the bound beta-VLDL; these cells also show increased accumulation of cholesteryl esters when incubated with beta-VLDL. Incubation for 48 hours with beta-VLDL of LR11-overexpressing cells, but not of control cells, promotes the appearance of numerous intracellular lipid droplets. Taken together, LR11, a mosaic LDLR family member whose expression in smooth muscle cells is markedly induced in atheroma, has all the properties of a receptor for the endocytosis of lipoproteins, particularly for the incorporation of apoE-rich lipoproteins.","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2001

22340494,LRP2 is an auxiliary SHH receptor required to condition the forebrain ventral midline for inductive signals.,"Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is a regulator of forebrain development that acts through its receptor, patched 1. However, little is known about cellular mechanisms at neurulation, whereby SHH from the prechordal plate governs specification of the rostral diencephalon ventral midline (RDVM), a major forebrain organizer. We identified LRP2, a member of the LDL receptor gene family, as a component of the SHH signaling machinery in the RDVM. LRP2 acts as an apical SHH-binding protein that sequesters SHH in its target field and controls internalization and cellular trafficking of SHH/patched 1 complexes. Lack of LRP2 in mice and in cephalic explants results in failure to respond to SHH, despite functional expression of patched 1 and smoothened, whereas overexpression of LRP2 variants in cells increases SHH signaling capacity. Our data identify a critical role for LRP2 in SHH signaling and reveal the molecular mechanism underlying forebrain anomalies in mice and patients with Lrp2 defects.",Developmental cell,2012
18848351,Lrp4 is a receptor for Agrin and forms a complex with MuSK.,"Neuromuscular synapse formation requires a complex exchange of signals between motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers, leading to the accumulation of postsynaptic proteins, including acetylcholine receptors in the muscle membrane and specialized release sites, or active zones in the presynaptic nerve terminal. MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed in skeletal muscle, and Agrin, a motor neuron-derived ligand that stimulates MuSK phosphorylation, play critical roles in synaptic differentiation, as synapses do not form in their absence, and mutations in MuSK or downstream effectors are a major cause of a group of neuromuscular disorders, termed congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). How Agrin activates MuSK and stimulates synaptic differentiation is not known and remains a fundamental gap in our understanding of signaling at neuromuscular synapses. Here, we report that Lrp4, a member of the LDLR family, is a receptor for Agrin, forms a complex with MuSK, and mediates MuSK activation by Agrin.",,
19936252,"Lrp4, a novel receptor for Dickkopf 1 and sclerostin, is expressed by osteoblasts and regulates bone growth and turnover in vivo.","Lrp4 is a multifunctional member of the low density lipoprotein-receptor gene family and a modulator of extracellular cell signaling pathways in development. For example, Lrp4 binds Wise, a secreted Wnt modulator and BMP antagonist. Lrp4 shares structural elements within the extracellular ligand binding domain with Lrp5 and Lrp6, two established Wnt co-receptors with important roles in osteogenesis. Sclerostin is a potent osteocyte secreted inhibitor of bone formation that directly binds Lrp5 and Lrp6 and modulates both BMP and Wnt signaling. The anti-osteogenic effect of sclerostin is thought to be mediated mainly by inhibition of Wnt signaling through Lrp5/6 within osteoblasts. Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) is another potent soluble Wnt inhibitor that binds to Lrp5 and Lrp6, can displace Lrp5-bound sclerostin and is itself regulated by BMPs. In a recent genome-wide association study of bone mineral density a significant modifier locus was detected near the SOST gene at 17q21, which encodes sclerostin. In addition, nonsynonymous SNPs in the LRP4 gene were suggestively associated with bone mineral density. Here we show that Lrp4 is expressed in bone and cultured osteoblasts and binds Dkk1 and sclerostin in vitro. MicroCT analysis of Lrp4 deficient mutant mice revealed shortened total femur length, reduced cortical femoral perimeter, and reduced total femur bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD). Lumbar spine trabecular bone volume per total volume (BV/TV) was significantly reduced in the mutants and the serum and urinary bone turnover markers alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and desoxypyridinoline were increased. We conclude that Lrp4 is a novel osteoblast expressed Dkk1 and sclerostin receptor with a physiological role in the regulation of bone growth and turnover, which is likely mediated through its function as an integrator of Wnt and BMP signaling pathways.",PloS one,2009
24769443,LSECtin expressed on melanoma cells promotes tumor progression by inhibiting antitumor T-cell responses.,"Therapeutic antibodies that target T-cell co-inhibitory molecules display potent antitumor effects in multiple types of cancer. LSECtin is a cell surface lectin of the DC-SIGN family expressed in dendritic cells that inhibits T-cell responses. LSECtin limits T-cell activity in infectious disease, but it has not been studied in cancer. Here we report the finding that LSECtin is expressed commonly in melanomas where it blunts tumor-specific T-cell responses. When expressed in B16 melanoma cells, LSECtin promoted tumor growth, whereas its blockade slowed tumor growth in either wild-type or LSECtin-deficient mice. The tumor-promoting effects of LSECtin were abrogated in Rag1(-/-) mice or in response to CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-cell depletion. Mechanistic investigations determined that LSECtin inhibited the proliferation of tumor-specific effector T cells by downregulating the cell cycle kinases CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Accordingly, as expressed in B16, tumor cells LSECtin inhibited tumor-specific T-cell responses relying upon proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Notably, LSECtin interacted with the co-regulatory molecule LAG-3, the blockade of which restored IFNγ secretion that was reduced by melanoma-derived expression of LSECtin. Together, our findings reveal that common expression of LSECtin in melanoma cells engenders a mechanism of immune escape, with implications for novel immunotherapeutic combination strategies.",,
11133776,Lutheran blood group glycoprotein and its newly characterized mouse homologue specifically bind alpha5 chain-containing human laminin with high affinity.,"Lutheran blood group glycoproteins (Lu gps) are receptors for the extracellular matrix protein, laminin. Studies suggest that Lu gps may contribute to vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease and it has recently been shown that sickle cells adhere to laminin isoforms containing the alpha5 chain (laminin 10/11). Laminin alpha5 is present in the subendothelium and is also a constituent of bone marrow sinusoids, suggesting a role for the Lu/laminin interaction in erythropoiesis. The objectives of the current study were to define more precisely the molecular interactions of the extracellular and intracellular regions of human Lu and to clone and characterize a mouse homologue. To this end, complementary DNA and genomic clones for the mouse homologue were sequenced and the mouse Lu gene mapped to a region on chromosome 7 with conserved synteny with human 19q13.2. Mouse and human Lu gps are highly conserved (72% identity) at the amino acid sequence level and both mouse and human Lu gps specifically bind laminin 10/11 with high affinity. Furthermore, the first 3, N-terminal, immunoglobulin superfamily domains of human Lu are critical for this interaction. The results indicated that the cytoplasmic domain of BRIC 221-labeled human Lu gp is linked with the spectrin-based skeleton, affording the speculation that this interaction may be critical for signal transduction. These results further support a role for Lu gps in sickle cell disease and indicate the utility of mouse models to explore the function of Lu gp-laminin 10/11 interaction in normal erythropoiesis and in sickle cell disease.",,
1730778,Lymphocyte CD44 binds the COOH-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin.,"The lymphocyte-high endothelial venule (HEV) cell interaction is an essential element of the immune system, as it controls lymphocyte recirculation between blood and lymphoid organs in the body. This interaction involves an 85-95-kD class of lymphocyte surface glycoprotein(s), CD44. A subset of lymphocyte CD44 molecules is modified by covalent linkage to chondroitin sulfate (Jalkanen, S., M. Jalkanen, R. Bargatze, M. Tammi, and E. C. Butcher. 1988. J. Immunol. 141:1615-1623). In this work, we show that removal of chondroitin sulfate by chondroitinase treatment of lymphocytes or incubation of HEV with chondroitin sulfate does not significantly inhibit lymphocyte binding to HEV, suggesting that chondroitin sulfate is not involved in endothelial cell recognition of lymphocytes. Affinity-purified CD44 antigen was, on the other hand, observed to bind native Type I collagen fibrils, laminin, and fibronectin, but not gelatin. Binding to fibronectin was studied more closely, and it was found to be mediated through the chondroitin sulfate-containing form of the molecule. The binding site on fibronectin was the COOH-terminal heparin binding domain, because (a) the COOH-terminal heparin-binding fragment of fibronectin-bound isolated CD44 antigen; (b) chondroitin sulfate inhibited this binding; and (c) finally, the ectodomain of another cell surface proteoglycan, syndecan, which is known to bind the COOH-terminal heparin binding domain of fibronectin (Saunders, S., and M. Bernfield. 1988. J. Cell Biol. 106: 423-430), inhibited binding of CD44 both to intact fibronectin and to its heparin binding domain. Moreover, inhibition studies showed that binding of a lymphoblastoid cell line, KCA, to heparin binding peptides from COOH-terminal heparin binding fragment of fibronectin was mediated via CD44. These findings suggest that recirculating lymphocytes use the CD44 class of molecules not only for binding to HEV at the site of lymphocyte entry to lymphoid organs as reported earlier but also within the lymphatic tissue where CD44, especially the subset modified by chondroitin sulfate, is used for interaction with extracellular matrix molecules such as fibronectin.",The Journal of cell biology,1992
8600538,Lymphocyte homing and homeostasis.,"The integration and control of systemic immune responses depends on the regulated trafficking of lymphocytes. This lymphocyte ""homing"" process disperses the immunologic repertoire, directs lymphocyte subsets to the specialized microenvironments that control their differentiation and regulate their survival, and targets immune effector cells to sites of antigenic or microbial invasion. Recent advances reveal that the exquisite specificity of lymphocyte homing is determined by combinatorial ""decision processes"" involving multistep sequential engagement of adhesion and signaling receptors. These homing-related interactions are seamlessly integrated into the overall interaction of the lymphocyte with its environment and participate directly in the control of lymphocyte function, life-span, and population dynamics. In this article a review of the molecular basis of lymphocyte homing is presented, and mechanisms by which homing physiology regulated the homeostasis of immunologic resources are proposed.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1996
7916655,"Lymphotoxin beta, a novel member of the TNF family that forms a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin on the cell surface.","The lymphokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has a well-defined role as an inducer of inflammatory responses; however, the function of the structurally related molecule lymphotoxin (LT alpha) is unknown. LT alpha is present on the surface of activated T, B, and LAK cells as a complex with a 33 kd glycoprotein, and cloning of the cDNA encoding the associated protein, called lymphotoxin beta (LT beta), revealed it to be a type II membrane protein with significant homology to TNF, LT alpha, and the ligand for the CD40 receptor. The gene for LT beta was found next to the TNF-LT locus in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a region of the MHC with possible linkage to autoimmune disease. These observations raise the possibility that a surface LT alpha-LT beta complex may have a specific role in immune regulation distinct from the functions ascribed to TNF.",,
8123048,Lymphotoxin lacks effects on 75-kDa receptors in cytotoxicity on U-937 cells.,"We examined differences in cytotoxic activity between human lymphotoxin (LT) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as functions of their interaction with two types of TNF receptors, 55-kDa (p55R) and 75-kDa (p75R). Cytotoxic activity of LT was much lower than that of TNF on a human monocytic cell line, U-937, on which p75R was predominant. Monoclonal antibodies specific for p55R (htr-5 and htr-9) and p75R (utr-1) significantly diminished TNF cytotoxicity, whereas, utr-1 was only slightly inhibitory to LT cytotoxicity, and htr-5 reduced it significantly. TNF individual binding to p75R increased cytotoxic activity when p55R was occupied by htr-9 and a mutein of TNF which significantly lost affinity to p75R. However, LT binding to p75R did not increase. Scatchard analysis with [125I]LT and [125I]TNF showed that LT still had approximately half of the affinity to p75R and slightly less affinity to p55R than TNF. These results indicate slight cytotoxicity of LT compared to TNF, due to inability of LT to signal through p75R on U-937 cells without significant loss of affinity to p75R.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1994
8579602,Lysine 173 residue within the first exoloop of rat secretin receptor is involved in carboxylate moiety recognition of Asp 3 in secretin.,"The contribution of the extracellular loops of the secretin receptor to the recognition of secretin was investigated by transfection in CHO cells of chimeric receptors, in which the three loops of the secretin recombinant receptor were replaced by the corresponding sequences of the glucagon receptor. The role of the third loop could not be evaluated as the transfected cells did not respond to secretin. Replacement of extracellular loop 2 reduced markedly the capability of secretin to occupy the receptor but did not alter the capacity of the receptor to discriminate between peptide analogues modified in position 3. Replacement of the first extracellular loop not only reduced the potency of secretin but also decreased the capacity of the receptor to discriminate between ligands having in position 3 an aspartate (as in secretin), an asparagine, or a glutamic acid. This change in receptor properties was reproduced by a single mutation of lysine 173 of the receptor into isoleucine. Thus, the basic amino acid in position 173 is likely to interact with aspartate 3 of secretin. As an aspartate is also present in position 3 of VIP and PACAP, two peptides related to secretin, and a lysine residue is conserved in the first extracellular loop of the VIP and PACAP receptors, this interaction may be a key element of peptide recognition by this receptor family.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1996
12972292,Lysosomal traffic of liganded endothelin B receptor.,"The endothelin B receptor (ETB) is an endothelial cell receptor found in caveolae. Studies with GFP-tagged ETB have suggested that the protein is constitutively endocytosed and targeted to lysosomes where it is rapidly degraded. We report that iodinated endothelin-1 ligand (ET-1) is taken up by cells transfected with ETB and remains undegraded for at least 17 h. Analysis of the intracellular traffic of endocytosed ET-1 on isotonic Ficoll gradients shows that it is rapidly internalised to lysosomes by a chloroquine sensitive and cholesterol dependent pathway. Low-temperature nonreducing SDS gels show that the ET-1 initially binds to full-length GFP-tagged ETB, which is rapidly clipped at the amino-terminus and is then stable for at least 6 h. Analysis of GFP tagged ETB on reducing SDS gels shows that it is proteolytically cleaved with a half time of approximately 3 h. However, nonreducing gels show that the receptor is virtually intact, suffering only a similar cleavage to the liganded receptor. We conclude that the ETB receptor shows remarkable stability in lysosomes, held together by disulfide bonds, and maintaining ligand binding for long periods of time.",,
9501082,"Mac-2 binding protein is a cell-adhesive protein of the extracellular matrix which self-assembles into ring-like structures and binds beta1 integrins, collagens and fibronectin.","Human Mac-2 binding protein (M2BP) was prepared in recombinant form from the culture medium of 293 kidney cells and consisted of a 92 kDa subunit. The protein was obtained in a native state as indicated by CD spectroscopy, demonstrating alpha-helical and beta-type structure, and by protease resistance and immunological analysis. It was highly modified by N- and O-glycosylation but not by glycosaminoglycans. Ultracentrifugation showed non-covalent association into oligomers with molar masses of 1000-1500 kDa. Electron microscopy showed ring-like shapes with diameters of 30-40 nm. M2BP bound in solid-phase assays to collagens IV, V and VI, fibronectin and nidogen, but not to fibrillar collagens I and III or other basement membrane proteins. The protein also mediated adhesion of cell lines at comparable strength with laminin. Adhesion to M2BP was inhibited by antibodies to integrin beta1 subunits but not to alpha2 and alpha6 subunits, RGD peptide or lactose. This distinguishes cell adhesion of M2BP from that of laminin and excludes involvement of lactose-binding galectin-3. Immunological assays demonstrated variable secretion by cultured human cells of M2BP, which was detected in the extracellular matrix of several mouse tissues.",The EMBO journal,1998
9430724,Macrophage-derived chemokine is a functional ligand for the CC chemokine receptor 4.,"Macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) is a recently identified member of the CC chemokine family. MDC is not closely related to other chemokines, sharing most similarity with thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), which contains 37% identical amino acids. Both chemokines are highly expressed in the thymus, with little expression seen in other tissues. In addition, the genes for MDC and TARC are encoded by human chromosome 16. To explore this relationship in greater detail, we have more precisely localized the MDC gene to chromosome 16q13, the same position reported for the TARC gene. We have also examined the interaction of MDC with CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), recently shown to be a receptor for TARC. Using a fusion protein of MDC with secreted alkaline phosphatase, we observed high affinity binding of MDC-secreted alkaline phosphatase to CCR4-transfected L1.2 cells (Kd = 0.18 nM). MDC and TARC competed for binding to CCR4, while no binding competition was observed for six other chemokines (MCP-1, MCP-3, MCP-4, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta). MDC was tested for calcium mobilization in L1.2 cells tranfected with seven different CC chemokine receptors. MDC induced a calcium flux in CCR4-transfected cells, but other receptors did not respond to MDC. TARC, which also induced calcium mobilization in CCR4 transfectants, was unable to desensitize the response to MDC. In contrast, MDC fully desensitized a subsequent response to TARC. Both MDC and TARC functioned as chemoattractants for CCR4 transfectants, confirming that MDC is also a functional ligand for CCR4. Since MDC and TARC are both expressed in the thymus, one role for these chemokines may be to attract CCR4-bearing thymocytes in the process of T cell education and differentiation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
9842903,"MAdCAM-1 costimulates T cell proliferation exclusively through integrin alpha4beta7, whereas VCAM-1 and CS-1 peptide use alpha4beta1: evidence for ""remote"" costimulation and induction of hyperresponsiveness to B7 molecules.","We have analyzed the effects of the alpha4 integrin ligands mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and the fibronectin CS-1 splice variant on T cell activation. Immobilized MAdCAM-1 and VCAM-1 IgG-Fc chimeras and a fibronectin CS-1 peptide efficiently costimulate T cell proliferation when antigen presentation is mimicked by anti-CD3 antibody. VCAM-1-Fc and fibronectin CS-1, which are adhesive ligands for both the alpha4beta1 and alpha4beta7 integrins, medicate T cell costimulation exclusively through integrin alpha4beta1, but not through alpha4beta7. The inability of VCAM-1-Fc to costimulate via alpha4beta7 suggests that cell adhesion per se is insufficient, and that exquisite recognition and activation events must be triggered. MAdCAM-1-Fc mediates costimulation exclusively via alpha4beta7, and can both synergize with and induce hyperresponsiveness to the classical costimulator B7-2. MAdCAM-1-Fc and VCAM-1-Fc, but not B7-2, effectively costimulate when immobilized on sites spatially distant from the anti-CD3 antibody (""remote"" costimulation). In vitro, the relative potencies of the CAM were VCAM-1-Fc> ICAM-1-Fc> MAdCAM-1-Fc > B7-Fc, except at high concentrations where ICAM-1 was the most potent. Features of costimulatory CAM revealed by this study have important implications for the design of immunotherapeutic vaccine strategies to combat cancer and infection.",,
15894287,"Magic roundabout, a tumor endothelial marker: expression and signaling.","Molecular signals that guide blood vessels to specific paths are not fully deciphered, but are thought to be similar to signals that mediate neuronal guidance. These cues are not only critical for normal blood vessel development, but may also play a major role in tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we have demonstrated the tumor endothelial specific expression of a Robo family member, magic roundabout (MRB), functionally characterized its role in endothelial cell migration and defined a signaling pathway that might mediate this function. We show that MRB is differentially over-expressed in tumor endothelial cells versus normal adult endothelial cells in numerous solid tumors. Moreover, over-expression of MRB in endothelial cells activates MRB in a ligand-independent fashion, and activation of MRB via Slit2, a putative ligand, results in inhibition of VEGF and FGF induced migration. We also demonstrate that MRB induced inhibition of endothelial migration is partially mediated by the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk signaling pathway. We therefore hypothesize that expression of MRB is involved in regulating the migration of endothelial cells during tumor angiogenesis.",,
10364234,Mammalian homologues of the Drosophila slit protein are ligands of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1 in brain.,"Using an affinity matrix in which a recombinant glypican-Fc fusion protein expressed in 293 cells was coupled to protein A-Sepharose, we have isolated from rat brain at least two proteins that were detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single 200-kDa silver-stained band, from which 16 partial peptide sequences were obtained by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Mouse expressed sequence tags containing two of these peptides were employed for oligonucleotide design and synthesis of probes by polymerase chain reaction and enabled us to isolate from a rat brain cDNA library a 4.1-kilobase clone that encoded two of our peptide sequences and represented the N-terminal portion of a protein containing a signal peptide and three leucine-rich repeats. Comparisons with recently published sequences also showed that our peptides were derived from proteins that are members of the Slit/MEGF protein family, which share a number of structural features such as N-terminal leucine-rich repeats and C-terminal epidermal growth factor-like motifs, and in Drosophila Slit is necessary for the development of midline glia and commissural axon pathways. All of the five known rat and human Slit proteins contain 1523-1534 amino acids, and our peptide sequences correspond best to those present in human Slit-1 and Slit-2. Binding of these ligands to the glypican-Fc fusion protein requires the presence of the heparan sulfate chains, but the interaction appears to be relatively specific for glypican-1 insofar as no other identified heparin-binding proteins were isolated using our affinity matrix. Northern analysis demonstrated the presence of two mRNA species of 8. 6 and 7.5 kilobase pairs using probes based on both N- and C-terminal sequences, and in situ hybridization histochemistry showed that these glypican-1 ligands are synthesized by neurons, such as hippocampal pyramidal cells and cerebellar granule cells, where we have previously also demonstrated glypican-1 mRNA and immunoreactivity. Our results therefore indicate that Slit family proteins are functional ligands of glypican-1 in nervous tissue and suggest that their interactions may be critical for certain stages of central nervous system histogenesis.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999

It is a new member of the family of Wnt receptor proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the Ryk receptor functions remain unknown. Here, we report that mammalian Ryk, unlike the Drosophila Ryk homolog Derailed, functions as a coreceptor along with Frizzled for Wnt ligands. Ryk also binds to Dishevelled, through which it activates the canonical Wnt pathway, providing a link between Wnt and Dishevelled. Transgenic mice expressing Ryk siRNA exhibit defects in axon guidance, and Ryk is required for neurite outgrowth induced by Wnt-3a and in the activation of T cell factor (TCF) induced by Wnt-1. Thus, Ryk appears to play a crucial role in Wnt-mediated signaling.",,
11346656,"Manic fringe and lunatic fringe modify different sites of the Notch2 extracellular region, resulting in different signaling modulation.","Three mammalian fringe proteins are implicated in controlling Notch activation by Delta/Serrate/Lag2 ligands during tissue boundary formation. It was proved recently that they are glycosyltransferases that initiate elongation of O-linked fucose residues attached to epidermal growth factor-like sequence repeats in the extracellular domain of Notch molecules. Here we demonstrate the existence of functional diversity among the mammalian fringe proteins. Although both manic fringe (mFng) and lunatic fringe (lFng) decreased the binding of Jagged1 to Notch2 and not that of Delta1, the decrease by mFng was greater in degree than that by lFng. We also found that both fringe proteins reduced Jagged1-triggered Notch2 signaling, whereas neither affected Delta1-triggered Notch2 signaling. However, the decrease in Jagged1-triggered Notch2 signaling by mFng was again greater than that by lFng. Furthermore, we observed that each fringe protein acted on a different site of the extracellular region of Notch2. Taking these findings together, we propose that the difference in modulatory function of multiple fringe proteins may result from the distinct amino acid sequence specificity targeted by these glycosyltransferases.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
11081635,Mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor is a death receptor for granzyme B during cytotoxic T cell-induced apoptosis.,"The serine proteinase granzyme B is crucial for the rapid induction of target cell apoptosis by cytotoxic T cells. Granzyme B was recently demonstrated to enter cells in a perforin-independent manner, thus predicting the existence of a cell surface receptor(s). We now present evidence that this receptor is the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor receptor (CI-MPR). Inhibition of the granzyme B-CI-MPR interaction prevented granzyme B cell surface binding, uptake, and the induction of apoptosis. Significantly, expression of the CI-MPR was essential for cytotoxic T cell-mediated apoptosis of target cells in vitro and for the rejection of allogeneic cells in vivo. These results suggest a novel target for immunotherapy and a potential mechanism used by tumors for immune evasion.",,

We have searched for mechanisms that determine the cellular location of uPAR and may participate in its disposal. When using purified receptor preparations, we find that uPAR binds to the cation-independent, mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) receptor (CIMPR) with an affinity in the low micromolar range, but not to the 46-kD, cation-dependent, mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CDMPR). The binding is not perturbed by uPA and appears to involve domains DII + DIII of the uPAR protein moiety, but not the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The binding occurs at site(s) on the CIMPR different from those engaged in binding of mannose 6-phosphate epitopes or IGF-II. To evaluate the significance of the binding, immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy studies were performed in transfected cells, and the results show that wild-type CIMPR, but not CIMPR lacking an intact sorting signal, modulates the subcellular distribution of uPAR and is capable of directing it to lysosomes. We conclude that a site within CIMPR, distinct from its previously known ligand binding sites, binds uPAR and modulates its subcellular distribution.",,
27601670,Mannose receptor induces T-cell tolerance via inhibition of CD45 and up-regulation of CTLA-4.,"The mannose receptor (MR) is an endocytic receptor involved in serum homeostasis and antigen presentation. Here, we identify the MR as a direct regulator of CD8(+) T-cell activity. We demonstrate that MR expression on dendritic cells (DCs) impaired T-cell cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. This regulatory effect of the MR was mediated by a direct interaction with CD45 on the T cell, inhibiting its phosphatase activity, which resulted in up-regulation of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated Protein 4 (CTLA-4) and the induction of T-cell tolerance. Inhibition of CD45 prevented expression of B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6), a transcriptional inhibitor that directly bound the CTLA-4 promoter and regulated its activity. These data demonstrate that endocytic receptors expressed on DCs contribute to the regulation of T-cell functionality.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2016
10574949,Mapping ligand binding domains in chimeric fibroblast growth factor receptor molecules. Multiple regions determine ligand binding specificity.,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate essential cellular functions by activating one of four alternatively spliced FGF receptors (FGFRs). To determine the mechanism regulating ligand binding affinity and specificity, soluble FGFR1 and FGFR3 binding domains were compared for activity. FGFR1 bound well to FGF2 but poorly to FGF8 and FGF9. In contrast, FGFR3 bound well to FGF8 and FGF9 but poorly to FGF2. The differential ligand binding specificity of these two receptors was exploited to map specific ligand binding regions in mutant and chimeric receptor molecules. Deletion of immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain I did not effect ligand binding, thus localizing the binding region(s) to the distal two Ig domains. Mapping studies identified two regions that contribute to FGF binding. Additionally, FGF2 binding showed positive cooperativity, suggesting the presence of two binding sites on a single FGFR or two interacting sites on an FGFR dimer. Analysis of FGF8 and FGF9 binding to chimeric receptors showed that a broad region spanning Ig domain II and sequences further N-terminal determines binding specificity for these ligands. These data demonstrate that multiple regions of the FGFR regulate ligand binding specificity and that these regions are distinct with respect to different members of the FGF family.",,

9334232,Mapping peptide-binding domains of the human V1a vasopressin receptor with a photoactivatable linear peptide antagonist.,"The study of antagonist-binding domains of the human V1a vasopressin receptor was performed using a radioiodinated photoreactive peptide antagonist. This ligand displayed a high affinity for the receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes, and specifically labeled two protein bands with apparent molecular mass at 85-90 and 46 kDa. Our results clearly show that the V1a receptor is degraded during incubation with the ligand and that the 46-kDa species is probably the result of the 85-90-kDa species proteolytic cleavage. Truncation of the receptor was then confirmed by deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F. A monoclonal antibody directed against a c-Myc epitope added at the receptor NH2 terminus allowed immunoprecipitation of the 85-90-kDa photolabeled species. The 46-kDa photolabeled protein never immunoprecipitated, indicating that the truncated form of the receptor lacks the NH2 terminus region. To localize photolabeled domains of the receptor, the 46-kDa protein was cleaved with V8 and/or Lys-C endoproteinases. The identity of the smallest photolabeled fragment, observed at approximately 6 kDa, was then confirmed by mutation of the potential V8 cleavage sites. Our results indicate that covalent labeling of the vasopressin V1a receptor with the photoreactive antagonist occurs in a region including transmembrane domain VII (residues Asn327-Lys370).",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997

We previously demonstrated that gp17 binds to CD4 with high affinity and strongly inhibits T lymphocyte apoptosis induced by sequential cross-linking of CD4 and T cell receptor (TCR). To further characterize the gp17/CD4 interaction and map the gp17 binding site, we produced a secreted form of recombinant gp17 fused to human IgG1 Fc, gp17-Ig. We showed that gp17-Ig exhibits a binding affinity for CD4 similar to that of native gp17. As no information about gp17 structure is presently available, 99 overlapping gp17 peptides were synthesized by the Spot method, which allowed the mapping of two CD4 binding regions. Alanine scanning of CD4-reactive peptides identified critical residues, selected for site-directed mutagenesis. Nine gp17-Ig mutants were generated and characterized. Three residues within the carboxy-terminal region were identified as the major binding domain to CD4. The Spot method combined with mutagenesis represents a refined approach to distinguish the contact residues from the ones contributing to the conformation of the CD4-binding domain.",Biochemistry,2000
9452434,Mapping the charged residues in the second immunoglobulin-like domain of the vascular endothelial growth factor/placenta growth factor receptor Flt-1 required for binding and structural stability.,"Flt-1 is one of two receptor tyrosine kinases through which the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) functions. Placenta growth factor (PlGF) is an additional ligand for Flt-1. The second immunoglobulin-like domain in the extracellular domain of Flt-1 has previously been identified as the region containing the critical ligand-binding determinants. We analyzed the contribution of charged residues within the first three domains of Flt-1 to ligand binding by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Domain 2 residues Arg159, Glu208 and His223-Arg224 (together) affect both VEGF and PlGF binding, while Glu137, Lys171, His223, and Arg224 affect PlGF but not VEGF. Several charged residues, especially Asp187, are important in maintaining the structural integrity of domain 2. In addition, some residues in domain 3 contribute to binding (Asp231) or provide for additional discrimination between ligands (Arg280-Asp283).",,
7852363,Mapping the domain(s) critical for the binding of human tumor necrosis factor-alpha to its two receptors.,"The extracellular domains of the two human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors critical for binding TNF-alpha were examined by deletion mapping. The ligand binding capability of full-length and truncated recombinant soluble TNF receptors (TNFRs) was assessed by ligand blot analysis and their binding affinity determined by Scatchard analysis. The results showed that deletion of the fourth cysteine-rich domain of the p55 receptor (TNFR-1) did not alter ligand binding affinity significantly. Deletion of domains 3 and 4 of TNFR-1 resulted in no ligand binding, suggesting that domain 3, but not 4, of TNFR-1 binds directly to ligand. Deletion of domain 4 of TNFR-2 resulted in drastically reduced protein yield and 3-fold reduction in ligand binding affinity, while deletion of both domains 4 and 3 yielded no protein. Thus, the domain 4 of TNFR-2, but not that of TNFR-1, appears to be involved directly in binding TNF, although it is also possible that the domain 4 of TNFR-2 is involved in the correct folding of other domains. These results suggest that the modes of interaction between TNF-alpha and its dual receptors are different, providing opportunity to modulate each receptor specifically for research and therapeutic purposes.",,
14764580,Mapping the interaction between high molecular mass kininogen and the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor.,"The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a multifunctional, GPI-linked receptor that modulates cell adhesion/migration and fibrinolysis. We mapped the interaction sites between soluble uPAR (suPAR) and high molecular mass kininogen (HK). Binding of biotin-HK to suPAR was inhibited by HK, 56HKa, and 46HKa with an IC50 of 60, 110, and 8 nm, respectively. We identified two suPAR-binding sites, a higher affinity site in the light chain of HK and 46HKa (His477-Gly496) and a lower affinity site within the heavy chain (Cys333-Lys345). HK predominantly bound to suPAR fragments containing domains 2 and 3 (S-D2D3). Binding of HK to domain 1 (S-D1) was also detected, and the addition of S-D1 to S-D2D3 completely inhibited biotin-HK or -46HKa binding to suPAR. Using sequential and overlapping 20-amino acid peptides prepared from suPAR, two regions for HK binding were identified. One on the carboxyl-terminal end of D2 (Leu166-Thr195) blocked HK binding to suPAR and to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). This site overlapped with the urokinase-binding region, and urokinase inhibited the binding of HK to suPAR. A second region on the amino-terminal portion of D3 (Gln215-Asn255) also blocked HK binding to HUVEC. Peptides that blocked HK binding to uPAR also inhibited prekallikrein activation on HUVEC. Therefore, HK interacts with suPAR at several sites. HK binds to uPAR as part of its interaction with its multiprotein receptor complex on HUVEC, and the biological functions that depend upon this binding are modulated by urokinase.",,
9786897,Mapping the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and -2 binding site on the inserted domain of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1.,"By extensive mutagenic analysis of the inserted domain (I-domain) of the alpha-chain (CD11a) of the leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), we have defined a putative binding surface for intercellular adhesion molecules 1 and 2 (ICAM-1 and -2). This analysis showed that individually mutating Leu-205 or Glu-241 to alanine completely abolished LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 or -2 without affecting I-domain structure, as assayed by antibody binding. Mutating Thr-243 to alanine also had a profound effect on LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 and -2, as seen by complete loss of binding to ICAM-1 and a significant reduction (70% decrease) in binding to ICAM-2. Mutating Glu-146 to alanine reduced LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 or -2 by 70%, and mutating His-264 or Glu-293 to alanine reduced binding to ICAM-1 or -2 by about 30-40%. Mutating Thr-175 to alanine reduced binding to ICAM-1 by about 30% and binding to ICAM-2 by about 70%. Interestingly, mutating Lys-263 to alanine preferentially abolished LFA-1 binding to ICAM-2. Using these data, we have generated a model of the interface between the LFA-1 I-domain and residues in the first domain of ICAM-1 that have been shown to be critical for this interaction. In addition, this model, together with the ICAM-2 crystal structure, has been used to map residues that are likely to mediate LFA-1 I-domain binding to ICAM-2.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
17138938,Mass-spectrometric identification of a novel angiotensin peptide in human plasma.,"Angiotensin peptides play a central role in cardiovascular physiology and pathology. Among these peptides, angiotensin II (Ang II) has been investigated most intensively. However, further angiotensin peptides such as Ang 1-7, Ang III, and Ang IV also contribute to vascular regulation, and may elicit additional, different, or even opposite effects to Ang II. Here, we describe a novel Ang II-related, strong vasoconstrictive substance in plasma from healthy humans and end-stage renal failure patients.",,
18794339,Mast cell-expressed orphan receptor CCRL2 binds chemerin and is required for optimal induction of IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis.,"Mast cells contribute importantly to both protective and pathological IgE-dependent immune responses. We show that the mast cell-expressed orphan serpentine receptor mCCRL2 is not required for expression of IgE-mediated mast cell-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis but can enhance the tissue swelling and leukocyte infiltrates associated with such reactions in mice. We further identify chemerin as a natural nonsignaling protein ligand for both human and mouse CCRL2. In contrast to other ""silent"" or professional chemokine interreceptors, chemerin binding does not trigger ligand internalization. Rather, CCRL2 is able to bind the chemoattractant and increase local concentrations of bioactive chemerin, thus providing a link between CCRL2 expression and inflammation via the cell-signaling chemerin receptor CMKLR1.",,
17638887,Matrix metalloproteinase 7 mediates mammary epithelial cell tumorigenesis through the ErbB4 receptor.,"To delineate the role of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) in mammary tumorigenesis, MMP7 was expressed in the normal murine mammary gland cell line, c57MG. MMP7 markedly enhanced the growth rate of the c57MG cells in three-dimensional culture and promoted tumor formation in vivo. Subsequent investigation showed that MMP7 (a) up-regulated ErbB4 receptor levels, (b) solubilized the ErbB4 receptor cognate ligand heparin-bound epidermal growth factor, and (c) mediated the proteolytic processing of ErbB4 to yield a soluble intracellular domain (ICD) that localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Furthermore, overexpression of the ErbB4 ICD in the c57MG cell line recapitulated the proliferative effects of MMP7 in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate a novel mechanism for mammary epithelial cell transformation by MMP7.",,
12149192,Matrix metalloproteinase processing of monocyte chemoattractant proteins generates CC chemokine receptor antagonists with anti-inflammatory properties in vivo.,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-3 is inactivated upon cleavage by the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gelatinase A (MMP-2). We investigated the susceptibility to proteolytic processing of the 4 human MCPs by 8 recombinant MMPs to determine whether MCP-3 is an isolated example or represents a general susceptibility of chemokines to proteolytic inactivation by these important inflammatory proteases. In addition to MMP-2, MCP-3 is efficiently cleaved by membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP, the cellular activator of MMP-2, and by collagenase-1 and collagenase-3 (MMP-1, MMP-13) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3). Specificity was shown by absence of cleavage by matrilysin (MMP-7) and the leukocytic MMPs neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) and gelatinase B (MMP-9). The closely related chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-4 were not cleaved by MMP-2 or MT1-MMP, but were cleaved by MMP-1 and MMP-3 with varying efficiency. MCPs were typically cleaved between residues 4 and 5, but MCP-4 was further processed at Val7-Pro8. Synthetic MCP analogs corresponding to the MMP-cleaved forms bound CC chemokine receptor (CCR)-2 and CCR-3, but lacked chemoattractant activity in pre-B cells transfected with CCR-2 and CCR-3 or in THP-1 monocytic cells, a transformed leukemic cell line. Moreover, the truncated products of MCP-2 and MCP-4, like MCP-3, were potent antagonists of their cognate CC chemokine receptors in transwell cell migration assays in vitro. When they were injected 24 hours after the initiation of carrageenan-induced inflammation in rat paws, their in vivo antagonist activities were revealed by a greater than 66% reduction in inflammatory edema progression after 12 hours. We propose that MMPs have an important role in modulating inflammatory and immune responses by processing chemokines in wound healing and in disease.",,
409677,Matrix protein from influenza A virus and its role in cross-protection in mice.,"The matrix (M) protein of influenza A virus, one of the two group-specific internal proteins of the virion, was isolated in a pure form, and its immunogenicity was stable to heating at 100 degrees C for 2 min. Mice immunized with isolated M protein in complete Freund adjuvant and subsequently infected with influenza virus cleared virus more rapidly from their lungs than did unimmunized mice. Despite the rapid clearance of virus, the mice developed pneumonia that was at least as severe as in unimmunized mice. Preliminary studies suggest that the rapid clearance of influenza virus from the lungs of mice immunized with M protein may be initiated by a cell-mediated rather than a humoral response. The mechanism by which a cross-reactive internal virion protein can initiate clearance of the different subtypes of influenza is not clear. Perhaps the M protein is exposed on the surface of the virus-infected cell and is responsible for the cross-reactivity at the cytotoxic T-cell level recently detected between influenza A virus subtypes.",,

11162558,MDC-9 (ADAM-9/Meltrin gamma) functions as an adhesion molecule by binding the alpha(v)beta(5) integrin.,"MDC-9 is a widely expressed member of the metalloproteinase/disintegrin/cysteine-rich protein family. The disintegrin domain of MDC-9 lacks an RGD motif but has recently been reported to bind the alpha(6)beta(1) integrin; however, it is unclear whether MDC-9 can bind other integrins. In the present study myeloma cells, but not lymphoblastoid cells, were shown to bind to immobilised, recombinantly expressed MDC-9 disintegrin domain (A9dis). Binding was divalent cation-dependent, being supported by Mn(2+) and Ca(2+). Adhesion of myeloma cells to A9dis was completely inhibited by an antibody to the alpha(v)beta(5) integrin but not by antibodies to other subunits. RGD-containing peptides had no effect on binding, suggesting that MDC-9 interacts with alpha(v)beta(5) in an RGD-independent manner. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that myeloma cells, but not lymphoblastoid cells, expressed alpha(v)beta(5) on the cell membrane. These data indicated that the disintegrin domain of MDC-9 can function as an adhesion molecule by interacting with an alpha(v)beta(5) integrin.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2001
10681521,Mechanisms by which soluble endothelial cell protein C receptor modulates protein C and activated protein C function.,"The endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) functions as an important regulator of the protein C anticoagulant pathway by binding protein C and enhancing activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. EPCR binds to both protein C and activated protein C (APC) with high affinity. A soluble form of EPCR (sEPCR) circulates in plasma and inhibits APC anticoagulant activity. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms by which sEPCR modulates APC function. Soluble EPCR inhibited the inactivation of factor Va by APC only in the presence of phospholipid vesicles. By using flow cytometric analysis in the presence of 3 mM CaCl(2) and 0. 6 mM MgCl(2), sEPCR inhibited the binding of protein C and APC to phospholipid vesicles (K(i) = 40 +/- 7 and 33 +/- 4 nM, respectively). Without MgCl(2), the K(i) values increased approximately 4-fold. Double label flow cytometric analysis using fluorescein-APC and Texas Red-sEPCR indicated that the APC.sEPCR complex does not interact with phospholipid vesicles. By using surface plasmon resonance, we found that sEPCR also inhibited binding of protein C to phospholipid in a dose-dependent fashion (K(i) = 32 nM). To explore the possibility that sEPCR evokes structural changes in APC, fluorescence spectroscopy studies were performed to monitor sEPCR/Fl-APC interactions. sEPCR binds saturably to Fl-APC (K(d) = 27 +/- 13 nM) with a maximum decrease in Fl-APC fluorescence of 10.8 +/- 0.6%. sEPCR also stimulated the amidolytic activity of APC toward synthetic substrates. We conclude that sEPCR binding to APC blocks phospholipid interaction and alters the active site of APC.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
11158855,Mechanisms of albumin uptake by proximal tubular cells.,"The likely role of albumin in the induction tubulo-interstitial injury in proteinuria has stimulated considerable interest in the entry of albumin into the proximal tubule and its subsequent uptake by proximal tubular cells. Currently, there is considerable controversy over the degree of glomerular permeability to albumin. After filtration, however, albumin binds to megalin and cubulin, two giant receptors in the apical membrane of proximal tubular cells. Albumin is subsequently re-absorbed by proximal tubular cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, a process subject to complex regulation. The interaction of albumin with proximal tubule cells also leads to the generation of intracellular signals. The understanding of these pathways may provide important insights into the pathogenesis of renal scarring in proteinuria.",,
10845107,Mechanisms of guanylin action via cyclic GMP in the kidney.,"Guanylin, uroguanylin, and lymphoguanylin are small peptides that activate cell-surface guanylate cyclase receptors and influence cellular function via intracellular cGMP. Guanylins activate two receptors, GC-C and OK-GC, which are expressed in intestine and/or kidney. Elevation of cGMP in the intestine elicits an increase in electrolyte and water secretion. Activation of renal receptors by uroguanylin stimulates urine flow and excretion of sodium, chloride, and potassium. Intracellular cGMP pathways for guanylins include activation of PKG-II and/or indirect stimulation of PKA-II. The result is activation of CFTR and/or C1C-2 channel proteins to enhance the electrogenic secretion of chloride and bicarbonate. Similar cellular mechanisms may be involved in the renal responses to guanylin peptides. Uroguanylin serves as an intestinal natriuretic hormone in postprandial states, thus linking the digestive and renal organ systems in a novel endocrine axis. Therefore, uroguanylin participates in the complex physiological processes underlying the saliuresis that is elicited by a salty meal.",Annual review of physiology,2000

Using various chemokines or defensins fused with nonimmunogenic tumor Ags, we studied their capacity to delivery Ags to subsets of immune cells to elicit antitumor immunity. We demonstrate that DNA immunizations with fusion constructs with beta-defensin 2 or inflammatory chemokines that target immature DC, but not homeostatic chemokines secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine, CCL21, or stromal cell-derived factor 1, CXCL12, which chemoattract mature DC, elicit humoral, protective, and therapeutic immunity against two different syngeneic lymphomas.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2001
9492085,Megalin (gp330): a putative endocytic receptor for thyroglobulin (Tg).,"Megalin (gp330) is a large glycoprotein receptor found mainly on a group of absorptive epithelial cells, including renal proximal tubule, epididymal and thyroid cells. Megalin has been shown to bind multiple, unrelated ligands, mainly in vitro, and to mediate endocytosis of ligandsin cultured cells. However, physiologic ligands of megalin are largely unknown. In the present study we have demonstrated that purified rat megalin binds rat thyroglobulin (Tg) in solid phase assays, with anestimated Kd of 9.2+/-0.6 nM. Binding was calcium dependent and was almost completely inhibited by excess Tg, by three megalin ligands - lactoferrin, lipoprotein lipase and apolipoprotein J- and by the receptor associated protein (RAP), which inhibits binding of all megalin ligands. Three anti-megalin antibodies partially inhibited Tg binding to megalin. 125I labeled Tg bound to megalin was released by EDTA and heparin; the released product was shown by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to be 660 kD (dimeric) Tg. However, an immunoblotting experiment showed binding of megalin both to monomeric (330 kD) and dimeric Tg. We propose that megalin, which is known to mediate ligand endocytosis and is found on the apical surface of thyrocytes, may participate in the endocytosis of Tg from the colloid, a process that is required for hormone release from Tg.",,
15467006,Megalin binds and internalizes angiotensin II.,"Megalin is an abundant membrane protein heavily involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. The major functions of megalin in vivo remain incompletely defined as megalin typically faces specialized milieus such as glomerular filtrate, airways, epididymal fluid, thyroid colloid, and yolk sac fluid, which lack many of its known ligands. In the course of studies on ANG II internalization, we were surprised when only part of the uptake of labeled ANG II into immortalized yolk sac cells (BN-16 cells) was blocked by specific peptide inhibitors and direct competitors of the angiotensin type 1 receptor. This led us to test if megalin was a receptor for ANG II. Four lines of direct evidence demonstrate that megalin and, to a lesser extent, its chaperone protein cubilin are receptors for ANG II. First, in BN-16 cells anti-megalin and anti-cubilin antisera interfere with ANG II uptake. Second, also in BN-16 cells, pure ANG II competes for uptake of a known megalin ligand. Third, in proximal tubule cell brush-border membrane vesicles extracted from mice, anti-megalin antisera interfere with ANG II binding. Fourth, purified megalin binds ANG II directly in surface plasmon resonance experiments. The finding that megalin is a receptor for ANG II suggests a major new function for the megalin pathway in vivo. These results also indicate that ANG II internalization in some tissues is megalin dependent and that megalin may play a role in regulating proximal tubule ANG II levels.",,
9773776,Megalin is an endocytic receptor for insulin.,"Renal clearance is a major pathway for regulating the levels of insulin and other low molecular weight polypeptide hormones in the systemic circulation. Previous studies have shown that the reabsorption of insulin from the glomerular filtrate occurs by binding to as yet unidentified sites on the luminal surface of proximal tubule cells followed by endocytosis and degradation in lysosomes. In this study, an insulin binding site was identified in renal microvillar membranes by chemical cross-linking procedures. By immunoprecipitation it was demonstrated that this binding site is megalin, the large multiligand binding endocytic receptor that is abundantly expressed in clathrin-coated pits on the apical surface of proximal tubule cells. Moreover, using cytochemical procedures, it was also shown that megalin is able to internalize insulin into endocytic vesicles. In ligand blotting assays, megalin also bound several other low molecular weight polypeptides, including beta2-microglobulin, epidermal growth factor, prolactin, lysozyme, and cytochrome c. These data suggest that megalin may play a significant role as a renal reabsorption receptor for the uptake of insulin and other low molecular weight polypeptides from the glomerular filtrate.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,1998
8898021,Megalin/gp330 mediates uptake of albumin in renal proximal tubule.,"Serum albumin filtered in renal glomeruli is reabsorbed very efficiently in the proximal tubule by endocytosis. The present study was undertaken to determine whether megalin/gp330 binds and mediates endocytosis of albumin. Rat serum albumin (RSA) labeled with 125I and colloidal gold particles labeled with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were microinfused into rat surface proximal tubules in vivo, and tubular uptake was determined in the presence or absence of different substances known to interfere with ligand binding to megalin. Binding of 125I-BSA and 125I-RSA to purified megalin was also determined directly using Sepharose columns. The results revealed that the tubular uptake of 125I-labeled RSA was significantly inhibited by receptor-associated protein (RAP), which reduced the uptake by > 50% and by cold RSA. The uptake of BSA gold by the proximal tubule was very intensive. BSA gold was found in small and large endocytic vacuoles, dense apical tubules, and in lysosomes. The uptake was reduced by RAP to 17%, by EDTA to 19%, by BSA to 16%, by megalin to 35%, by cytochrome c to 49%, and, together with gentamicin, there was virtually no uptake. Megalin-Sepharose columns bound 125I-labeled BSA as well as 125I-RSA, the binding was inhibited by RAP and EDTA, and analysis of the eluate revealed the bound tracer to be albumin. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that megalin is a mediator of albumin reabsorption in renal proximal tubules.",The American journal of physiology,1996
10421367,Melanin-concentrating hormone is the cognate ligand for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor SLC-1.,"The underlying causes of obesity are poorly understood but probably involve complex interactions between many neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems involved in the regulation of food intake and energy balance. Three pieces of evidence indicate that the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an important component of this system. First, MCH stimulates feeding when injected directly into rat brains; second, the messenger RNA for the MCH precursor is upregulated in the hypothalamus of genetically obese mice and in fasted animals; and third, mice lacking MCH eat less and are lean. MCH antagonists might, therefore, provide a treatment for obesity. However, the development of such molecules has been hampered because the identity of the MCH receptor has been unknown until now. Here we show that the 353-amino-acid human orphan G-protein-coupled receptor SLC-1 expressed in HEK293 cells binds MCH with sub-nanomolar affinity, and is stimulated by MCH to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and reduce forskolin-elevated cyclic AMP levels. We also show that SLC-1 messenger RNA and protein is expressed in the ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, consistent with a role for SLC-1 in mediating the effects of MCH on feeding.",,
10825303,"Meltrin gamma(ADAM-9) mediates cellular adhesion through alpha(6)beta(1 )integrin, leading to a marked induction of fibroblast cell motility.","The ADAMs (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease Domains) are a family of membrane-anchored proteins that play a role in fertilisation, myoblast fusion and ectodomain shedding of cell surface proteins. Meltrin gamma (ADAM-9) is a widely expressed member of this family and is involved in the shedding of heparin binding epidermal growth factor. Here we report that meltrin gamma can function as a cell adhesion molecule via its disintegrin domain. Using solid-phase binding assays and antibody inhibition experiments, we demonstrate that a murine meltrin gamma-Fc (Mel gamma -Fc) fusion protein binds to the integrin alpha(6)beta(1) on the surface of fibroblast cell lines, HT1080 and Wehi 164 in a specific manner. Since alpha(6)beta(1) is important for the motility of several cell types on laminin, cell migration studies using time-lapse video microscopy were performed. Cells adhering to Mel gamma-Fc displayed a rounded morphology and a marked increase (eight- to tenfold) in their motility compared to that on laminin. Furthermore, the p160 ROCK kinase inhibitor Y-27632 specifically reduced the migration of cells on meltrin gamma but had no effect on migration of cells on laminin, whilst the general tyrosine phoshorylation inhibitor, genistein, inhibited cell migration on both substrates. These results together suggest that meltrin gamma may play a role in regulating the motility of cells by binding to alpha(6)beta(1) integrin and this may be important during a variety of biological and pathological processes.",,
9603948,Met-195 of the cholecystokinin-A receptor interacts with the sulfated tyrosine of cholecystokinin and is crucial for receptor transition to high affinity state.,"Sulfation of the tyrosine at the seventh position from the C terminus of cholecystokinin (CCK) is crucial for CCK binding to the CCK-A receptor. Using three-dimensional modeling, we identified methionine 195 of the CCK-A receptor as a putative amino acid in interaction with the aromatic ring of the sulfated tyrosine of CCK. We analyzed the role played by the two partners of this interaction. The exchange of Met-195 for a leucine caused a minor decrease (2. 8-fold) on the affinity of the high affinity sites for sulfated CCK-9, a strong drop (73%) of their number, and a 30-fold decrease on the affinity of the low and very low affinity sites for sulfated CCK-9, with no change in their number. The mutation also caused a 54-fold decrease of the potency of the receptor to induce inositol phosphates production. The high affinity sites of the wild-type CCK-A receptor were highly selective (800-fold) toward sulfated versus nonsulfated CCK, whereas low and very low affinity sites were poorly selective (10- and 18-fold). In addition, the M195L mutant bound, and responded to, sulfated CCK analogues with decreased affinities and potencies, whereas it bound and responded to nonsulfated CCK identically to the wild-type receptor. Thus, Met-195 interacts with the aromatic ring of the sulfated tyrosine to correctly position the sulfated group of CCK in the binding site of the receptor. This interaction is essential for CCK-dependent transition of the CCK-A receptor to a high affinity state. Our data should represent an important step toward the identification of the residue(s) of the receptor in interaction with the sulfate moiety of CCK and the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern CCK-A receptor activation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
10608878,Metabolism of activated complement component C3 is mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha(2)-macroglobulin receptor.,"Complement component 3 (C3) and alpha(2)-macroglobulin evolved from a common, evolutionarily old, ancestor gene. Low density lipoprotein-receptor-related protein/alpha(2)-macroglobulin receptor (LRP/alpha(2)MR), a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, is responsible for the clearance of alpha(2)-macroglobulin-protease complexes. In this study, we examined whether C3 has conserved affinity for LRP/alpha(2)MR. Ligand blot experiments with human (125)I-C3 on endosomal proteins show binding to a 600-kDa protein, indistinguishable from LRP/alpha(2)MR by the following criteria: it is competed by receptor-associated protein (the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein that impairs binding of all ligands to LRP/alpha(2)MR) and by lactoferrin and Pseudomonas exotoxin, other well known ligands of the multifunctional receptor. Binding of C3 is sensitive to reduction of the receptor and is Ca(2+)-dependent. All these features are typical for cysteine-rich binding repeats of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. In LRP/alpha(2)MR, they are found in four cassettes (2, 8, 10, and 11 repeats). Ligand blotting to chicken LR8 demonstrates that a single 8-fold repeat is sufficient for binding. Confocal microscopy visualizes initial surface labeling of human fibroblasts incubated with fluorescent labeled C3, which changes after 5 min to an intracellular vesicular staining pattern that is abolished in the presence of receptor-associated protein. Cell uptake is abolished in mouse fibroblasts deficient in LRP/alpha(2)MR. Native plasma C3 is not internalized. We demonstrate that the capacity to internalize C3 is saturable and exhibits a K(D) value of 17 nM. After intravenous injection, rat hepatocytes accumulate C3 in sedimentable vesicles with a density typical for endosomes. In conclusion, our ligand blot and uptake studies demonstrate the competence of the LRP/alpha(2)MR to bind and endocytose C3 and provide evidence for an LRP/alpha(2)MR-mediated system participating in C3 metabolism.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999

We have recently shown that matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12) releases cellular uPAR-antigen from stimulated human micro-vascular endothelial cells providing a novel feedback mechanism between the plasminogen activation and MMP systems. We now show that MMP-12 and other MMPs directly and efficiently cleave uPAR at the Thr86 paralal Tyr87 peptide bond located in the linker region connecting uPAR domains 1 and 2, releasing the major ligand binding domain 1 from the rest of the receptor. The possible biological importance of uPAR cleavage by MMPs is supported by the observation that also murine uPAR is cleaved by MMP-12 (at the Pro89 paralal Gln90 peptide bond), despite the limited sequence homology between the linker regions. Using an antibody raised against the human uPAR linker region we show that this region of uPAR, which contains the chemotactic SRSRY epitope, is exposed upon MMP cleavage.",Thrombosis and haemostasis,2002
11385580,Metastasis suppressor gene KiSS-1 encodes peptide ligand of a G-protein-coupled receptor.,"Metastasis is a major cause of death in cancer patients and involves a multistep process including detachment of cancer cells from a primary cancer, invasion of surrounding tissue, spread through circulation, re-invasion and proliferation in distant organs. KiSS-1 is a human metastasis suppressor gene, that suppresses metastases of human melanomas and breast carcinomas without affecting tumorigenicity. However, its gene product and functional mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here we show that KiSS-1 (refs 1, 4) encodes a carboxy-terminally amidated peptide with 54 amino-acid residues, which we have isolated from human placenta as the endogenous ligand of an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (hOT7T175) and have named 'metastin'. Metastin inhibits chemotaxis and invasion of hOT7T175-transfected CHO cells in vitro and attenuates pulmonary metastasis of hOT7T175-transfected B16-BL6 melanomas in vivo. The results suggest possible mechanisms of action for KiSS-1 and a potential new therapeutic approach.",Nature,2001
24441829,Mfge8 promotes obesity by mediating the uptake of dietary fats and serum fatty acids.,"Fatty acids are integral mediators of energy storage, membrane formation and cell signaling. The pathways that orchestrate uptake of fatty acids remain incompletely understood. Expression of the integrin ligand Mfge8 is increased in human obesity and in mice on a high-fat diet, but its role in obesity is unknown. We show here that Mfge8 promotes the absorption of dietary triglycerides and the cellular uptake of fatty acid and that Mfge8-deficient (Mfge8(-/-)) mice are protected from diet-induced obesity, steatohepatitis and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, we found that Mfge8 coordinates fatty acid uptake through αvβ3 integrin- and αvβ5 integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Akt by phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase and mTOR complex 2, leading to translocation of Cd36 and Fatp1 from cytoplasmic vesicles to the cell surface. Collectively, our results imply a role for Mfge8 in regulating the absorption and storage of dietary fats, as well as in the development of obesity and its complications.",Nature medicine,2014

Combinations of MHC class I and KIR variants influence resistance to infections, susceptibility to autoimmune diseases and complications of pregnancy, as well as outcome after haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.

15265913,MHC class I-independent recognition of NK-activating receptor KIR2DS4.,"Natural killer cells are capable of killing tumor and virus-infected cells. This killing is mediated primarily via the natural cytotoxicity receptors, including NKp46, NKp44, NKp30, and by the NKG2D receptor. Killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) are mainly involved in inhibiting NK killing (inhibitory KIRs) via interaction with MHC class I molecules. Some KIRs, however, have been found to enhance NK killing when interacting with MHC class I molecules (activating KIRs). We have previously demonstrated that KIR2DS4, an activating KIR, recognizes the HLA-Cw4 protein. The interaction observed was weak and highly restricted to HLA-Cw4 only. These findings prompted us to check whether KIR2DS4 might have additional ligand(s). In this study, we show that KIR2DS4 is able to also interact with a non-class I MHC protein expressed on melanoma cell lines and on a primary melanoma. This interaction is shown to be both specific and functional. Importantly, site-directed mutagenesis analysis reveals that the amino acid residues involved in the recognition of this novel ligand are different from those interacting with HLA-Cw4. These results may shed new light on the function of activating KIRs and their relevance in NK biology.",,
20686071,"Microfibrils and fibrillin-1 induce integrin-mediated signaling, proliferation and migration in human endothelial cells.","Microfibrils are macromolecular complexes associated with elastin to form elastic fibers that endow extensible tissues, such as arteries, lungs, and skin, with elasticity property. Fibrillin-1, the main component of microfibrils, is a 350-kDa glycoprotein for which genetic haploinsufficiency in humans can lead to Marfan syndrome, a severe polyfeatured pathology including aortic aneurysms and dissections. Microfibrils and fibrillin-1 fragments mediate adhesion of several cell types, including endothelial cells, while fibrillin-1 additionally triggers lung and mesangial cell migration. However, fibrillin-1-induced intracellular signaling is unknown. We have studied the signaling events induced in human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) by aortic microfibrils as well as recombinant fibrillin-1 Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing fragments PF9 and PF14. Aortic microfibrils and PF14, not PF9, substantially and dose dependently increased HUVEC cytoplasmic and nuclear calcium levels measured using the fluorescent dye Fluo-3. This effect of PF14 was confirmed in bovine aortic endothelial cells. PF14 action in HUVECs was mediated by αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins, phospholipase-C, inosital 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and mobilization of intracellular calcium stores, whereas membrane calcium channels were not or only slightly implicated, as shown in patch-clamp experiments. Finally, PF14 enhanced endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Hence, fibrillin-1 sequences may physiologically activate endothelial cells. Genetic fibrillin-1 deficiency could alter normal endothelial signaling and, since endothelium dysfunction is an important contributor to Marfan syndrome, participate in the arterial anomalies associated with this developmental disease.",,
12122009,Midkine binds to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and acts as a growth factor for different cell types.,"Midkine (MK) is a developmentally regulated, secreted growth factor homologous to pleiotrophin (PTN). To investigate the potential role of MK in tumor growth, we expressed MK in human SW-13 cells and studied receptor binding, signal transduction, and activity of MK. The MK protein stimulates soft agar colony formation in vitro and tumor growth of SW-13 cells in athymic nude mice, as well as proliferation of human endothelial cells from brain microvasculature and umbilical vein (HUVEC) in the low ng/ml range. MK binds to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), the receptor for PTN, with an apparent K(d) of 170 pm in intact cells, and this receptor binding of MK is competed by PTN with an apparent K(d) of approximately 20 pm. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the extracellular ligand-binding domain of ALK inhibit ALK receptor binding of MK as well as MK-stimulated colony formation of SW-13 cells. Furthermore, MK stimulates ALK phosphorylation in WI-38 human fibroblasts and activates PI3-kinase and MAP kinase signal transduction in WI-38, HUVEC, neuroblastoma (SH SY-5Y) and glioblastoma (U87MG) cells that express the ALK protein. We conclude that MK can act as a growth, survival, and angiogenic factor during tumorigenesis and signals through the ALK receptor.",,
18469519,Midkine induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition through Notch2/Jak2-Stat3 signaling in human keratinocytes.,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) underlies cell plasticity and embryonic development and is frequently observed in advanced tumorigenesis. We demonstrated that midkine (MK), a retinoic acid-inducible heparin-binding mitogen, promotes EMT in immortalized HaCaT keratinocytes. We showed that MK binds to the Notch2 receptor in HaCaT keratinocytes. We further found that MK activates Notch2 signaling leading to protein/protein interactions between Hes1 and Jak2/Stat3 intermediates. We thus suggest that MK-induced cross talk of Notch2/Jak2/Stat3 signaling pathways can regulate cell plasticity and motility contributing to the EMT and later stages of tumorigenesis.","Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",2008
18851943,Midkine promotes tetraspanin-integrin interaction and induces FAK-Stat1alpha pathway contributing to migration/invasiveness of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells.,"The heparin-binding growth factor, MK, promoting tumorigenesis and survival was found to associate with alpha6beta1 integrins. We showed for the first time that MK interacted with TSPAN1 and facilitated the association between TSPAN1 and integrin alpha6beta1 proteins in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. We found that MK mediated an integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and activation of paxillin and Stat1alpha pathways. As result, downstream target genes implicated in cell migration and invasiveness (e.g. MMP-2 and MMP-26) were overexpressed. We observed that RNAi silencing of the critical signaling intermediates led to decrease of MK-induced migration/invasiveness of HNSCC cells. The major finding of this study is a novel MK-triggered signaling mechanism implicated in migration and invasiveness of HNSCC cells.",,
17435771,MIF is a noncognate ligand of CXC chemokine receptors in inflammatory and atherogenic cell recruitment.,"The cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) plays a critical role in inflammatory diseases and atherogenesis. We identify the chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4 as functional receptors for MIF. MIF triggered G(alphai)- and integrin-dependent arrest and chemotaxis of monocytes and T cells, rapid integrin activation and calcium influx through CXCR2 or CXCR4. MIF competed with cognate ligands for CXCR4 and CXCR2 binding, and directly bound to CXCR2. CXCR2 and CD74 formed a receptor complex, and monocyte arrest elicited by MIF in inflamed or atherosclerotic arteries involved both CXCR2 and CD74. In vivo, Mif deficiency impaired monocyte adhesion to the arterial wall in atherosclerosis-prone mice, and MIF-induced leukocyte recruitment required Il8rb (which encodes Cxcr2). Blockade of Mif but not of canonical ligands of Cxcr2 or Cxcr4 in mice with advanced atherosclerosis led to plaque regression and reduced monocyte and T-cell content in plaques. By activating both CXCR2 and CXCR4, MIF displays chemokine-like functions and acts as a major regulator of inflammatory cell recruitment and atherogenesis. Targeting MIF in individuals with manifest atherosclerosis can potentially be used to treat this condition.",Nature medicine,2007
12782713,MIF signal transduction initiated by binding to CD74.,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) accounts for one of the first cytokine activities to have been described, and it has emerged recently to be an important regulator of innate and adaptive immunity. MIF is an upstream activator of monocytes/macrophages, and it is centrally involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock, arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions. The protein is encoded by a unique but highly conserved gene, and X-ray crystallography studies have shown MIF to define a new protein fold and structural superfamily. Although recent work has begun to illuminate the signal transduction pathways activated by MIF, the nature of its membrane receptor has not been known. Using expression cloning and functional analysis, we report herein that CD74, a Type II transmembrane protein, is a high-affinity binding protein for MIF. MIF binds to the extracellular domain of CD74, and CD74 is required for MIF-induced activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 MAP kinase cascade, cell proliferation, and PGE2 production. A recombinant, soluble form of CD74 binds MIF with a dissociation constant of approximately 9 x 10-9 Kd, as defined by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore analysis), and soluble CD74 inhibits MIF-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in defined cell systems. These data provide a molecular basis for MIF's interaction with target cells and identify it as a natural ligand for CD74, which has been implicated previously in signaling and accessory functions for immune cell activation.",,
16421945,Migration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes toward melanoma cells in three-dimensional organotypic culture is dependent on CCL2 and CCR4.,"Studies in experimental animal models have demonstrated that chemokines produced by tumor cells attract chemokine receptor-positive T lymphocytes into the tumor area. However, in cancer patients, the role of chemokines in T lymphocyte trafficking toward human tumor cells is relatively unexplored. In the present study, the migration of a melanoma patient's CTL toward autologous tumor cells has been studied in a novel three-dimensional organotypic melanoma culture. In this model, CTL migrated toward tumor cells, resulting in tumor cell apoptosis. CTL migration was mediated by the CC chemokine receptor (CCR)4 expressed by the CTL and the CC chemokine ligand (CCL)2 secreted by the tumor cells, as evidenced by blockage of CTL migration by CCL2 or antibodies to CCL2 or CCR4. These results were confirmed in a Transwell migration assay in which the CTL actively migrated toward isolated CCL2 and migration was inhibited by anti-CCR4 antibody. These studies, together with previous studies in mice indicating regression of CCL2-transduced tumor cells, suggest that CCL2 may be useful as an immunotherapeutic agent for cancer patients.",,
25799045,Migration of myeloid cells during inflammation is differentially regulated by the cell surface receptors Slamf1 and Slamf8.,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the cell surface receptor Slamf1 (CD150) is requisite for optimal NADPH-oxidase (Nox2) dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by phagocytes in response to Gram- bacteria. By contrast, Slamf8 (CD353) is a negative regulator of ROS in response to Gram+ and Gram- bacteria. Employing in vivo migration after skin sensitization, induction of peritonitis, and repopulation of the small intestine demonstrates that in vivo migration of Slamf1-/- dendritic cells and macrophages is reduced, as compared to wt mice. By contrast, in vivo migration of Slamf8-/- dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils is accelerated. These opposing effects of Slamf1 and Slamf8 are cell-intrinsic as judged by in vitro migration in transwell chambers in response to CCL19, CCL21 or CSF-1. Importantly, inhibiting ROS production of Slamf8-/- macrophages by diphenyleneiodonium chloride blocks this in vitro migration. We conclude that Slamf1 and Slamf8 govern ROS-dependent innate immune responses of myeloid cells, thus modulating migration of these cells during inflammation in an opposing manner.",,
8901523,Mirror image motifs mediate the interaction of the COOH terminus of multiple synaptotagmins with the neurexins and calmodulin.,"I have previously reported that the COOH-terminal 34 amino acids of synaptotagmin 1 are capable of interacting with the presynaptic proteins, the neurexins. Multiple synaptotagmins and a synaptotagmin-like protein, rabphilin 3A, are conserved in this domain, raising the possibility that many different synaptotagmins may interact with neurexins. Here 1 report that the COOH termini of synaptotagmins 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 and rabphilin 3A are capable of interacting with neurexins. The COOH terminus of rabphilin 3A is still capable or substantial enrichment of neurexins from solubilized brain membranes even though only 11 of 33 residues are identical with the COOH terminus of synaptotagmin 1. Like the purification of neurexins on the COOH terminus of synaptotagmin 1, purification by the COOH terminus of rabphilin 3A is calcium-independent. The conservation between carboxyl termini of these proteins suggests symmetrical motifs are necessary for neurexin binding. These include the sequence Leu-X-His-Trp, followed by 13 amino acids, and the sequence Trp-His-X-Lcu. Deletion of the first motif or substitution of residues in the second of these motifs greatly reduces neurexin enrichment. Interestingly, these same COOH termini yield substantial calcium-dependent enrichment of calmodulin mediated by the first of these sequence motifs. This correlates with the binding of 125I-labeled calmodulin by recombinant pieces of synaptotagmn 1 containing the carboxyl terminus. These data suggest that multiple synaptotagmins may interact with neurexins to mediate docking or regulation of neurotransmitter release and that synaptotagmins may be calcium-regulated via interaction with calmodulin.",,
11106601,Modeling zymogen protein C.,"A solution structure for the complete zymogen form of human coagulation protein C is modeled. The initial core structure is based on the x-ray crystallographic structure of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-domainless activated form. The Gla domain (residues 1-48) is modeled from the x-ray crystal coordinates of the factor VII(a)/tissue factor complex and oriented with the epidermal growth factor-1 domain to yield an initial orientation consistent with the x-ray crystal structure of porcine factor IX(a). The missing C-terminal residues in the light chain (residues 147-157) and the activation peptide residues 158-169 were introduced using homology modeling so that the activation peptide residues directly interact with the residues in the calcium binding loop. Molecular dynamics simulations (Amber-particle-mesh-Ewald) are used to obtain the complete calcium-complexed solution structure. The individual domain structures of protein C in solution are largely unaffected by solvation, whereas the Gla-epidermal growth factor-1 orientation evolves to a form different from both factors VII(a) and IX(a). The solution structure of the zymogen protein C is compared with the crystal structures of the existing zymogen serine proteases: chymotrypsinogen, proproteinase, and prethrombin-2. Calculated electrostatic potential surfaces support the involvement of the serine protease calcium ion binding loop in providing a suitable electrostatic environment around the scissile bond for II(a)/thrombomodulin interaction.",,
10725346,Modification of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 with a natural killer cell-restricted sulfated lactosamine creates an alternate ligand for L-selectin.,"Natural killer (NK) cells are components of the innate immune system that can recognize and kill virally infected cells, tumor cells, and allogeneic cells without prior sensitization. NK cells also elaborate cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and chemokines (e.g., macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha) that promote the acquisition of antigen-specific immunity. NK cell differentiation is accompanied by the cell surface expression of a mucin-like glycoprotein bearing an NK cell-restricted keratan sulfate-related lactosamine carbohydrate, the PEN5 epitope. Here, we report that PEN5 is a post-translational modification of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). The PEN5 epitope creates on PSGL-1 a unique binding site for L-selectin, which is independent of PSGL-1 tyrosine sulfation. On the surface of NK cells, the expression of PEN5 is coordinated with the disappearance of L-selectin and the up-regulation of Killer cell Ig-like Receptors (KIR). These results indicate that NK cell differentiation is accompanied by the acquisition of a unique carbohydrate, PEN5, that can serve as part of a combination code to deliver KIR(+) NK cells to specific tissues.",,
11266516,Modulation of activin signal transduction by inhibin B and inhibin-binding protein (INhBP).,"An antagonistic relationship between inhibin and activin is essential to the control of pituitary FSH release and to normal gonadal function. Two inhibin ligands, inhibin A and inhibin B, are made by the ovary in females, and each regulate pituitary FSH at different times during the reproductive cycle. Inhibin B, but not inhibin A, is produced by the testes and is therefore responsible for all inhibin-dependent FSH regulation in males. Although the activin signal transduction pathway has been well characterized, little is known about the mechanism of inhibin signaling and its relationship to activin antagonism. A recently cloned inhibin-binding protein, InhBP (p120), associates strongly with the type IB activin receptor (Alk4) in a ligand-responsive manner and interacts to a lesser extent with other activin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I and activin type II receptors. Activin stimulates the association of InhBP and Alk4, and inhibin B, but not inhibin A, interferes with InhBP-Alk4 complex formation. InhBP is necessary to mediate a specific antagonistic effect of inhibin B on activin-stimulated transcription. Appropriate stoichiometry between InhBP and the activin type I receptor is crucial to InhBP function. These findings suggest that InhBP is an inhibin B-specific receptor that mediates antagonism of activin signal transduction through the modulation of activin heteromeric receptor complex assembly.",,
11994433,Modulation of dendritic cell differentiation and maturation by decoy receptor 3.,"Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), a soluble receptor belonging to the TNFR superfamily, is a receptor for both Fas ligand (FasL) and LIGHT. It has been demonstrated that DcR3 is up-regulated in lung and colon cancers, thus promoting tumor growth by neutralizing the cytotoxic effects of FasL and LIGHT. In this study, we found that DcR3.Fc profoundly modulated dendritic cell differentiation and maturation from CD14(+) monocytes, including the up-regulation of CD86/B7.2, and the down-regulation of CD40, CD54/ICAM-1, CD80/B7.1, CD1a, and HLA-DR. Moreover, DcR3-treated dendritic cells suppressed CD4(+) T cell proliferation in an allogeneic MLR and up-regulated IL-4 secretion of CD4(+)CD45RA(+) T cells. This suggests that DcR3.Fc may act not only as a decoy receptor to FasL and LIGHT, but also as an effector molecule to skew T cell response to the Th2 phenotype.",,
20876211,"Modulation of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis: a novel function for the ""tandem-repeat"" lectin galectin-8.","Angiogenesis, the growth of new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels, is a complex process involving endothelial cell (EC) activation, disruption of vascular basement membranes, and migration and proliferation of ECs. Glycan-mediated recognition has been proposed to play an instrumental role in mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Galectins (Gal), a family of glycan-binding proteins with affinity for β-galactosides and a conserved sequence motif, can decipher glycan-containing information and mediate cell-cell communication. Galectin-8 (Gal-8), a member of this family, is a bivalent ""tandem-repeat""-type galectin, which possesses 2 CRDs connected by a linker peptide. Here, we show that Gal-8 is endowed with proangiogeneic properties. Functional assays revealed a critical role for this lectin in the regulation of capillary-tube formation and EC migration. Moreover, Matrigel, either supplemented with Gal-8 or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), injected in mice resulted in induction of in vivo angiogenesis. Remarkably, Gal-8 was expressed both in the cytoplasm and nucleus in ECs of normal and tumor vessels. Furthermore, CD166 [activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM)] was identified as a specific Gal-8-binding partner in normal vascular ECs. Collectively, these data provide the first evidence demonstrating an essential role for Gal-8 in the regulation of angiogenesis with critical implications in tumor biology.",,
15569154,Modulation of GDF5/BRI-b signalling through interaction with the tyrosine kinase receptor Ror2.,"The brachydactylies are a group of inherited disorders of the hands characterized by shortened digits. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor Ror2 cause brachydactyly type B (BDB). Mutations in GDF5, a member of the BMP/TGF-beta ligand family, cause brachydactyly type C (BDC) whereas mutations in the receptor for GDF5, BRI-b, cause brachydactyly type A2 (BDA2). There is considerable degree of phenotypic overlap between the subtypes BDB, BDC and BDA2. Here we demonstrate that all three components are involved in GDF5 induced regulation of chondrogenesis. We show that Ror2 (tyrosine kinase receptor) and BRI-b (serine/threonine kinase receptor) form a ligand independent heteromeric complex. The frizzled-like-CRD domain of Ror2 is required for this complex. Within that complex Ror2 gets transphosphorylated by BRI-b. We show that Ror2 modulates GDF5 signalling by inhibition of Smad1/5 signalling and by activating a Smad-independent pathway. Both pathways however, are needed for chondrogenic differentiation as demonstrated in ATDC5 cells. The functional interaction of Ror2 with GDF5 and BRI-b was genetically confirmed by the presence of epistatic effects in crosses of Ror2, BRI-b and Gdf5 deficient mice. These results indicate for the first time a direct interaction of Ser/Thr- and Tyr-Kinase receptors and provide evidence for modulation of the Smad-pathway and GDF5 triggered chondrogenesis.",,
15163697,"Modulation of ion channels and synaptic transmission by a human sensory neuron-specific G-protein-coupled receptor, SNSR4/mrgX1, heterologously expressed in cultured rat neurons.","Human sensory neuron-specific G-protein-coupled receptors (SNSRs) are expressed solely in small diameter primary sensory neurons. This restricted expression pattern is of considerable therapeutic interest because small nociceptors transmit chronic pain messages. The neuronal function of human SNSRs is difficult to assess because rodent orthologs have yet to be clearly defined, and individual isoforms are found only in a small subset of primary sensory neurons. To circumvent this problem, we expressed human SNSR4 (hSNSR4; also known as Hs.mrgX1) in rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG), dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and hippocampal neurons using nuclear injection or recombinant adenoviruses and examined modulation of ion channels and neurotransmission using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. BAM8-22 (a 15 amino acid C-terminal fragment of bovine adrenal medulla peptide 22), a peptide agonist derived from proenkephalin, inhibited high (but not low) voltage-activated Ca2+ current in both DRG and SCG neurons expressing hSNSR4, whereas no response was detected in control neurons. The Ca2+ current inhibition was concentration dependent and partially sensitive to Pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment. Additionally, the peptide was highly effective in modulating current arising from M-type K+ channels in SCG neurons expressing hSNSR4. In hippocampal neurons expressing hSNSR4, BAM8-22 induced presynaptic inhibition of transmission that was abolished after PTX treatment. Our data indicate that hSNSR4, when heterologously expressed in rat neurons, can be activated by an opioid-related peptide, couples to G(q/11)-proteins as well as PTX-sensitive G(i/o)-proteins, and modulates neuronal Ca2+ channels, K+ channels, and synaptic transmission.",,
24223577,Modulation of NK cell function by genetically coupled C-type lectin-like receptor/ligand pairs encoded in the human natural killer gene complex.,"Functional responses of natural killer (NK) cells including eradication of ""harmful"" cells and modulation of immune responses are regulated by a broad variety of activating and inhibitory NK receptors. Whereas the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) encodes for NK receptors of the immunoglobulin superfamily, genes of C-type lectin-like NK receptors are clustered in the mammalian natural killer gene complex (NKC). Besides the thoroughly studied C-type lectin-like receptors NKG2D, CD94/NKG2x, and members of the murine Ly49 subfamily, the NKC also encodes for NK receptors of the less characterized NKRP1 subfamily. The prototypic mouse NKRP1 receptor is Nkrp1c (also known as NK1.1), while human members of the NKRP1 subfamily are NKRP1A, NKp80, and NKp65. The latter are not straight homologs of mouse NKRP1 receptors, but share distinct subfamily-specific traits classifying them as members of the NKRP1 subfamily. Ligands of the human NKPR1 receptors are likewise C-type lectin-like glycoproteins belonging to the CLEC2 subfamily (i.e., LLT1, AICL, and KACL), and are encoded in the NKC in tight genetic linkage to their respective receptors. Similarly, certain members of the mouse NKRP1 subfamily interact with genetically coupled CLEC2 glycoproteins, while the reasons for this intriguing tight genetic linkage remain unknown. Recent studies provided new and unique insights into the expression, interaction, and signaling of NKRP1 receptors and their ligands, thereby substantially advancing our understanding of their function and biology. Here, we review our current knowledge on NKRP1 receptors and their genetically linked CLEC2 ligands with an emphasis on the human receptor/ligand pairs NKRP1A-LLT1, NKp80-AICL, and NKp65-KACL.",,
18182388,Modulation of Notch signaling by antibodies specific for the extracellular negative regulatory region of NOTCH3.,"The Notch pathway regulates the development of many tissues and cell types and is involved in a variety of human diseases, making it an attractive potential therapeutic target. This promise has been limited by the absence of potent inhibitors or agonists that are specific for individual human Notch receptors (NOTCH1-4). Using an unbiased functional screening, we identified monoclonal antibodies that specifically inhibit or induce activating proteolytic cleavages in NOTCH3. Remarkably, the most potent inhibitory and activating antibodies bind to overlapping epitopes within a juxtamembrane negative regulatory region that protects NOTCH3 from proteolysis and activation in its resting autoinhibited state. The inhibitory antibodies revert phenotypes conveyed on 293T cells by NOTCH3 signaling, such as increased cellular proliferation, survival, and motility, whereas the activating antibody mimics some of the effects of ligand-induced Notch activation. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of Notch autoinhibition and activation and pave the way for the further development of specific antibody-based modulators of the Notch receptors, which are likely to be of utility in a wide range of experimental and therapeutic settings.",,
11390428,Modulation of T-cell responses to alloantigens by TR6/DcR3.,"TR6 (DcR3) is a new member of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family that lacks a transmembrane domain in its sequence, indicating that it is a secreted molecule. TR6 can bind to FasL and prevent FasL-induced apoptosis; it can also associate with LIGHT, another TNF family member. The role of TR6 in immune responses was investigated in this study. According to flow cytometry, recombinant human TR6-Fc binds to human LIGHT expressed on 293 cells or on activated human T cells and competes with the LIGHT receptor TR2 for the binding to LIGHT on these cells. Human TR6 could cross-react with mouse LIGHT in immunoprecipitation. TR6-Fc also downregulates cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in vitro and graft-versus-host responses in mice. Moreover, TR6-Fc modulates lymphokine production by alloantigen-stimulated mouse T cells. TR6-Fc ameliorated rejection response to mouse heart allograft. These results indicate that TR6 can dampen T-cell responses to alloantigens. Such regulatory effects of TR6 probably occur via interference with interaction between pairs of related TNF and TNFR family members, LIGHT/TR2 being one of the possible candidate pairs.",,
12611880,"Molecular analysis of collagen binding by the human discoidin domain receptors, DDR1 and DDR2. Identification of collagen binding sites in DDR2.","The widely expressed mammalian discoidin domain receptors (DDRs), DDR1 and DDR2, are unique among receptor tyrosine kinases in that they are activated by the extracellular matrix protein collagen. Various collagen types bind to and activate the DDRs, but the molecular details of collagen recognition have not been well defined. In this study, recombinant extracellular domains of DDR1 and DDR2 were produced to explore DDR-collagen binding in detail. In solid phase assays, both DDRs bound collagen I with high affinity. DDR1 recognized collagen I only as a dimeric and not as a monomeric construct, indicating a requirement for receptor dimerization in the DDR1-collagen interaction. The DDRs contain a discoidin homology domain in their extracellular domains, and the isolated discoidin domain of DDR2 bound collagen I with high affinity. Furthermore, the discoidin domain of DDR2, but not of DDR1, was sufficient for transmembrane receptor signaling. To map the collagen binding site within the discoidin domain of DDR2, mutant constructs were created, in which potential surface-exposed loops in DDR2 were exchanged for the corresponding loops of functionally unrelated discoidin domains. Three spatially adjacent surface loops within the DDR2 discoidin domain were found to be critically involved in collagen binding of the isolated DDR2 extracellular domain. In addition, the same loops were required for collagen-dependent receptor activation. It is concluded that the loop region opposite to the polypeptide chain termini of the DDR2 discoidin domain constitutes the collagen recognition site.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
11700073,"Molecular anatomy of CCR5 engagement by physiologic and viral chemokines and HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins: differences in primary structural requirements for RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and vMIP-II Binding.","Molecular analysis of CCR5, the cardinal coreceptor for HIV-1 infection, has implicated the N-terminal extracellular domain (N-ter) and regions vicinal to the second extracellular loop (ECL2) in this activity. It was shown that residues in the N-ter are necessary for binding of the physiologic ligands, RANTES (CCL5) and MIP-1 alpha (CCL3). vMIP-II, encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, is a high affinity CCR5 antagonist, but lacks efficacy as a coreceptor inhibitor. Therefore, we compared the mechanism for engagement by vMIP-II of CCR5 to its interaction with physiologic ligands. RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and vMIP-II bound CCR5 at high affinity, but demonstrated partial cross-competition. Characterization of 15 CCR5 alanine scanning mutants of charged extracellular amino acids revealed that alteration of acidic residues in the distal N-ter abrogated binding of RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and vMIP-II. Whereas mutation of residues in ECL2 of CCR5 dramatically reduced the binding of RANTES and MIP-1 alpha and their ability to induce signaling, interaction with vMIP-II was not altered by any mutation in the exoloops of the receptor. Paradoxically, monoclonal antibodies to N-ter epitopes did not block chemokine binding, but those mapped to ECL2 were effective inhibitors. A CCR5 chimera with the distal N-ter residues of CXCR2 bound MIP-1 alpha and vMIP-II with an affinity similar to that of the wild-type receptor. Engagement of CCR5 by vMIP-II, but not RANTES or MIP-1 alpha blocked the binding of monoclonal antibodies to the receptor, providing additional evidence for a distinct mechanism for viral chemokine binding. Analysis of the coreceptor activity of randomly generated mouse-human CCR5 chimeras implicated residues in ECL2 between H173 and V197 in this function. RANTES, but not vMIP-II blocked CCR5 M-tropic coreceptor activity in the fusion assay. The insensitivity of vMIP-II binding to mutations in ECL2 provides a potential rationale to its inefficiency as an antagonist of CCR5 coreceptor activity. These findings suggest that the molecular anatomy of CCR5 binding plays a critical role in antagonism of coreceptor activity.",Journal of molecular biology,2001
1374165,Molecular and biological characterization of a murine ligand for CD40.,"The CD40 surface molecule is a 277-amino-acid glycoprotein expressed on B lymphocytes, epithelial cells and some carcinoma cell lines. Monoclonal antibodies against CD40 mediate a variety of effects on B lymphocytes, including induction of intercellular adhesion, short- and long-term proliferation, differentiation and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins. In addition, germinal centre centrocytes are prevented from undergoing apoptosis by activation through CD40 and receptor for antigen. These data indicate that CD40 could be a receptor for an unknown ligand with important functions in B-cell development and activation. This hypothesis is strengthened by the homology of the extracellular region of the CD40 molecule with a family of cell-surface glycoproteins that includes the receptors for nerve growth factor and tumour necrosis factor. Here we report the cloning of a ligand for CD40 that is expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells and mediates B-cell proliferation in the absence of co-stimulus, as well as IgE production in the presence of interleukin-4.",,
8088337,Molecular and biological characterization of human 4-1BB and its ligand.,"4-1BB was originally described as a cDNA expressed by activated murine T cells and subsequently demonstrated to encode a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family of integral membrane proteins. Recently, we identified and cloned a murine ligand for 4-1BB (mu4-1BB-L) and demonstrated it to be a member of an emerging family of ligands with structural homology to tumor necrosis factor. To characterize further the role of 4-1BB in the immune response we undertook to clone the human homologue of 4-1BB-L. However, attempts to isolate a cDNA encoding the human 4-1BB-L by cross-hybridization with the murine cDNA were unsuccessful. Therefore we first utilized cross-species hybridization to isolate a cDNA encoding human 4-1BB (hu4-1BB). A fusion protein consisting of the extracellular portion of hu4-1BB coupled to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 (hu4-1BB.Fc) was then used to identify and clone a gene for human 4-1BB-L from an activated CD4+ T cell clone using a direct expression cloning strategy. Human 4-1BB-L shows 36% amino acid identity with its murine counterpart and maps to chromosome 19p13.3. Scatchard analysis demonstrated high-affinity binding of hu4-1BB.Fc to either native or recombinant human 4-1BB-L. Both monoclonal antibody to hu4-1BB and cells transfected with hu4-1BB-L induced a strong proliferative response in mitogen co-stimulated primary T cells. In contrast, ligation of 4-1BB on T cell clones enhanced activation-induced cell death when triggered by engagement of the TCR/CD3 complex.",European journal of immunology,1994

10777510,Molecular and functional characteristics of APJ. Tissue distribution of mRNA and interaction with the endogenous ligand apelin.,"We have recently identified apelin as the endogenous ligand for human APJ. In rats, the highest expression of APJ mRNA was detected in the lung, suggesting that APJ and its ligand play an important role in the pulmonary system. When apelin-36 and its pyroglutamylated C-terminal peptide, [<Glu(65)]apelin-13, were compared in microphysiometric analyses, the elevation of extracellular acidification induced in cells expressing APJ by [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 was transient, whereas that by apelin-36 was sustained. These responses were almost completely inhibited by a specific inhibitor for G(i) or that for Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. (125)I -Labeled [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 analogue specifically bound to APJ with a high affinity, and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 was more potent than apelin-36 in competitive inhibition assays. Because pretreatment with apelin-36 but not [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 drastically reduced the binding of the labeled apelin to APJ, the different patterns of acidification induced by these two peptides appeared to reflect their dissociation rather than association with APJ. Apelin elicited the migration of APJ-expressing cells, and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 was more potent than apelin-36 in this activity. Heterogeneous molecular forms of apelin corresponding to apelin-36 and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 were produced in bovine colostrum. Apelin-36 and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 might have different functions in vivo and in vitro.",,
15368295,Molecular and functional characterization of a CS1 (CRACC) splice variant expressed in human NK cells that does not contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs.,"CS1 (CRACC, novel Ly9) is a novel member of the CD2 family expressed on natural killer (NK), T and stimulated B cells. Although the cytoplasmic domain of CS1 contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSM), which enables to recruite signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP/SH2D1A), it activates NK cells in the absence of a functional SAP. CS1 is a self ligand and homophilic interaction of CS1 regulates NK cell cytolytic activity. Here we have identified a novel splice variant of CS1 (CS1-S), which lacks ITSM. Human NK cells express mRNA for both wild-type CS1 (CS1-L) and CS1-S and their expression level remained steady upon various stimulations. To determine the function of each isoform, cDNA for CS1-L and CS1-S were transfected into the rat NK cell line RNK-16 and functionally tested using redirected cytotoxicity assays and calcium flux experiments. CS1-L was able to mediate redirected cytotoxicity of P815 target cells in the presence of monoclonal antibody against CS1 and a rise in intracellular calcium within RNK-16 cells, suggesting that CS1-L is an activating receptor, whereas CS1-S showed no effects. Interestingly, SAP associated with unstimulated CS1-L and dissociated upon pervanadate stimulation. These results indicate that CS1-L and CS1-S may differentially regulate human NK cell functions.",,
8167568,Molecular and functional characterization of activin receptors.,"Activins are multifunctional proteins with effects on a broad spectrum of cells and tissues. They are structurally related to a large family of growth and differentiation factors that includes the inhibins, the transforming growth factors b (TGFb), the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), Mullerian inhibitory substance, and a number of gene products that control the development of Drosophila and Xenopus. Although the cellular signaling mechanisms of these factors remain unclear, cDNAs encoding cell surface receptors for activin have been cloned. Those receptors are transmembrane serine kinases, suggesting a novel form of signaling. Overexpression of activin receptors in Xenopus embryos indicates that these molecules are functionally involved in the transmission of the activin signal.",,
11976263,Molecular and pharmacological characterization of genes encoding urotensin-II peptides and their cognate G-protein-coupled receptors from the mouse and monkey.,"Urotensin-II (U-II) and its receptor (UT) represent novel therapeutic targets for management of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. To test such hypothesis, it will be necessary to develop experimental animal models for the manipulation of U-II/UT receptor system. The goal of this study was to clone mouse and primate preproU-II and UT for pharmacological profiling. Monkey and mouse preproU-II genes were identified to encode 123 and 125 amino acids. Monkey and mouse UT receptors were 389, and 386 amino acids, respectively. Genomic organization of mouse genes showed that the preproU-II has four exons, while the UT receptor has one exon. Although initially viewed by many exclusively as cardiovascular targets, the present study demonstrates expression of mouse and monkey U-II/UT receptor mRNA in extra-vascular tissue including lung, pancreas, skeletal muscle, kidney and liver. Ligand binding studies showed that [125I]h U-II bound to a single sites to the cloned receptors in a saturable/high affinity manner (Kd 654+/-154 and 214+/-65 pM and Bmax of 1011+/-125 and 497+/-68 fmol mg-1 for mouse and monkey UT receptors, respectively). Competition binding analysis demonstrated equipotent, high affinity binding of numerous mammalian, amphibian and piscine U-II isopeptides to these receptors (Ki=0.8 - 3 nM). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled U-II, bound specifically to HEK-293 cells expressing mouse or monkey UT receptor, confirming cell surface expression of recombinant UT receptor. Exposure of these cells to human U-II resulted in an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] concentrations (EC50 3.2+/-0.8 and 1.1+/-0.3 nM for mouse and monkey UT receptors, respectively) and inositol phosphate (Ip) formation (EC50 7.2+/-1.8 and 0.9+/-0.2 nM for mouse and monkey UT receptors, respectively) consistent with the primary signalling pathway for UT receptor involving phospholipase C activation.",British journal of pharmacology,2002
11226387,Molecular and pharmacological characterization of the murine tachykinin NK(3) receptor.,"Starting with a partial sequence from Genbank, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to isolate the full-length cDNA for NK(3) receptor from mouse brain. The murine NK(3) receptor has a predicted sequence of 452 amino acids, sharing 96% and 86% identity to the rat and human NK(3) receptors, respectively. Binding affinities and functional potencies of tachykinin receptor agonists were similar in HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293 cells expressing murine NK(3) receptor and human NK(3) receptor, although substance P and neurokinin A were more potent stimulators of Ca(2+) mobilization in murine NK(3) receptor cells. NK(3) receptor-selective antagonists from two structural classes, had 10- to 100-fold lower binding affinities for murine NK(3) receptor compared to human NK(3) receptor, and about 5- to 10-fold reduced potency in the murine NK(3) receptor functional assay. The results demonstrate species differences in the potencies of tachykinin receptor antagonists in murine and human NK(3) receptors, and the lower potencies in the former should be taken into consideration when using murine disease models.",European journal of pharmacology,2001
21959263,Molecular basis for herpesvirus entry mediator recognition by the human immune inhibitory receptor CD160 and its relationship to the cosignaling molecules BTLA and LIGHT.,"CD160 was recently identified as a T cell coinhibitory molecule that interacts with the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) on antigen-presenting cells to deliver a potent inhibitory signal to CD4(+) T cells. HVEM also binds to the coinhibitory receptor BTLA (B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator) and the costimulatory receptor LIGHT (which is homologous to lymphotoxins, exhibits inducible expression, and competes with the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D for HVEM, a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes, or TNFSF14), thus regulating the CD160/BTLA/LIGHT/HVEM signaling pathway. To date, the detailed properties of the formation of these complexes, especially HVEM binding to the newly identified receptor CD160, and the relationship of CD160 with BTLA and LIGHT are still unclear. We performed N-terminal sequencing and a mass spectrometric analysis, which revealed that the extracellular domain of CD160 exists primarily in the monomeric form. The surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that CD160 binds directly to the cysteine-rich domain 1-3 of HVEM with a similar affinity to, but slower dissociation rate than, that of BTLA. Notably, CD160 competed with BTLA for binding to HVEM; in contrast, LIGHT did not affect HVEM binding to either CD160 or BTLA. The results of a mutagenesis study of HVEM also suggest that the CD160 binding region on HVEM was slightly different from, but overlapped with, the BTLA binding site. Interestingly, an anti-CD160 antibody exhibiting antiangiogenic properties blocked CD160/HVEM binding. These results provide insight into the molecular architecture of the CD160/BTLA/LIGHT/HVEM signaling complex that regulates immune function.",Journal of molecular biology,2011
12419820,Molecular basis of bone morphogenetic protein-15 signaling in granulosa cells.,"Bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP-15), an oocyte growth factor belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, has recently been shown to be necessary for normal female fertility in mammals. We have previously demonstrated that BMP-15 regulates granulosa cell (GC) proliferation and differentiation; namely, BMP-15 promotes GC mitosis, suppresses follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor expression, and stimulates kit ligand expression. Although the role of BMP-15 in female reproduction has progressively deserved much attention, there is nothing known to date about the signaling pathway and receptors for BMP-15. Using rat primary GCs and a human GC cell line, COV434, we have now found that administration of BMP-15 causes a rapid and transient phosphorylation, thus activation, of the Smad1/5/8 pathway. BMP-15 also stimulated promoter activity of a selective BMP-responsive reporter construct, further demonstrating the stimulation of Smad1/5/8 signaling by BMP-15. In contrast, BMP-15 stimulation of Smad2 phosphorylation was very weak. To identify the receptors for BMP-15, we utilized recombinant extracellular domains of individual transforming growth factor-beta superfamily receptors and found that activin receptor-like kinase-6 extracellular domain most effectively co-immunoprecipitates with BMP-15, whereas BMP receptor type II extracellular domain was most effective in inhibiting BMP-15 bioactivity on FSH-induced progesterone production and GC thymidine incorporation. We also investigated whether activation of the MAPK pathway is necessary for BMP-15 biological activity and found that the addition of U0126, an inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suppresses BMP-15 activity on GC mitotsis but not on FSH-induced progesterone production, suggesting a selective signaling cascade in GC proliferation and differentiation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
9378975,Molecular basis of HLA-C recognition by p58 natural killer cell inhibitory receptors.,"NK cells express several inhibitory receptors that recognize class I MHC molecules expressed on target cells. The NK cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) provide a key regulatory function for NK cells via specific interaction with MHC/peptide complexes, but the molecular details for recognition of class I MHC molecules by KIRs still remain unclear. Here we report cDNA cloning and expression of p58 KIRs and a p50 killer cell activatory receptor (KAR) from a Korean blood donor and demonstrate direct binding between recombinant soluble p58 KIRs and recombinant soluble HLA-C molecules. We identified three p58/p50 killer cell receptors (KAR-K1, KIR-K6, and KIR-K7), which are homologous to p50 cl-39, p58 47.11, and p58 cl-6, respectively. Native gel shift assay revealed that p58 KIR-K6 and KIR-K7 bind both HLA-Cw3 and HLA-Cw6 molecules, but p50 KAR-K1 binds neither of the HLA-C molecules. However, binding of HLA-C molecule by p58 KIR is affected by the antigenic peptide bound on the MHC molecule, suggesting that the p58 KIR binding to the HLA-C molecule may be dependent on the peptide. In addition, the binding interaction requires the presence of both p58 Ig domains, suggesting that the binding mode of HLA-C and p58 KIR may have some similarity to that of the neonatal Fc receptor and the Fc fragment of Ab and may be distinct from that of TCR and MHC.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1997
10934324,Molecular basis of semaphorin-mediated axon guidance.,"The semaphorin family of proteins constitute one of the major cues for axonal guidance. The prototypic member of this family is Sema3A, previously designated semD/III or collapsin-1. Sema3A acts as a diffusible, repulsive guidance cue in vivo for the peripheral projections of embryonic dorsal root ganglion neurons. Sema3A binds with high affinity to neuropilin-1 on growth cone filopodial tips. Although neuropilin-1 is required for Sema3A action, it is incapable of transmitting a Sema3A signal to the growth cone interior. Instead, the Sema3A/neuropilin-1 complex interacts with another transmembrane protein, plexin, on the surface of growth cones. Certain semaphorins, other than Sema3A, can bind directly to plexins. The intracellular domain of plexin is responsible for initiating the signal transduction cascade leading to growth cone collapse, axon repulsion, or growth cone turning. This intracellular cascade involves the monomeric G-protein, Rac1, and a family of neuronal proteins, the CRMPs. Rac1 is likely to be involved in semaphorin-induced rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, but how plexin controls Rac1 activity is not known. Vertebrate CRMPs are homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-33 protein, which is required for proper axon morphology in worms. CRMPs are essential for Sema3A-induced, neuropilin-plexin-mediated growth cone collapse, but the molecular interactions of growth cone CRMPs are not well defined. Mechanistic aspects of plexin-based signaling for semaphorin guidance cues may have implications for other axon guidance events and for the basis of growth cone motility.",Journal of neurobiology,2000

8889695,Molecular biology of MIS and its receptors.,"It is important, given the potential use of MIS as an anticancer agent against tumors of Müllerian duct origin, that the search continue to identify binding isoforms of the MIS type II receptor or to identify other factors in the heteromeric complex that might be required for specific binding of this ligand to be observed. With confidence in binding one can use receptor probes to screen patients with ovarian cancer and to identify those that express receptor. This subgroup can then be examined for binding of the MIS ligand and subsequently for antiproliferative response to MIS, in order to preselect candidate patients for receptor-directed MIS treatment. Thus, a once obscure phenomenon observed in the Freemartin has led to the purification and cloning of MIS and the identification of its receptor components, as well as an understanding of their regulation and expression. Elucidation of these molecular events brings us closer to the use of molecules such as MIS in the clinical setting.",Journal of andrology,1996
10422787,Molecular characterisation of cloned bradykinin B1 receptors from rat and human.,"This report describes the characterisation of cloned rat and human bradykinin B1 receptors in African green monkey kidney fibroblast (Cos-7) cells. A ligand binding assay with [3H]des-Arg10-kallidin was used to compare their pharmacology with respect to known bradykinin B1 and B2 receptor ligands. In addition, the pharmacology of T-kinin and its' derivative des-Arg11-T-kinin was investigated. The cloned rat receptor had a similar pharmacology to that of the recently described mouse receptor and differs from that described for the human receptor. The rat receptor had a higher affinity for des-Arg11-T-kinin than the human receptor. These differences in pharmacological properties may relate to the presence of T-kinin, bradykinin and their des-Arg derivatives as the major physiological peptides in rat and the predominance of kallidin and its derivatives in human. We confirm that the rat bradykinin B1 receptor gene is organised in a two exon structure and differs from the human gene which has a three exon structure and we further examine the inducible expression of this gene in a wide range of tissues using Northern blotting.",European journal of pharmacology,1999
1312036,"Molecular characterisation, expression and localisation of human neurokinin-3 receptor.","The complete amino acid sequence of the human neurokinin-3 receptor was deduced by DNA sequence analysis of human genomic fragments. Comparison of the predicted primary structure with those for the human neurokinin receptors 1 and 2 shows a highly conserved pattern of seven hydrophobic regions with maximum divergence occurring at the amino- and carboxy-termini. The position of intron-exon junctions are identical to those in other reported neurokinin genes. Using a chimeric genomic-cDNA gene, the human NK-3 receptor was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes where it mediates membrane conductance changes in response to its agonist, neurokinin B. More significantly, expression of the gene in mammalian cells resulted in detection of receptor binding as well as neurokinin-stimulated calcium mobilization and arachidonic acid release, all displaying the pharmacological characteristics expected of a neurokinin-3 receptor. By using the polymerase chain reaction we have shown that mRNA for the human neurokinin-3 receptor is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system.",,
9832121,Molecular characterization and expression of cloned human galanin receptors GALR2 and GALR3.,"Galanin is a 29- or 30-amino acid peptide with wide-ranging effects on hormone release, feeding behavior, smooth muscle contractility, and somatosensory neuronal function. Three distinct galanin receptor (GALR) subtypes, designated GALR1, 2, and 3, have been cloned from the rat. We report here the cloning of the human GALR2 and GALR3 genes, an initial characterization of their pharmacology with respect to radioligand binding and signal transduction pathways, and a profile of their expression in brain and peripheral tissues. Human GALR2 and GALR3 show, respectively, 92 and 89% amino acid sequence identity with their rat homologues. Radioligand binding studies with 125I-galanin show that recombinant human GALR2 binds with high affinity to human galanin (K(D) = 0.3 nM). Human GALR3 binds galanin with less affinity (IC50 of 12 nM for porcine galanin and 75 nM for human galanin). Human GALR2 was shown to couple to phospholipase C and elevation of intracellular calcium levels as assessed by aequorin luminescence in HEK-293 cells and by Xenopus melanophore pigment aggregation and dispersion assays, in contrast to human GALR1 and human GALR3, which signal predominantly through inhibition of adenylate cyclase. GALR2 mRNA shows a wide distribution in the brain (mammillary nuclei, dentate gyrus, cingulate gyrus, and posterior hypothalamic, supraoptic, and arcuate nuclei), and restricted peripheral tissue distribution with highest mRNA levels detected in human small intestine. In comparison, whereas GALR3 mRNA was expressed in many areas of the rat brain, there was abundant expression in the primary olfactory cortex, olfactory tubercle, the islands of Calleja, the hippocampal CA regions of Ammon's horn, and the dentate gyrus. GALR3 mRNA was highly expressed in human testis and was detectable in adrenal gland and pancreas. The genes for human GALR2 and 3 were localized to chromosomes 17q25 and 22q12.2-13.1, respectively.",Journal of neurochemistry,1998
8070404,Molecular characterization of a family of ligands for eph-related tyrosine kinase receptors.,"A family of tyrosine kinase receptors related to the product of the eph gene has been described recently. One of these receptors, elk, has been shown to be expressed only in brain and testes. Using a direct expression cloning technique, a ligand for the elk receptor has been isolated by screening a human placenta cDNA library with a fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of the receptor. This isolated cDNA encodes a transmembrane protein. While the sequence of the ligand cDNA is unique, it is related to a previously described sequence known as B61. Northern blot analysis of human tissue mRNA showed that the elk ligand's mRNA is 3.5 kb long and is found in placenta, heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney and pancreas. Southern blot analysis showed that the gene is highly conserved in a wide variety of species. Both elk ligand and B61 mRNAs are inducible by tumour necrosis factor in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In addition, both proteins show promiscuity in binding to the elk and the related hek receptors. Since these two ligand sequences are similar, and since elk and hek are members of a larger family of eph-related receptor molecules, we refer to these ligands as LERKs (ligands for eph-related kinases).",,
8940146,Molecular characterization of a novel human hybrid-type receptor that binds the alpha2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein.,"The 39-40-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) binds to the members of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family and functions as a specialized endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi chaperone. Using RAP affinity chromatography, we have purified a novel approximately 250-kDa brain protein and isolated the corresponding cDNA. The gene, designated SORL1, maps to chromosome 11q 23/24 and encodes a 2214-residue type 1 receptor containing a furin cleavage site immediately preceding the N terminus determined in the purified protein. The receptor, designated sorLA-1, has a short cytoplasmic tail containing a tyrosine-based internalization signal and a large external part containing (from the N-terminal): 1) a segment homologous to domains in the yeast vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein, Vps10p, that binds carboxypeptidase Y, 2) five tandemly arranged YWTD repeats and a cluster of 11 class A repeats characteristic of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family receptors, and 3) six tandemly arranged fibronectin type III repeats also found in certain neural adhesion proteins. sorLA-1 may therefore be classified as a hybrid receptor. Northern blotting revealed specific mRNA transcripts in brain, spinal cord, and testis but not in several major organs. Both RAP and an antibody against a synthetic peptide derived from a sequence determined in the mature protein detected sorLA-1 in crude human brain extracts. The domain structure suggests that sorLA-1 is an endocytic receptor possibly implicated in the uptake of lipoproteins and of proteases.",,

The IL-17 family of proteins binds to a unique mouse receptor (mIL-17R). Using nucleic acid hybridization techniques, a cDNA encoding a human homologue of the mIL-17R (hIL-17R) was isolated from a human T cell library. The predicted amino acid sequence of the hIL-17R is 69% identical to the mIL-17R, shares no homology with previously identified cytokine receptor families, and exhibits a broad tissue distribution. The hIL-17R gene was localized to chromosome 22. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated against the hIL-17R were able to block the IL-17-induced production of cytokine from human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells.

Orphan GPCRs have been used as targets to identify novel transmitter molecules. Here we describe the isolation from brain extracts and the characterization of the natural ligand of a particular orphan GPCR (SLC-1) that is sequentially homologous to the somatostatin receptors. We show that the natural ligand of this receptor is the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). MCH is a cyclic peptide that regulates a variety of functions in the mammalian brain, in particular feeding behaviour. We demonstrate that nanomolar concentrations of MCH strongly activate SLC-1-related pathways through G(alpha)i and/or G(alpha)q proteins. We have analysed the tissue localization of the MCH receptor and find that it is expressed in several brain regions, in particular those involved in olfactory learning and reinforcement mechanisms, indicating that therapies targeting the MCH receptor should act on the neuronal regulation of food consumption.",Nature,1999
7594543,Molecular characterization of two murine eosinophil beta chemokine receptors.,"beta or C-C chemokines including RANTES, MCP-3, MIP-1 alpha, and eotaxin have been implicated in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic inflammation. Two human beta chemokine receptors have been cloned and characterized: the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor or C-C chemokine receptor 1 (CCR-1) and the MCP-1 receptor or C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR-2). However, no murine beta chemokine receptors have thus far been reported. Molecular cloning from mouse genomic DNA and cDNA libraries yielded two murine beta chemokine receptors with 79% and 65% sequence identity with human CCR-1, and 50% and 55% with human CCR-2. COS cells transiently transfected with the murine homologue of human CCR-1 bind murine MIP-1 alpha and human RANTES with Kds of 3.4 nM and 4.2 nM and murine MIP-1 beta with an EC50 of 8.9 nM. The other murine beta chemokine receptor, which we have designated murine CCR-3, also binds murine MIP-1 alpha. The mRNAs for both receptors are expressed in eosinophils from IL-5 transgenic mice. The level of murine CCR-3 mRNA in these mouse eosinophils exceeds that of CCR-1 mRNA and approaches actin levels. Murine MIP-1 alpha was found to be a potent chemoattractant for murine eosinophils. Our findings suggest that the murine MIP-1 alpha ligand/receptor system is an important mediator of murine eosinophil trafficking.",,

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the gene encoding human GALR2 (GALNR2) has been localized to chromosome 17q25.3. The two coding exons of the human GALNR2 gene, interrupted by an intron positioned at the end of transmembrane domain III, encode a 387 amino acid G protein-coupled receptor with 87% overall amino acid identity with rat GALR2. In HEK-293 cells stably expressing human GALR2, binding of [125I]porcine galanin is saturable and can be displaced by galanin, amino-terminal galanin fragments and chimeric galanin peptides but not by carboxy-terminal galanin fragments. In HEK-293 cells, human GALR2 couples both to Galphaq/11 to stimulate phospholipase C and increase intracellular calcium levels and to Galphai/o to inhibit forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulation.

8676064,Molecular cloning and characterization of a human eotaxin receptor expressed selectively on eosinophils.,"The chemokine eotaxin is unusual in that it appears to be a highly specific chemoattractant for eosinophils. Ligand-binding studies with radiolabeled eotaxin demonstrated a receptor on eosinophils distinct from the known chemokine receptors CKR-1 and -2. The distinct eotaxin binding site on human eosinophils also bound RANTES (regulated on activation T expressed and secreted) and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)3. We have now isolated a cDNA from eosinophils, termed CKR-3, with significant sequence similarity to other well characterized chemokine receptors. Cells transfected with CKR-3 cDNA bound radiolabeled eotaxin specifically and with high affinity, comparable to the binding affinity observed with eosinophils. This receptor also bound RANTES and MCP-3 with high affinity, but not other CC or CXC chemokines. Furthermore, receptor transfectants generated in a murine B cell lymphoma cell line migrated in transwell chemotaxis assays to eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3, but not to any other chemokines. A monoclonal antibody recognizing CKR-3 was used to show that eosinophils, but not other leukocyte types, expressed this receptor. This pattern of expression was confirmed by Northern blot with RNA from highly purified leukocyte subsets. The restricted expression of CKR-3 on eosinophils and the fidelity of eotaxin binding to CKR-3, provides a potential mechanism for the selective recruitment and migration of eosinophils within tissues.",The Journal of experimental medicine,1996

However, the calcium-mobilizing receptor Edg-4 is not expressed in some cell lines that exhibit robust calcium responses to this ligand, thus predicting the existence of additional receptor subtypes. We report here on the characterization of a third human lysophosphatidic acid receptor subtype, Edg-7, which mediates lysophosphatidic acid-evoked calcium mobilization. In a rat hepatoma Rh7777 cell line that lacks endogenous responses to lysophosphatidic acid, this lipid mediator, but not others, evokes calcium transients when the cells have been transfected with Edg-7 or Edg-4 DNAs. Furthermore, frog oocytes exhibit a calcium-mediated chloride conductance in response to mammalian-selective lysophosphatidic acid mimetics after injection of Edg-7 mRNA. Edg-7-expressing Rh7777 cells do not show inhibition of forskolin-driven rises in cAMP in response to lysophosphatidic acid. However, membranes from HEK293T cells cotransfected with Edg-7 and G(i2)alpha protein DNAs show lysophosphatidic acid dose-dependent increases in [gamma-(35)S]GTP binding with an EC(50) value of 195 nM. When we used this assay to compare various synthetic LPA analogs at Edg-2, Edg-4, and Edg-7 receptors, we found that ethanolamine-based compounds, which are full LPA mimetics at Edg-2 and Edg-4, exhibit little activity at the Edg-7 receptor. Edg-7 RNA was detected in extracts of several rat and human tissues including prostate. Together, our data indicate that Edg-7 is a third lysophosphatidic acid receptor that couples predominantly to G(q/11)alpha proteins.",Molecular pharmacology,2000

Co-expression of the secretin receptor with the alpha-subunit of rat Gs protein increased the concentration of the high affinity receptor in the membrane fraction of the transfected COS cells. Secretin could stimulate accumulation of cAMP in COS cells expressing the cloned secretin receptor. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA has revealed that the secretin receptor consists of 449 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 48,696. The secretin receptor contains seven putative transmembrane segments, and belongs to a family of the G protein-coupled receptor. However, the amino acid sequence of the secretin receptor has no significant similarity with that of other G protein-coupled receptors. A 2.5 kb mRNA coding for the secretin receptor could be detected in NG108-15 cells, and rat heart, stomach and pancreatic tissue.",The EMBO journal,1991
7680413,Molecular cloning and expression of a human anterior pituitary receptor for growth hormone-releasing hormone.,"GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), acting through the GHRH receptor (GHRH-R), plays a pivotal role in the regulation of GH synthesis and secretion in the pituitary. It is possible that GHRH may serve other roles in other tissues. Here we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding a human GHRH-R from an acromegalic pituitary cDNA library. The isolated cDNA encodes a 423-amino acid protein that has seven putative transmembrane domains characteristic of G-protein-coupled receptors. It is a member of the secretin family of G-protein-coupled receptors and has 47%, 42%, 35%, and 28% identity with receptors for vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin, calcitonin, and PTH, respectively. Transient expression of this cDNA in COS cells induced saturable, high affinity, GHRH-specific binding and also stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulation in response to physiological concentrations of GHRH. A specific GHRH antagonist blocked both binding and second messenger response. Northern analysis indicated that GHRH-R mRNA was most abundant in extracts of pituitary and was not detected in other tissues.",,
1333056,Molecular cloning and expression of a pituitary-specific receptor for growth hormone-releasing hormone.,"A novel cDNA was isolated from rat pituitary mRNA using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify sequences encoding G protein-coupled receptors. The human homolog of this cDNA was isolated and expressed in human kidney 293 cells, and membrane fractions from these cells were found to bind human GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) with high affinity and specificity. GHRH also stimulates intracellular cAMP production in these transfected cells. The encoded receptor protein contains seven potential membrane-spanning domains, a hallmark of G protein-coupled receptors, and is homologous to previously identified receptors for secretin and vasoactive intestinal peptide, ligands that are related to GHRH. The rat GHRH receptor mRNA is expressed predominantly, if not exclusively, in the anterior pituitary gland, the major target for GHRH action. These results define a mechanism for cellular signaling by GHRH and provide the opportunity to examine the role of the GHRH receptor in growth abnormalities that involve the GH axis.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",1992
1560825,Molecular cloning and expression of a rat V1a arginine vasopressin receptor.,"The neurohypophyseal hormone arginine vasopressin has diverse actions, including the inhibition of diuresis, contraction of smooth muscle, stimulation of liver glycogenolysis and modulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone release from the pituitary. Arginine vasopressin receptors are G protein-coupled and have been divided into at least three types; the V1a (vascular/hepatic) and V1b (anterior pituitary) receptors which act through phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis to mobilize intracellular Ca2+, and the V2 (kidney) receptor which is coupled to adenylate cyclase. We report here the cloning of a complementary DNA encoding the hepatic V1a arginine vasopressin receptor. The liver cDNA encodes a protein with seven putative transmembrane domains, which binds arginine vasopressin and related compounds with affinities similar to the native rat V1a receptor. The messenger RNA corresponding to the cDNA is distributed in rat tissues known to contain V1a receptors.",Nature,1992
2158863,Molecular cloning and expression of a receptor for human tumor necrosis factor.,"A human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binding protein from serum of cancer patients was purified to homogeneity and partially sequenced. Synthetic DNA probes based on amino acid sequence information were used to isolate cDNA clones encoding a receptor for TNF. The TNF receptor (TNF-R) is a 415 amino acid polypeptide with a single membrane-spanning region. The extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the TNF-R is homologous to the nerve growth factor receptor and the B cell activation protein Bp50. Human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a TNF-R expression vector specifically bind both 125I-labeled and biotinylated TNF-alpha. Unlabeled TNF-alpha and TNF-beta were equally effective at displacing the binding of labeled TNF-alpha to TNF-R expressing cells. Northern analysis indicates a single species of mRNA for the TNF-R in a variety of cell types. Therefore, the soluble TNF binding protein found in human serum is probably proteolytically derived from the TNF-R.",,
8185599,Molecular cloning and expression of the gene encoding human angiotensin II type 2 receptor.,The gene of human angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor was isolated from a genomic DNA library prepared from human placenta. The coding region of the human AT2 receptor gene was contained in a single exon coding segment of the gene indicating an intronless structure of the coding region. The amino acid sequence of human AT2 receptor deduced from its nucleotide sequence has 363 amino acids and shows a high degree of sequence identity to rat and mouse receptor sequences. Specific binding of [125I]Sar1Ile8-angiotensin II was demonstrated in COS-7 cells transfected with a plasmid containing the human AT2 sequence. Scatchard analysis and ligand displacement profile were typical of the AT2 receptor. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that AT2 receptor mRNA was expressed in adult uterus and pheochromocytoma.,,
1732409,Molecular cloning and expression of the human interleukin 5 receptor.,"Human interleukin 5 (IL-5) plays an important role in proliferation and differentiation of human eosinophils. We report the isolation of cDNA clones from cDNA libraries of human eosinophils by using murine IL-5 receptor alpha chain cDNA as a probe. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence indicated that the human IL-5 receptor has approximately 70% amino acid sequence homology with the murine IL-5 receptor and retains features common to the cytokine receptor superfamily. One cDNA clone encodes a glycoprotein of 420 amino acids (Mr 47,670) with an NH2-terminal hydrophobic region (20 amino acids), a glycosylated extracellular domain (324 amino acids), a transmembrane domain (21 amino acids), and a cytoplasmic domain (55 amino acids). Another cDNA encodes only the extracellular domain of this receptor molecule. Other cDNA clones encode molecules having diversified cytoplasmic domains. COS7 cells transfected with the cDNA expressed a approximately 60-kD protein and bound IL-5 with a single class of affinity (Kd = 250-590 pM). The Kd values were similar to that observed in normal human eosinophils. In contrast to the murine 60-kD alpha chain, which binds IL-5 with low affinity (Kd = approximately 10 nM), the human alpha chain homologue can bind IL-5 with much higher affinity by itself. RNA blot analysis of human cells demonstrated two transcripts (approximately 5.3 and 1.4 kb). Both of them were expressed in normal human eosinophils and in erythroleukemic cell line TF-1, which responds to IL-5. The human IL-5 receptor characterized in this paper is essential for signal transduction, because expression of this molecule in murine IL-3-dependent cell line FDC-P1 allowed these cells to proliferate in response to IL-5.",,
1516719,Molecular cloning and expression of the human melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor cDNA.,"Melanocytes and melanoma cells are known to possess receptors for melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). A cDNA clone, designated 11D, has been isolated from human melanoma cells and encodes a MSH receptor. The cloned cDNA encodes a 317 amino acid protein with transmembrane topography characteristics of a G-protein-coupled receptor, but it does not show striking similarity to already published sequences of other G-protein-coupled receptors. When 11D cDNA is expressed in COS-7 cells, it binds an 125I-labelled MSH analogue (NDP-MSH) in a specific manner. The bound ligand could be displaced by melanotropic peptides, alpha-MSH, beta-MSH, gamma-MSH and ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), but not by the non-melanotropic peptide, beta-endorphin. This is the first report of the cloning of the receptor gene of the melanotropin receptor family.",FEBS letters,1992
7612008,Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a human secretin receptor.,"Secretin is a gastrointestinal hormone responsible for the regulation of bicarbonate, potassium ion and enzyme secretion from the pancreas. A cDNA encoding the human secretin receptor was isolated from a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell-line cDNA library using polymerase chain reaction and library screening techniques. The cDNA isolated is 1717 bp in length encoding a 440 amino acid long polypeptide. Computer analysis of the receptor indicated that it is a member of the glucagon-VIP-secretin receptor family and is a G-protein coupled receptor containing seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The receptor was subsequently expressed in COS-7 cells and was able to bind specifically to human secretin with high affinity as indicated by the competitive displacement assay. The human secretin receptor was found to be functionally coupled to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase resulting in the accumulation of intracellular cAMP in a dose-dependent manner. By Northern blot analysis, a 1.8 Kb mRNA was detected in human pancreas and intestine, while weak hybridization signals were detected in human colon, kidney and lung. Functional characterization of this receptor should enhance our understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of human secretin, its structure-function, receptor interaction and receptor tissue distribution.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1995
8663314,"Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a novel human CC chemokine receptor (CCR5) for RANTES, MIP-1beta, and MIP-1alpha.","Chemokines affect leukocyte chemotactic and activation activities through specific G protein-coupled receptors. In an effort to map the closely linked CC chemokine receptor genes, we identified a novel chemokine receptor encoded 18 kilobase pairs downstream of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) receptor (CCR2) gene on human chromosome 3p21. The deduced amino acid sequence of this novel receptor, designated CCR5, is most similar to CCR2B, sharing 71% identical residues. Transfected cells expressing the receptor bind RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed), MIP-1beta, and MIP-1alpha with high affinity and generate inositol phosphates in response to these chemokines. This same combination of chemokines has recently been shown to potently inhibit human immunodeficiency virus replication in human peripheral blood leukocytes (Cocchi, F., DeVico, A. L., Garzino-Demo, A., Arya, S. K., Gallo, R. C., and Lusso, P.(1995) Science 270, 1811-1815). CCR5 is expressed in lymphoid organs such as thymus and spleen, as well as in peripheral blood leukocytes, including macrophages and T cells, and is the first example of a human chemokine receptor that signals in response to MIP-1beta.",,
11274220,"Molecular cloning and functional characterization of MCH2, a novel human MCH receptor.","Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is involved in the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis. Recently, a 353-amino acid splice variant form of the human orphan receptor SLC-1 () (hereafter referred to as MCH(1)) was identified as an MCH receptor. This report describes the cloning and functional characterization of a novel second human MCH receptor, which we designate MCH(2), initially identified in a genomic survey sequence as being homologous to MCH(1) receptors. Using this sequence, a full-length cDNA was generated with an open reading frame of 1023 base pairs, encoding a polypeptide of 340 amino acids, with 38% identity to MCH(1) and with many of the structural features conserved in G protein-coupled receptors. This newly discovered receptor belongs to class 1 (rhodopsin-like) of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. HEK293 cells transfected with MCH(2) receptors responded to nanomolar concentrations of MCH with an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels and increased cellular extrusion of protons. In addition, fluorescently labeled MCH bound with nanomolar affinity to these cells. The tissue localization of MCH(2) receptor mRNA, as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, was similar to that of MCH(1) in that both receptors are expressed predominantly in the brain. The discovery of a novel MCH receptor represents a new potential drug target and will allow the further elucidation of MCH-mediated responses.",,
7929452,Molecular cloning and functional expression of a cDNA encoding the human V1b vasopressin receptor.,"Arginine vasopressin modulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone, beta-endorphin, and prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Release is mediated by the V1b receptor through the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. In contrast to its well characterized peripheral actions, such as antidiuresis, contraction of vascular smooth muscle, and stimulation of hepatic glycogenolysis, the exact site and mechanism of vasopressin action in the pituitary remain unclear. This is largely due to a lack of information on the molecular identity and exact localization of the V1b receptor. This lack prompted us to try to isolate this receptor subtype. Here we report the molecular cloning and functional expression of a complementary DNA encoding the human V1b receptor. The deduced 424-amino acid sequence of the receptor has highest overall homology with the V1a, V2, and oxytocin receptors, with homologies of 45, 39, and 45%, respectively. The receptor expressed in COS-1 cells has a single binding site for arginine vasopressin with a Kd of 0.17 +/- 0.04 nM. It binds various agonists and antagonists of vasopressin with affinities distinct from those of V1a and V2 receptors but consistent with those anticipated for the V1b receptor on the basis of the pharmacological studies. Furthermore, arginine vasopressin evoked calcium-dependent chloride current in Xenopus oocytes transfected with the receptor, which was not affected by a V1a/V2 antagonist. In contrast, the current evoked in oocytes transfected with V1a receptor was abolished by the antagonist. Northern blot analysis revealed that the receptor expression is restricted to the pituitary. These data clearly indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes the V1b receptor.",,
7588285,Molecular cloning and functional expression of a third isoform of the human calcitonin receptor and partial characterization of the calcitonin receptor gene.,"We have cloned and expressed two isoforms of the human calcitonin (hCT) receptor. Primers designed from the published sequence of a CT receptor cloned from an ovarian small cell carcinoma line were used for the polymerase chain reaction amplification of related products from human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. Two complementary DNAs were isolated. One clone lacks a 16-amino acid insert in the first intracellular loop and is virtually identical to the receptor recently cloned from the T47D human breast carcinoma cell line. The second clone is another splice variant lacking both the 16-amino acid insert in the first intracellular domain as well as the first 47 amino acids of the amino-terminus extracellular domain. COS-7 cells transfected with either receptor isoform bound [125I]salmon CT with high affinity and responded to hCT with increases in cAMP. Tissue distribution studies revealed the truncated extracellular domain 1 isoform transcripts in human skeletal muscle, kidney, brain, and lung. Analysis of a hCT receptor genomic clone demonstrated an exon/intron organization similar to that of the porcine CT receptor gene, except for a distinct exon coding for the alternatively spliced insert in the first intracellular domain.",Endocrinology,1995
8631787,Molecular cloning and functional expression of murine JE (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) and murine macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha receptors: evidence for two closely linked C-C chemokine receptors on chromosome 9.,"We have isolated cDNA clones that encode two closely related, murine C-C chemokine receptors. Both receptors are members of the G-protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane domain family of receptors and are most closely related to the human monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 receptor. Expression of each of the receptors was detected in murine monocyte/macrophage cell lines, but not in nonhematopoietic lines. Expression of these receptors in Xenopus oocytes revealed that one receptor signaled in response to low nanomolar concentrations of murine JE, whereas the second receptor was activated by murine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1alpha and the human chemokines MIP-1beta and RANTES. Binding studies revealed high affinity binding of radiolabeled mJE to the mJE receptor and murine MIP-1alpha to the second receptor. Chromosomal localization indicated that the two receptor genes were clustered within 80 kilobases of each other on mouse chromosome 9. Creation of receptor chimeras suggested that the amino terminus was critically involved in mediating signal transduction and ligand specificity of the mJE receptor, but not the mMIP-1alpha receptor. The identification and cloning of two functional murine chemokine receptors provides important new tools for investigating the roles of these potent cytokines in vivo.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
16298345,Molecular cloning and radioligand binding characterization of the chemokine receptor CCR5 from rhesus macaque and human.,"The aim of this study was to determine if macaque represents a suitable species for the pre-clinical evaluation of novel CCR5 antagonists, such as maraviroc (UK-427,857). To do this we cloned and expressed CCR5 from rhesus macaque and compared the binding properties of [125I]-MIP-1beta and [3H]-maraviroc with human recombinant CCR5. [125I]-MIP-1beta bound with similar high affinity to CCR5 from macaque (K(d) = 0.24 +/- 0.05 nM) and human (K(d) = 0.23 +/- 0.05 nM) and with similar kinetic properties. In competition binding studies the affinity of a range of human chemokines for macaque CCR5 was also similar to human CCR5. Maraviroc inhibited binding of [125I]-MIP-1beta to CCR5 from macaque and human with similar potency (IC50 = 17.50 +/- 1.24 nM and 7.18 +/- 0.93 nM, respectively) and antagonised MIP-1beta induced intracellular calcium release mediated through CCR5 from macaque and human with similar potency (IC50 = 17.50 +/- 3.30 nM and 12.07 +/- 1.89, respectively). [3H]-maraviroc bound with high affinity to CCR5 from macaque (K(d) = 1.36+/-0.07 nM) and human (K(d) = 0.86 +/- 0.08 nM), but was found to dissociate approximately 10-fold more quickly from macaque CCR5. However, as with the human receptor, maraviroc was shown to be a high affinity, potent functional antagonist of macaque CCR5 thereby indicating that the macaque should be a suitable species in which to evaluate the pharmacology, safety and potential mechanism-related toxicology of novel CCR5 antagonists.",Biochemical pharmacology,2005
7524088,Molecular cloning of a functional human galanin receptor.,"The ubiquitous neuropeptide galanin controls numerous functions such as endocrine secretions, intestinal motility, and behavioral activities. These regulatory effects of galanin are mediated through the interaction with specific membrane receptors and involve the pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide binding proteins Gi/Go as transducing elements. We report here the isolation of a cDNA coding for a human galanin receptor from a Bowes melanoma cell line cDNA expression library, by using a radioligand binding strategy. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned receptor reveals an open reading frame encoding a 349-amino acid protein with seven putative hydrophobic transmembrane domains and significant homology with members of the guanine nucleotide binding protein-coupled neuropeptide receptor family. The cloned receptor expressed in COS cells specifically binds human, porcine, and rat galanin with high affinity (Kd in the nanomolar range) and mediates the galanin inhibition of adenylate cyclase. A 2.8-kb galanin receptor transcript was identified in several human tissues. Cloning of this galanin receptor should enhance our knowledge of its distribution, structure, and function in human physiology and pathophysiology.",,
7534404,Molecular cloning of a ligand for the EPH-related receptor protein-tyrosine kinase Htk.,"Htk is a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase that is related to the EPH subfamily of tyrosine kinases. The receptor has a wide tissue distribution including expression in several myeloid hematopoietic cell lines. Using an Htk-Fc fusion protein, a protein ligand for this receptor was expression cloned from the murine kidney mesangial cell line SV40MES 13. The Htk ligand cDNA encodes a transmembrane protein of 336 amino acids. Binding competition experiments demonstrated a Kd of 535 pM for binding of Htk-Fc to the Htk ligand. Incubation of 3T3 cells expressing Htk with COS-7 cells expressing the ligand resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of Htk. The ligand, like its receptor, is widely expressed and may function in a variety of tissues. However, we localized hematopoietic expression of Htk to the monocytic lineage, suggesting that the ligand may play a role in differentiation and/or proliferation of these cells.",,
7505204,Molecular cloning of a ligand for the flt3/flk-2 tyrosine kinase receptor: a proliferative factor for primitive hematopoietic cells.,"Cloning of a ligand for the murine flt3/flk-2 tyrosine kinase receptor was undertaken using a soluble form of the receptor to identify a source of ligand. A murine T cell line, P7B-0.3A4, was identified that appeared to express a cell surface ligand for this receptor. A cDNA clone was isolated from an expression library prepared from these cells that was capable, when transfected into cells, of conferring binding to a soluble form of the flt3/flk-2 receptor. The cDNA for this ligand encodes a type I transmembrane protein that stimulates the proliferation of cells transfected with the flt3/flk-2 receptor. A soluble form of the ligand stimulates the proliferation of defined subpopulations of murine bone marrow and fetal liver cells as well as human bone marrow cells that are highly enriched for hematopoietic stem cells and primitive uncommitted progenitor cells.",Cell,1993
10488147,Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3.,"Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
9153236,"Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine EBI1-ligand chemokine that is a specific functional ligand for EBI1, CCR7.","By searching the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base, we identified partial cDNA sequences encoding a novel human CC chemokine. We determined the complete cDNA sequence that encodes a highly basic polypeptide of a total 98 amino acids with 20 to 30% identity to other human CC chemokines. We termed this novel chemokine from EBI1-Ligand Chemokine as ELC (see below). The ELC mRNA was most strongly expressed in the thymus and lymph nodes. Recombinant ELC protein was expressed as a fusion protein with the Flag tag (ELC-Flag). For receptor-binding assays, recombinant ELC protein fused with the secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was used. By stably expressing five CC chemokine receptors (CCR1 to 5) and five orphan receptors, ELC-SEAP was found to bind specifically to an orphan receptor EBI1. Only ELC-Flag, but not MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, eotaxin, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), or liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC), competed with ELC-SEAP for EBI1. ELC-Flag-induced transient calcium mobilization and chemotactic responses in EBI1-transfected cells. ELC-Flag also induced chemotaxis in HUT78 cells expressing endogenous EBI1 at high levels. By somatic hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, the gene for ELC (SCYA19) was mapped to chromosome 9p13 instead of chromosome 17q11.2 where the genes for CC chemokines are clustered. Taken together, ELC is a highly specific ligand for EBI1, which is known to be expressed in activated B and T lymphocytes and strongly up-regulated in B cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus and T cells infected with herpesvirus 6 or 7. ELC and EBI1 may thus play roles in migration and homing of normal lymphocytes, as well as in pathophysiology of lymphocytes infected with these herpesviruses. We propose EBI1 to be designated as CCR7.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
1376732,Molecular cloning of a novel hyaluronan receptor that mediates tumor cell motility.,"A cDNA encoding a unique hyaluronan receptor has been molecularly cloned from a lambda GT11 3T3 cDNA expression library. Immunoblot analyses of cell lysates, using antibodies to peptides encoded in the cDNA, specifically react with a 58-kD protein. This protein is regulated by the mutant H-ras gene in cells containing a metallothionein promoter H-ras hybrid gene. Further, antibodies to peptide sequences encoded in the cDNA block the increase in locomotion resulting from induction of the mutant H-ras gene in this cell line. In a transblot assay, the bacterially expressed protein binds to biotinylated hyaluronan. Antibodies to peptides encoded in the cDNA react in immunoblot assays with the 58- and 52-kD proteins of a novel hyaluronan receptor complex previously implicated in cell locomotion. Furthermore, antibodies specific to the 58- and 52-kD proteins, which block ras-induced locomotion, also cross-react with the expressed, encoded protein. The gene product described here appears to be a new type of hyaluronan receptor that is involved in cell locomotion. It is named RHAMM, an acronym for receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility.",,
11287427,Molecular cloning of a novel lipocalin-1 interacting human cell membrane receptor using phage display.,"Human lipocalin-1 (Lcn-1, also called tear lipocalin), a member of the lipocalin structural superfamily, is produced by a number of glands and tissues and is known to bind an unusually large array of hydrophobic ligands. Apart from its specific function in stabilizing the lipid film of human tear fluid, it is suggested to act as a physiological scavenger of potentially harmful lipophilic compounds, in general. To characterize proteins involved in the reception, detoxification, or degradation of these ligands, a cDNA phage-display library from human pituitary gland was constructed and screened for proteins interacting with Lcn-1. Using this method an Lcn-1 interacting phage was isolated that expressed a novel human protein. Molecular cloning and analysis of the entire cDNA indicated that it encodes a 55-kDa protein, lipocalin-1 interacting membrane receptor (LIMR), with nine putative transmembrane domains. The cell membrane location of this protein was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis of membrane fractions of human NT2 cells. Independent biochemical investigations using a recombinant N-terminal fragment of LIMR also demonstrated a specific interaction with Lcn-1 in vitro. Based on these data, we suggest LIMR to be a receptor of Lcn-1 ligands. These findings constitute the first report of cloning of a lipocalin interacting, plasma membrane-located receptor, in general. In addition, a sequence comparison supports the biological relevance of this novel membrane protein, because genes with significant nucleotide sequence similarity are present in Takifugu rubripes, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Bos taurus, and Sus scrofa. According to data derived from the human genome sequencing project, the LIMR-encoding gene has to be mapped on human chromosome 12, and its intron/exon organization could be established. The entire LIMR-encoding gene consists of about 13.7 kilobases in length and contains 16 introns with a length between 91 and 3438 base pairs.",,
1702217,Molecular cloning of a second subunit of the receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF): reconstitution of a high-affinity GM-CSF receptor.,"Using the mouse interleukin 3 (IL-3) receptor cDNA as a probe, we obtained a homologous cDNA (KH97) from a cDNA library of a human hemopoietic cell line, TF-1. The protein encoded by the KH97 cDNA has 56% amino acid sequence identity with the mouse IL-3 receptor and retains features common to the family of cytokine receptors. Fibroblasts transfected with the KH97 cDNA expressed a protein of 120 kDa but did not bind any human cytokines, including IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Interestingly, cotransfection of cDNAs for KH97 and the low-affinity human GM-CSF receptor in fibroblasts resulted in formation of a high-affinity receptor for GM-CSF. The dissociation rate of GM-CSF from the reconstituted high-affinity receptor was slower than that from the low-affinity site, whereas the association rate was unchanged. Cross-linking of 125I-labeled GM-CSF to fibroblasts cotransfected with both cDNAs revealed the same cross-linking patterns as in TF-1 cells--i.e., two major proteins of 80 and 120 kDa which correspond to the low-affinity GM-CSF receptor and the KH97 protein, respectively. These results indicate that the high-affinity GM-CSF receptor is composed of at least two components in a manner analogous to the IL-2 receptor. We therefore propose to designate the low-affinity GM-CSF receptor and the KH97 protein as the alpha and beta subunits of the GM-CSF receptor, respectively.",,

In equilibrium competition binding assays performed in undifferentiated HL-60 cells transfected with human and murine CC CKR-4 cDNA, the IC50 values for the binding of [125I]macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha to human and murine CC CKR-4 were 14.5 +/- 9.0 nM and 10.1 +/- 3.0 nM, respectively, and the IC50 values for the binding of [125I]RANTES to human and murine CC CKR-4 were 9.3 +/- 3.0 nM and 5.7 +/- 2.6 nM, respectively. The cDNA clone for murine CC CKR-4 is 1531 bp, and the largest open reading frame encodes a protein of 360 amino acids that is 85% identical to human CC CKR-4. Murine CC CKR-4 was detected in the thymus and T-cell lines by Northern blot analysis.

In spleen, CD8+ cells and NK1.1+ cells were found to express mXCR1. Identification of mXCR1 will now allow us to study the role of this unique cytokine system in the mouse models of inflammation and immunity.",FEBS letters,1999
7670098,Molecular cloning of two isoforms of a receptor for the human hematopoietic cytokine interleukin-11.,"Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a stromal cell-derived cytokine with multiple biologic activities on lymphohematopoietic cells. It belongs to a family of pleiotropic and redundant cytokines that use the gp 130 transducing subunit in their high affinity receptors. By amplifying human cDNA libraries with oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the conserved WSXWS motif found in the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family, a novel cytokine receptor cDNA was identified that, based on high (82%) sequence homology with the recently cloned murine IL-11 receptor, appears to encode the human IL-11 receptor. This receptor is a 422-amino acid protein containing a signal peptide followed by extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. The extracellular region has a two-domain structure homologous to those of the IL-6 and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptors: an immunoglobulin-like domain and a cytokine receptor-like domain. In addition, an isoform of the human IL-11 receptor that lacks the cytoplasmic domain was also identified. In agreement with the pleiotropic effects of IL-11 on different hematopoietic lineages and bone cells, IL-11 receptor transcripts were found to be expressed by the myelogenous leukemia cell line K562, the megakaryocytic leukemia cell line Mo7E, the erythroleukemia cell line TF1, and the osteosarcoma cell lines MG-63 and Saos-2.",,
8185570,"Molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of a fifth melanocortin receptor.","We report the isolation of a gene encoding a novel member of the family of melanocortin receptors. The mouse melanocortin-5 receptor (mMC5R) responds to melanocortins with an increase in intracellular cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations. Stimulation of the mMC5R by the melanocortins revealed a hierarchy of potency in which alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) > beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone (beta-MSH) > adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) > gamma- melanocyte stimulating hormone (gamma-MSH). Further structure-activity studies indicated that amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions of alpha-MSH appear to be key determinants in the activation of mMC5R whereas the melanocortin core heptapeptide sequence is devoid of pharmacological activity. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of mMC5R mRNA in mouse skeletal muscle, lung, spleen, and brain.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1994
7908405,"Molecular cloning, functional characterization, and chromosomal localization of a human somatostatin receptor (somatostatin receptor type 5) with preferential affinity for somatostatin-28.","Using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and genomic library screening we have cloned a human gene for a subtype of the somatostatin (SST) receptor (SSTR) termed human SSTR5 (hSSTR5), which is located on chromosome 16. The predicted amino acid sequence of hSSTR5 displays 75% sequence identity with a recently identified rat SSTR [Mol. Pharmacol. 42:939-946 (1992)], suggesting that it is the human homologue of this receptor. hSSTR5 consists of a 363-residue polypeptide exhibiting a putative seven-transmembrane domain topology typical of G protein-coupled receptors. The receptor displays considerable sequence identity to hSSTR1 (42%), hSSTR2 (48%), hSSTR3 (47%), and hSSTR4 (46%). Membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transiently expressing the hSSTR5 gene bound 125I-Leu8,D-Trp22,Tyr25-SST-28 (125I-LTT-SST-28) with high affinity and in a saturable manner. SST-14, SST-28, and various synthetic SST peptide agonists produced dose-dependent inhibition of radioligand binding with the following rank order of potency: LTT-SST-28 > SST-28 > D-Trp8-SST-14 > SST-14 approximately RC-160 approximately BIM 23014 > MK-678 > SMS 201-995. hSSTR5 bound SST-28 with a 12.6-fold greater affinity (Ki = 0.19 nM), compared with SST-14 (Ki = 2.24 nM), indicating that the receptor is SST-28 selective. Addition of GTP, guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate, Na+ ions, or pertusis toxin greatly reduced 125I-LTT-SST-28 binding, thereby indicating that hSSTR5 is coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Both SST-14 and SST-28 displayed dose-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, consistent with functional coupling of the receptor to adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Northern blot analysis of SSTR5 mRNA revealed a 2.4-kilobase transcript in normal rat pituitary and GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells and a 4.0-kilobase transcript in normal human pituitary. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed expression of the hSSTR gene in fetal human pituitary and hypothalamus but not in human cerebral cortex. In situ hybridization of the rat pituitary showed that SSTR5 mRNA is selectively localized in the anterior lobe. SSTR5 mRNA was not expressed in four human pituitary tumors (somatotroph adenoma, prolactinoma, and chromophobe adenomas) or in a human insulinoma. Although hSSTR5 displays approximately 75% sequence identity with rat SSTR5, the two receptors display significantly different pharmacological profiles, especially with respect to their binding affinities for the SST analogue SMS 201-995.",Molecular pharmacology,1994
7589426,"Molecular cloning, functional expression, and signal transduction of the GIP-receptor cloned from a human insulinoma.","Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) plays an important role in the regulation of postprandial insulin secretion and proinsulin gene expression of pancreatic beta-cells. This study demonstrates the molecular cloning of a cDNA for the GIP-receptor from a human insulinoma lambda gt11 cDNA library. The cloned cDNA encoded a seven transmembrane domain protein of 466 amino acids which showed high homology (41%) to the human glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor. Homology to the GIP receptor from rat or hamster was 79% and 81%, respectively. When transfected stably into fibroblast CHL-cells a high affinity receptor was expressed which coupled to the adenylate cyclase with normal basal cAMP and increasing intracellular cAMP levels under stimulation with human GIP-1-42 (EC50 = 1.29 x 10(-13) M). The receptor accepted only human GIP 1-42 (Kd = 1.93 +/- 0.2 x 10(-8) M) and porcine truncated GIP 1-30 (Kd = 1.13 +/- 0.1 x 10(-8) M) as high affinity ligands. At 1 microM, exendin-4 and (9-39)amide weakly reduced GIP-binding (25%) whereas secretin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, peptide histidine-isoleucine, and pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide were without effect. In transfected CHL cells, GIP-1-42 did not increase intracellular calcium. Northern analysis revealed one transcript of human GIP receptor mRNA with an apparent size of 5.5 kb. The exact understanding of GIP receptor regulation and signal transduction will aid in the understanding of the incretin hormone's failure to exert its biological action at the pancreatic B-cell in type II diabetes mellitus.",FEBS letters,1995

Human and murine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), human human monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and RANTES all bind to the C-C CKR-1 with varying affinities. Chemokine binding affinity does not predict how well the ligand will transmit a signal through the receptor: RANTES and human MIP-1 alpha induce a similar intracellular calcium flux while binding with disparate affinities, while MCP-1 and human MIP-1 beta induce calcium mobilization only at high concentrations. Finally, C-C chemokines were shown to bind a C-C CKR-1-related gene product encoded by cytomegalovirus, suggesting a role for C-C chemokines in viral immunity.",Cell,1993

Within the family of human AVP receptors, the V2 AVP receptor has been cloned, but the structure of the human V1a and V1b AVP receptors remains unknown. We report here the structure and functional expression of a human V1a AVP receptor complementary DNA isolated from human liver cDNA libraries. Cloning and sequencing of a full-length clone isolated a 1472-nucleotide sequence encoding a 418-amino acid polypeptide with seven putative transmembrane domains typical of G protein-coupled receptors. Amino acid sequence identity with the rat liver V1a AVP receptor, the human and rat V2 AVP receptors, and the human oxytocin receptor was 72, 36, 37, and 45%, respectively. Functional characterization of the cloned receptor was done by transient expression in COS-7 cells and stable expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Localization of the expressed receptor at the cellular surface was illustrated by using the fluorescent linear analog phenylacetyl-D-Tyr(Et)-Phe-Gln-Asn-Lys-Pro-Arg-NH2 coupled to fluorescein-avidin by dodecabiotin. Competition binding experiments with phenylacetyl-D-Tyr(Et)-Phe-Val-Asn-Lys-Pro-[125I]Tyr-NH2 and AVP analogs revealed high affinity specific binding sites of the V1a subtype. Saturation binding experiments with [3H]AVP confirmed the presence of a single class of high affinity binding sites. Measurement of AVP-induced inositol phosphate production and calcium mobilization confirmed that the expressed V1a AVP receptor is coupled to phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. Thus, the human V1a AVP receptor belongs to the superfamily of seven-transmembrane segment receptors with a significant sequence identity with the other members of the AVP-oxytocin family of receptors.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1994
11101306,Molecular determinants of ligand binding to the human melanocortin-4 receptor.,"To elucidate the molecular basis for the interaction of ligands with the human melanocortin-4 receptor (hMC4R), agonist structure-activity studies and receptor point mutagenesis were performed. Structure-activity studies of [Nle(4), D-Phe(7)]-alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (NDP-MSH) identified D-Phe7-Arg8-Trp9 as the minimal NDP-MSH fragment that possesses full agonist efficacy at the hMC4R. In an effort to identify receptor residues that might interact with amino acids in this tripeptide sequence 24 hMC4R transmembrane (TM) residues were mutated (the rationale for choosing specific receptor residues for mutation is outlined in the Results section). Mutation of TM3 residues D122 and D126 and TM6 residues F261 and H264 decreased the binding affinity of NDP-MSH 5-fold or greater, thereby identifying these receptor residues as sites potentially involved in the sought after ligand-receptor interactions. By examination of the binding affinities and potencies of substituted NDP-MSH peptides at receptor mutants, evidence was found that core melanocortin peptide residue Arg8 interacts at a molecular level with hMC4R TM3 residue D122. TM3 mutations were also observed to decrease the binding of hMC4R antagonists. Notably, mutation of TM3 residue D126 to alanine decreased the binding affinity of AGRP (87-132), a C-terminal derivative of the endogenous melanocortin antagonist, 8-fold, and simultaneous mutations D122A/D126A completely abolished AGRP (87-132) binding. In addition, mutation of TM3 residue D122 or D126 decreased the binding affinity of hMC4R antagonist SHU 9119. These results provide further insight into the molecular determinants of hMC4R ligand binding.",,
11432858,Molecular determinants of receptor binding and signaling by the CX3C chemokine fractalkine.,"Fractalkine/CX3CL1 is a membrane-tethered chemokine that functions as a chemoattractant and adhesion protein by interacting with the receptor CX3CR1. To understand the molecular basis for the interaction, an extensive mutagenesis study of fractalkine's chemokine domain was undertaken. The results reveal a cluster of basic residues (Lys-8, Lys-15, Lys-37, Arg-45, and Arg-48) and one aromatic (Phe-50) that are critical for binding and/or signaling. The mutant R48A could bind but not induce chemotaxis, demonstrating that Arg-48 is a signaling trigger. This result also shows that signaling residues are not confined to chemokine N termini, as generally thought. F50A showed no detectable binding, underscoring its importance to the stability of the complex. K15A displayed unique signaling characteristics, eliciting a wild-type calcium flux but minimal chemotaxis, suggesting that this mutant can activate some, but not all, pathways required for migration. Fractalkine also binds the human cytomegalovirus receptor US28, and analysis of the mutants indicates that US28 recognizes many of the same epitopes of fractalkine as CX3CR1. Comparison of the binding surfaces of fractalkine and the CC chemokine MCP-1 reveals structural details that may account for their dual recognition by US28 and their selective recognition by host receptors.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
10854439,Molecular determinants of tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) selectivity for the parathyroid hormone-2 (PTH2) receptor. N-terminal truncation of TIP39 reverses PTH2 receptor/PTH1 receptor binding selectivity.,"Tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) and the parathyroid hormone-2 (PTH2) receptor form part of an extended family of related signaling molecules that includes the PTH1 receptor, which responds to PTH and PTH-related protein. TIP39 does not appreciably activate the PTH1 receptor, but in this study it is shown to bind the receptor with moderate affinity (59 nm). In this study, we investigated the molecular determinants of both ligand and receptor for the PTH2 receptor selectivity of TIP39 and quantitatively evaluated the role of molecular elements in the binding of TIP39 to the PTH2 and PTH1 receptors. A chimeric receptor composed of the N-terminal extracellular domain of the PTH1 receptor and the remainder (juxtamembrane domain) of the PTH2 receptor (P2-NP1) was fully activated by TIP39 (E(max) = 98% of the rPTH-(1-34), E(max), EC(50) = 2.0 nm). This receptor chimera bound TIP39 with an equivalent affinity to the wild-type PTH2 receptor (2. 3 and 2.0 nm, respectively). The reciprocal chimeric receptor (P1-NP2) was not activated by TIP39 and bound the ligand with an affinity equivalent to that of the PTH1 receptor. Thus, the juxtamembrane receptor domain specifies the signaling and binding selectivity of TIP39 for the PTH2 receptor over the PTH1 receptor. Removing six N-terminal residues of TIP39 eliminated activation of the PTH2 receptor and reduced binding affinity 70-fold. In contrast, this truncation increased affinity for the PTH1 receptor 10-fold, reversing the PTH2/PTH1 receptor binding selectivity and resulting in a high affinity interaction of TIP-(7-39) with the PTH1 receptor (6 nm). These findings can be explained by a strong interaction between the N-terminal region of TIP39 and the juxtamembrane domain of the PTH2 receptor, with the corresponding domain of the PTH1 receptor acting as a selectivity barrier against high affinity binding of TIP39. As a result, TIP-(7-39) is a highly potent, selective antagonist for the PTH1 receptor.",,
30978219,Molecular determinants of WNT9b responsiveness in nephron progenitor cells.,"Primed nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) appear in metanephric mesenchyme by E11.5 and differentiate in response to the inductive WNT9b signal from the ureteric bud. However, the NPC WNT-receptor complex is unknown. We obtained M15 cells from E10.5 mesonephric mesenchyme and systematically analyzed components required for canonical WNT9b-responsiveness. When M15 cells were transfected with a β-catenin luciferase reporter plasmid, exposure to recombinant WNT9b resulted in minimal luciferase activity. We then analyzed mRNA-expression of WNT-pathway components and identified Fzd1-6 and Lrp6 transcripts but not Rspo1. When M15 cells were treated with recombinant RSPO1 the response to transfected WNT9b was augmented 4.8-fold. Co-transfection of M15 cells with Fzd5 (but no other Fzd family member) further increased the WNT9b signal to 16.8-fold and siRNA knockdown of Fzd5 reduced the signal by 52%. Knockdown of Lrp6 resulted in 60% WNT9b signal reduction. We confirmed Fzd5, Lrp6 and Rspo1 mRNA expression in CITED1(+) NPCs from E15.5 embryonic mouse kidney. Thus, while many WNT signaling-pathway components are present by E10.5, optimum responsiveness of E11.5 cap mesenchyme requires that NPCs acquire RSPO1, FZD5 and LRP6.",,
12815165,Molecular determination of agouti-related protein binding to human melanocortin-4 receptor.,"Agouti-related protein (AGRP) is an endogenous antagonist of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) that functions in the hypothalamic control of feeding behavior. Our previous studies have suggested that in addition to exoloops 2 and 3, several transmembrane domains of MC4R may be important for AGRP binding. However, the detailed molecular basis of MC4R domains in AGRP binding is presently unclear. The present studies were designed to determine the specific contribution of MC4R exoloops and transmembrane domains to AGRP binding by using chimeric receptor constructs of the human melanocortin-1 receptor (hMC1R), a receptor that is not inhibited by AGRP, and the human MC4R (hMC4R), a receptor that is potently inhibited by AGRP. Our results indicate that substitutions of the second and third extracellular loops of the MC4R with homologous domains of the MC1R dramatically decreased AGRP 87-132 binding affinity, but did not affect AGRP 110-117 binding affinity. In contrast, cassette substitutions of the third or fourth transmembrane domain of the MC4R with the homologous domain of the MC1R resulted in a substantial decrease of AGRP 87-132 binding affinity and loss of AGRP 110-117 binding affinity. These data suggest that the AGRP fragment 110-117 has no binding sites at exoloops of hMC4R and that transmembrane domains of MC4R may play an important role in AGRP 110-117 binding and function, whereas the exoloops do not. The second and third extracellular loops of MC4R are important for AGRP 87-132 N-terminal binding, whereas the third and fourth transmembrane domains of hMC4R are crucial for AGRP 110-117 binding.",,
9013611,Molecular identification of a novel candidate sorting receptor purified from human brain by receptor-associated protein affinity chromatography.,"Receptor-associated protein (RAP) is an endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi protein involved in the processing of receptors of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. A approximately 95-kDa membrane glycoprotein, designated gp95/sortilin, was purified from human brain extracts by RAP affinity chromatography and cloned in a human cDNA library. The gene maps to chromosome 1p and encodes an 833-amino acid type I receptor containing an N-terminal furin cleavage site immediately preceding the N terminus determined in the purified protein. Gp95/sortilin is expressed in several tissues including brain, spinal cord, and testis. Gp95/sortilin is not related to the low density lipoprotein receptor family but shows intriguing homologies to established sorting receptors: a 140-amino acid lumenal segment of sortilin representing a hitherto unrecognized type of extracellular module shows extensive homology to corresponding segments in each of the two lumenal domains of yeast Vps10p, and the extreme C terminus of the cytoplasmic tail of sortilin contains the casein kinase phosphorylation consensus site and an adjacent dileucine sorting motif that mediate assembly protein-1 binding and lysosomal sorting of the mannose-6-phosphate receptors. Expression of a chimeric receptor containing the cytoplasmic tail of gp95/sortilin demonstrates evidence that the tail conveys colocalization with the cation-independent mannose6-phosphate receptor in endosomes and the Golgi compartment.",,
7882989,Molecular identification of guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins which couple to endothelin receptors.,"The coupling of two endothelin receptor subtypes (ET(A) and ETB) to several types of guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein) was examined. Two subtypes of receptor cDNAs were transfected alone or together with four different G protein alpha subunit cDNAs in COS-7 cells. In ET(A) receptor-transfected cells, endothelin-1 (ET-1) activated phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C as measured by the production of phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3]. ETB-receptor-transfected cells also produced Ins(1,4,5)P3 on stimulation by ET-1. The ET-1-induced production of Ins(1,4,5)P3 was markedly higher in G alpha q-cotransfected or G alpha 11-cotransfected cells than in cells transfected with each receptor alone. ET-1 also stimulated production of cAMP in ET(A) or ETB receptor-transfected cells. The production of cAMP was synergistically amplified by G alpha s co-transfection with each receptor. In contrast, when G alpha i2 was co-transfected with the ET(A) or ETB receptor, ET-1 displayed an inhibitory action on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Pertussis-toxin treatment of the G alpha i2-transfected cells resulted in abolition of the endothelin-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation. These observations indicate that both ET(A) and ETB receptors are able to couple to Gq, G11, Gs and Gi2, and suggest that endothelin receptors stimulate multiple effectors via several types of G protein simultaneously. The overall effects induced by endothelin may differ in cell types depending on the level of expression of each G-protein subtype in the cell.",European journal of biochemistry,1995
9893984,Molecular interaction of Agouti protein and Agouti-related protein with human melanocortin receptors.,"Agouti protein and the Agouti-related protein (AGRP) are antagonists of the melanocortin-3 receptor and melanocortin-4 receptor. Both proteins contain 10 cysteines in the C-terminal domain arranged in five disulfide bonds. One possible arrangement of the disulfide bonds predicts an octapeptide loop, and the chemical properties of four residues within this loop (residues 111-114 in human AGRP) bear striking resemblance to those of several melanocortin peptides, including alpha-MSH, MT-II, and SHU-9119. We showed that cyclic synthetic octapeptides based on the sequence of this loop from Agouti protein or human AGRP are functional antagonists of the human melanocortin-4 receptor. All peptides had a lower affinity for the melanocortin-3 receptor than for the melanocortin-4 receptor. Substitution of serines for cysteines resulted in linear peptides which had reduced binding affinities for both receptors. Mutational analysis of human AGRP indicated that its C-terminal domain is functionally equivalent to the intact human AGRP. The RFF111-113 triplet appears to be the most critical portion of AGRP in determining the binding affinity for both melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors. These data strongly suggest that the loop defined by Cys-110 and Cys-117 is critical in determining the antagonist activity of human AGRP. Our data provide indirect evidence for the suggestion that the Cys-110 to Cys-117 octapeptide loop of human AGRP mimics the conformation of alpha-MSH, MT-II, and SHU-9119.",Biochemistry,1999
11107061,"Molecular mechanism of monocyte predominant infiltration in chronic inflammation: mediation by a novel monocyte chemotactic factor, S19 ribosomal protein dimer.","A novel monocyte chemotactic factor, a cross-linked homodimer of S19 ribosomal protein (RP S19) was initially isolated from a rheumatoid arthritis synovial lesion. The RP S19 dimer causes the monocyte specific chemotaxis in vitro and the monocyte predominant infiltration in vivo, via its agonistic and antagonistic effects on the C5a receptors of monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, respectively. The agonistic effect is attributed to the similarity of regional structures between RP S19 and C5a, the complement C5-derived leukocyte chemotactic factor, although overall homology of the amino acid sequence between these molecules is only 4%. The antagonistic effect depends upon the C-terminal portion of RP S19. The RP S19 dimer is produced and released by apoptotic cells, and this dimer recruits monocytes from the circulation to the apoptotic lesion. The infiltrated monocytes/macrophages engulf the apoptotic cells, translocate to regional lymph nodes via lymphatics and present the antigenic information of the apoptotic cells to the T cell repertoire. In this manner, the apoptotic cell clearance system connects to the acquired immune system. The innate and acquired immune mechanisms, mediated by the RP S19 dimer, participate in the pathology of inveterate chronic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis.",,
12210842,Molecular mechanisms involved in the actions of apotransferrin upon the central nervous system: Role of the cytoskeleton and of second messengers.,"Apotransferrin (aTf), intracranially administered into newborn rats, produces increased myelination with marked increases in the levels of myelin basic protein (MBP), phospholipids and galactolipids, and mRNAs of MBP and 2', 3' cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (CNPase). Cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin, actin, and microtubule-associated proteins are also increased after aTf injection. In contrast, almost no changes are observed in myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) or in its mRNA or cholesterol. In the present study, we used brain-tissue slices and cell cultures highly enriched for oligodendroglia to investigate signaling pathways involved in the action of aTf, and to find out whether cytoskeletal integrity and dynamics were essential for its action upon the neural expression of certain genes. Treatment of brain-tissue slices with aTf produced a marked increase in the expression of MBP, CNPase, and tubulin mRNAs. Colchicine, cytochalasin, and taxol severely reduced the effect of aTf. Addition to cultures of an antibody against transferrin receptor (TfR), protein kinase inhibitors, or a cyclic AMP (cAMP) analogue showed that a functionally intact TfR was necessary, and that tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C and A, as well as calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase (Ca-CaMK) activities appeared to mediate aTf actions upon the expression of the above mentioned genes. Changes in the levels of phosphoinositides and cAMP induced by aTf in oligodendroglial cell (OLGc) cultures correlated with these results and coincide with an activation of the cyclic response element binding protein (CREB) and of mitogen activated protein kinases. The increased expression of certain myelin genes produced by aTf appear to be mediated by interaction of this glycoprotein with its receptor, by the cytoskeleton of the OLGc, and by a complex activation of protein kinases which lead to CREB phosphorylation.",,

The classic definition of T cell co-stimulation continues to evolve through the identification of new co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptors, the biochemical characterization of their downstream signalling events and the delineation of their immunological functions. Notably, it has been recently appreciated that co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptors display great diversity in expression, structure and function, and that their functions are largely context dependent. Here, we focus on some of these emerging concepts and review the mechanisms through which T cell activation, differentiation and function is controlled by co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptors.",Nature reviews.

9464567,Molecular modeling of interleukin-8 receptor beta and analysis of the receptor-ligand interaction.,"A structural model of interleukin-8 receptor type beta (IL-8R-beta) was constructed based on the structure of bacteriorhodopsin. High temperature molecular dynamics simulations were performed to search the possible conformations of loop regions in IL-8R-beta which recognize the ligand. The crystal structure of interleukin 8 (IL-8) was used as a geometric constraint of the extracellular loop regions of IL-8R-beta in the conformational search. 500 complex structures were extracted from the dynamics trajectory and five plausible models were selected based on the binding energy and known experimental data. To study further the interaction between IL-8R-beta and its ligands, the complex of IL-8R-beta and platelet factor 4 (PF4) C-terminal peptide was also modeled by molecular dynamics simulations. From these models, the N-terminus, extracellular domain 3 and extracellular domain 4 of IL-8R-beta were found to be important for ligand binding. Key residues of these regions involved in ligand binding were characterized. These models provide insight into the structural basis of biological activity of IL-8 and PF4 and may guide the design of potential therapeutic agents targeting IL-8 receptors. Furthermore, the approach developed from this study may have implications for the understanding of other chemokine receptor-ligand interactions that have been recently suggested to be involved in HIV infection.",,

Using a technique combining multiple sequence alignments with available experimental constraints, a reliable OTR model was built. Subsequently, the OTR complexes with a selective agonist [Thr4,Gly7]OT, a selective cyclohexapeptide antagonist L-366,948 and oxytocin itself were modeled and relaxed using a constrained simulated annealing (CSA) protocol. All three ligands seem to prefer similar modes of binding to the receptor, manifested by repeating receptor residues which directly interact with the ligands. Those involved in the three complexes are putative helices: TM3: R113, K116, Q119, M123; TM4: Q171, and TM5: I201 and T205.

11336787,Molecular properties of apelin: tissue distribution and receptor binding.,"We analyzed the tissue distribution of apelin mRNA in rats by a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and that of immunoreactive apelin (ir-apelin) by an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using a monoclonal antibody. The expression levels of apelin mRNA and ir-apelin seemed to be consistent among tissues: they were highly expressed in the lung and mammary gland. By the combination of gel filtration and EIA, we found that the molecular forms of apelin differ among respective tissues: apelin molecules with sizes close to apelin-36 (long forms) were major components in the lung, testis, and uterus, but both long and short (whose sizes were close to [<Glu(65)]apelin-13) forms were detected in the mammary gland. In Scatchard analyses, the radioiodinated apelin-36 analogue bound to the receptor, APJ, with high affinity. In competitive binding assays, apelin-36 and apelin-19 far more efficiently inhibited the binding of the labeled apelin-36 analogue with APJ than [<Glu(65)]apelin-13. In analyses for the dissociation of apelin from APJ, unlabeled apelin-36 replaced more rapidly the labeled apelin-36 analogue bound with APJ than [<Glu(65)]apelin-13. Our results demonstrate that the long and short forms of apelin differently interact with APJ.",,
15064755,Molecular recognition of BMP-2 and BMP receptor IA.,"Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and other members of the TGF-beta superfamily regulate the development, maintenance and regeneration of tissues and organs. Binding epitopes for these extracellular signaling proteins have been defined, but hot spots specifying binding affinity and specificity have so far not been identified. In this study, mutational and structural analyses show that epitopes of BMP-2 and the BRIA receptor form a new type of protein-protein interface. The main chain atoms of Leu 51 and Asp53 of BMP-2 represent a hot spot of binding to BRIA. The BMP-2 variant L51P was deficient in type I receptor binding only, whereas its overall structure and its binding to type II receptors and modulator proteins, such as noggin, were unchanged. Thus, the L51P substitution converts BMP-2 into a receptor-inactive inhibitor of noggin. These results are relevant for other proteins of the TGF-beta superfamily and provide useful clues for structure-based drug design.",,
2474557,Monoclonal antibodies to human lymphocyte homing receptors define a novel class of adhesion molecules on diverse cell types.,"A 90-kD lymphocyte surface glycoprotein, defined by monoclonal antibodies of the Hermes series, is involved in lymphocyte recognition of high endothelial venules (HEV). Lymphocyte gp90Hermes binds in a saturable, reversible fashion to the mucosal vascular addressin (MAd), a tissue-specific endothelial cell adhesion molecule for lymphocytes. We and others have recently shown that the Hermes antigen is identical to or includes CD44 (In[Lu]-related p80), human Pgp-1, and extracellular matrix receptor III-molecules reportedly expressed on diverse cell types. Here, we examine the relationship between lymphoid and nonlymphoid Hermes antigens using serologic, biochemical, and, most importantly, functional assays. Consistent with studies using mAbs to CD44 or Pgp-1, mAbs against five different epitopes on lymphocyte gp90Hermes reacted with a wide variety of nonhematolymphoid cells in diverse normal human tissues, including many types of epithelium, mesenchymal elements such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle, and a subset of glia in the central nervous system. To ask whether these non-lymphoid molecules might also be functionally homologous to lymphocyte homing receptors, we assessed their ability to interact with purified MAd using fluorescence energy transfer techniques. The Hermes antigen isolated from both glial cells and fibroblasts--which express a predominant 90-kD form similar in relative molecular mass, isoelectric point, and protease sensitivity to lymphocyte gp90Hermes--was able to bind purified MAd. In contrast, a 140-160-kD form of the Hermes antigen isolated from squamous epithelial cells lacked this capability. Like lymphocyte binding to mucosal HEV, the interaction between glial gp90Hermes and MAd is inhibited by mAb Hermes-3, but not Hermes-1, suggesting that similar molecular domains are involved in the two binding events. The observation that the Hermes/CD44 molecules derived from several nonlymphoid cell types display binding domains homologous to those of lymphocyte homing receptors suggests that these glycoproteins represent a novel type of cell adhesion/recognition molecule (H-CAM) potentially mediating cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions in multiple tissues.",,
8530354,Monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 is a functional ligand for CC chemokine receptors 1 and 2B.,"The CC chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3) activates human monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. MCP-3 has been reported to induce [Ca2+]i changes in cells transfected with the monocyte-selective MCP-1 receptor 2B (CC CKR2B) and competes for 125I-MCP-1 binding on CC CKR2B, suggesting that it may mediate monocyte responses to MCP-3. However, we now show that MCP-3 is a ligand and potent agonist for the macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha)/regulated on activation, normal T expressed, and secreted protein (RANTES) receptor CC CKR1 (rank order for [Ca2+]i changes = MIP-1 alpha > MCP-3 > RANTES), which is expressed in monocytes > neutrophils > eosinophils. 125I-MCP-3 bound directly to CC CKR1 and CC CKR2B (Ki = 8 and 7 nM, respectively). Binding to CC CKR1 was competed by all CC chemokines tested except MCP-1. In contrast, binding to CC CKR2B was competed only by MCP-3 and MCP-1. Both MCP-1 and MCP-3 were equipotent agonists (EC50 = 10 nM for [Ca2+]i changes). Thus, MCP-3 is a functional ligand for both CC CKR1 and CC CKR2B, which otherwise have distinct selectivities for CC chemokines. These data suggest that monocyte responses to MCP-3 could be mediated by both CC CKR2B and CC CKR1, whereas eosinophil responses to MCP-3 could be mediated by CC CKR1.",,
9115216,Monocyte chemotactic protein-2 (MCP-2) uses CCR1 and CCR2B as its functional receptors.,"Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-2 is a member of the C-C chemokine subfamily, which shares more than 60% sequence homology with MCP-1 and MCP-3 and about 30% homology with macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, regulated on activation of normal T cell expressed (RANTES), and MIP-1beta. Despite this considerable sequence homology to other C-C chemokines, MCP-2 appears to have unique functional properties in comparison with other C-C chemokines such as MCP-1 and MCP-3. Although evidence obtained from studies on leukocytes suggested that MCP-2 may share the receptors with these C-C chemokines, the actual functional receptors for MCP-2 have not yet been identified. In this study, by using radioiodinated MCP-2, we identified high affinity binding sites for MCP-2 on human peripheral blood monocytes. The MCP-2 binding was competed for by MCP-1 and MCP-3, but less well by MIP-1alpha or RANTES. In experiments using cells transfected with C-C chemokine receptors, 125I-MCP-2 bound to human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with CCR1 or CCR2B, known to also bind MIP-1alpha/RANTES and MCP-1, respectively, but both shared by MCP-3. The binding of 125I-MCP-2 to these receptor-transfected cells was displaced completely by chemokines that bind to these receptors. Both CCR1- and CCR2B-transfected 293 cells showed significant migration in response to MCP-2, in addition to responding to other specific chemokines. These results clearly demonstrate that MCP-2, unlike MCP-1, uses both CCR1 as well as CCR2B as its functional receptors, and this accounts for the unique activities of MCP-2.",,
9468473,Monocyte chemotactic protein-2 activates CCR5 and blocks CD4/CCR5-mediated HIV-1 entry/replication.,"Human immunodeficiency virus, type I (HIV-1) cell-type tropism is dictated by chemokine receptor usage: T-cell line tropic viruses use CXCR4, whereas monocyte tropic viruses primarily use CCR5 as fusion coreceptors. CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) inhibit CD4/CCR5-mediated HIV-1 cell fusion. MCP-2 is also a member of the CC chemokine subfamily and has the capacity to interact with at least two receptors including CCR-1 and CCR2B. In an effort to further characterize the binding properties of MCP-2 on leukocytes, we observed that MCP-2, but not MCP-1, effectively competed with MIP-1beta for binding to monocytes, suggesting that MCP-2 may interact with CCR5. As predicted, MCP-2 competitively inhibited MIP-1beta binding to HEK293 cells stably transfected with CCR5 (CCR5/293 cells). MCP-2 also bound to and induced chemotaxis of CCR5/293 cells with a potency comparable with that of MIP-1beta. Confocal microscopy indicates that MCP-2 caused remarkable and dose-dependent internalization of CCR5 in CCR5/293 cells. Furthermore, MCP-2 inhibited the entry/replication of HIV-1ADA in CCR5/293 cells coexpressing CD4. These results indicated that MCP-2 uses CCR5 as one of its functional receptors and is an additional potent natural inhibitor of HIV-1.",,
7545673,"Monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP3) interacts with multiple leukocyte receptors. C-C CKR1, a receptor for macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha/Rantes, is also a functional receptor for MCP3.","Monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP3) is recently identified and molecularly cloned C-C chemokine that is chemotactic for and activates a great variety of inflammatory cell types. MCP3 has been reported to interact with several C-C chemokine receptors, which can be simultaneously or selectively expressed on leukocyte subpopulations. In order to isolate receptor(s) for MCP3, a cDNA library was constructed using mRNA from a human NK-like cell line, YT. These cells showed high affinity binding sites for 125I-MCP3 and migrated in response to MCP3. A chemokine receptor cDNA clone, designated YT4, was sequenced and found to be identical to the known C-C CKR1 or macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP1 alpha)/Rantes receptor. YT4 cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, and stable transfectants were prepared using the embryonic kidney cell line 293. The transfectants (YT4/293) showed high affinity binding for 125I-MCP3 in addition to specifically binding 125I-MIP1 alpha and 125I-Rantes. All three C-C chemokines were able to cross-compete for binding sites on YT4/293 cells and induced directional migration of YT4/293 cells in vitro, with MCP3 being the most potent chemoattractant. MCP3, MIP1 alpha, and Rantes were equally able to cross-attenuate the migratory response of YT4/293 cells to one another. In contrast, MCP1 and MIP1 beta had very limited capacity to compete for MCP3 binding on YT4/293 cells and had only a minor attenuating effect on MCP3-induced migration. Since MCP3 has been reported to use MCP1 receptor(s), our results with transfected 293 cells expressing only C-C CKR1 clearly establish that C-C CKR1 is also a functional receptor for MCP3.",,
8195702,Monomer-dimer equilibria of interleukin-8 and neutrophil-activating peptide 2. Evidence for IL-8 binding as a dimer and oligomer to IL-8 receptor B.,"By chemical cross-linking experiments we show that at physiologically relevant concentrations IL-8 and NAP-2 monomers are in an equilibrium with dimers and even oligomers (KD approximately 300-800 nM). Oligomerization seems to be more prevalent for IL-8 than for NAP-2. The form in which IL-8 and NAP-2 bind to their specific receptors was analyzed in binding experiments with COS-1 cells expressing IL-8 receptor A or B in recombinant forms. Both receptors were cloned from the human myeloid leukemic cell line AML-193. Type A receptor had high affinity for IL-8 (KD approximately 4 nM) and low affinity for NAP-2 (KD > or = 700 nM), whereas the type B receptor was of equally high affinity (KD approximately 2 nM) for both IL-8 and NAP-2. However, IL-8 receptor B could bind specifically three to four times more IL-8 than NAP-2, and NAP-2 was a weak competitor for IL-8 binding to the same receptor. In addition, IL-8, but not NAP-2, could be cross-linked to dimers when bound to IL-8 receptor B. We suggest from these findings that IL-8, but not NAP-2, binds as a dimer and oligomer to IL-8 receptor.",,
26885373,Monomeric annexin A2 is an oxygen-regulated toll-like receptor 2 ligand and adjuvant.,"Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a pleiotropic, calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with a broad tissue distribution. It can be intracellular, membrane-bound, or secreted, and it exists as a monomer or heterotetramer. The secreted ANXA2 heterotetramer signals human and murine macrophages to produce IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α through TLR4/MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways.",,
27174917,Monomeric gremlin is a novel vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 antagonist.,"Angiogenesis plays a key role in various physiological and pathological conditions, including inflammation and tumor growth. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist gremlin has been identified as a novel pro-angiogenic factor. Gremlin promotes neovascular responses via a BMP-independent activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (VEGFR2). BMP antagonists may act as covalent or non-covalent homodimers or in a monomeric form, while VEGFRs ligands are usually dimeric. However, the oligomeric state of gremlin and its role in modulating the biological activity of the protein remain to be elucidated.Here we show that gremlin is expressed in vitro and in vivo both as a monomer and as a covalently linked homodimer. Mutagenesis of amino acid residue Cys141 prevents gremlin dimerization leading to the formation of gremlinC141A monomers. GremlinC141A monomer retains a BMP antagonist activity similar to the wild-type dimer, but is devoid of a significant angiogenic capacity. Notably, we found that gremlinC141A mutant engages VEGFR2 in a non-productive manner, thus acting as receptor antagonist. Accordingly, both gremlinC141A and wild-type monomers inhibit angiogenesis driven by dimeric gremlin or VEGF-A165. Moreover, by acting as a VEGFR2 antagonist, gremlinC141A inhibits the angiogenic and tumorigenic potential of murine breast and prostate cancer cells in vivo.In conclusion, our data show that gremlin exists in multiple forms endowed with specific bioactivities and provide new insights into the molecular bases of gremlin dimerization. Furthermore, we propose gremlin monomer as a new inhibitor of VEGFR2 signalling during tumor growth.",,
9815261,Mouse CD94/NKG2A is a natural killer cell receptor for the nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule Qa-1(b).,"Natural killer (NK) cells preferentially lyse targets that express reduced levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins. To date, the only known mouse NK receptors for MHC class I belong to the Ly49 family of C-type lectin homodimers. Here, we report the cloning of mouse NKG2A, and demonstrate it forms an additional and distinct class I receptor, a CD94/NKG2A heterodimer. Using soluble tetramers of the nonclassical class I molecule Qa-1(b), we provide direct evidence that CD94/NKG2A recognizes Qa-1(b). We further demonstrate that NK recognition of Qa-1(b) results in the inhibition of target cell lysis. Inhibition appears to depend on the presence of Qdm, a Qa-1(b)-binding peptide derived from the signal sequences of some classical class I molecules. Mouse NKG2A maps adjacent to CD94 in the heart of the NK complex on mouse chromosome six, one of a small cluster of NKG2-like genes. Our findings suggest that mouse NK cells, like their human counterparts, use multiple mechanisms to survey class I expression on target cells.",The Journal of experimental medicine,1998
16543246,Mouse cristin/R-spondin family proteins are novel ligands for the Frizzled 8 and LRP6 receptors and activate beta-catenin-dependent gene expression.,"Wnt signaling plays critical biological roles during normal embryonic development and homeostasis in adults. In the canonical pathway, binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled (Fzd) receptor and the low density lipoprotein-related receptor (LRP) 5 or LRP6 coreceptor initiates downstream signaling events leading to gene activation by beta-catenin and the T-cell factor (TCF)-lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) family transcription factor complex. In this study, we provide several lines of evidence that the mouse Cristin/R-spondin family proteins function as Fzd8 and LRP6 receptor ligands and induce the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, leading to TCF-dependent gene activation. First, conditioned medium containing Cristin/R-spondin proteins effectively induced reporter activity in a TCF-binding site-dependent manner. Second, stimulation of cells with Cristin/R-spondin was accompanied by stabilization of endogenous beta-catenin proteins and induction of canonical Wnt target genes. Third, Cristin/R-spondin proteins physically interacted with the extracellular domains of the LRP6 and Fzd8 receptors in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, unlike canonical Wnt ligands, Cristin/R-spondin failed to form a ternary complex with both LRP6 and Fzd8 receptors, suggesting that R-spondin may activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by different mechanisms. Furthermore, Cristin/R-spondin proteins possess an intriguing positive modulatory activity on Wnt ligands, possibly through a direct interaction. Our findings expand the repertoire of ligands that induce beta-catenin/TCF-dependent gene activation and implicate the presence of active beta-catenin-dependent gene activation in a Wnt-free biological context.",,
11019817,Mouse group X secretory phospholipase A2 induces a potent release of arachidonic acid from spleen cells and acts as a ligand for the phospholipase A2 receptor.,"Group X secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-X) has recently been shown to possess a powerful potency for releasing arachidonic acid from cell membrane phospholipids. Here, we report the purification of mouse pro- and mature forms of sPLA2-X, as well as its expression and biological functions. Purified pro-sPLA2-X was found to possess a propeptide of 11 amino acid residues attached at the NH2-terminals of the mature protein, and showed as little as 8% of the PLA2 activity of the mature form. Limited proteolysis of pro-sPLA2-X with trypsin resulted in the appearance of the mature form with a concomitant increase in PLA2 activity, suggesting a requirement of proteolytic removal of the propeptide for the optimal activity. The expression of sPLA2-X mRNA was detected in various tissues including the lung, thymus, and spleen, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed its expression in splenic macrophages. In the spleen cells, mature sPLA2-X elicited a prompt release of arachidonic acid with significant production of prostaglandin E2 more efficiently than group IB and IIA sPLA2s. In addition, sPLA2-X was identified as a high-affinity ligand for both native and recombinant form of mouse PLA2 receptor (PLA2R). However, there was no significant difference in the sPLA2-X-induced arachidonic acid release responses in the spleen cells between wild-type and PLA2R-deficient mice. These findings strongly suggest that sPLA2-X possesses two distinct biological functions in mice: it elicits a marked release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids leading to the production of lipid mediators based on its enzymatic potency, and it acts as a natural ligand for the PLA2R that has been shown to play a critical role in the production of inflammatory cytokines during endotoxic shock.",,
7843232,Mouse interleukin-12 (IL-12) p40 homodimer: a potent IL-12 antagonist.,"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a cytokine that has regulatory effects on T and natural killer (NK) cells and is composed of two disulfide-bonded subunits, p40 and p35. It was recently reported that supernatants from cultures of mouse IL-12 (moIL-12) p40-transfected COS cells could inhibit IL-12-dependent responses in vitro (Mattner, F., et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 1993. 23: 2202). We have further characterized the nature of the inhibitory substance. Purified mouse p40 produced in a baculovirus expression system was found to consist of two species: the p40 monomer and a disulfide-linked p40 dimer [(p40)2]. The (p40)2 was 25- to 50-fold more active than the p40 monomer in causing specific, dose-dependent inhibition of IL-12-induced mouse concanavalin A (Con A) blast proliferation and could also inhibit IL-12-induced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion by mouse splenocytes and IL-12-dependent activation of mouse NK cells. Competitive binding studies on mouse Con A blasts showed that (p40)2 was equally effective as moIL-12 in competing with 125I-labeled moIL-12 ([125I]moIL-12) for binding to mouse Con A blasts. However, in contrast to moIL-12, mouse (p40)2 displayed little ability to compete with 125I-labeled human IL-12 (huIL-12) for binding to high-affinity IL-12 receptors (IL-12R) on human phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts and caused little or no inhibition of huIL-12-induced human PHA blast proliferation. Nonetheless, mouse (p40)2 was equally effective as moIL-12 in competing with [125I] huIL-12 for binding to COS cells transfected with the human IL-12R beta subunit and expressing low-affinity IL-12 binding sites. These results suggest that (i) the majority of the structural determinants required for binding of IL-12 to its receptor are contained within the p40 subunit, but p35 is required for signaling, (ii) the p40 subunit of IL-12 interacts with the beta subunit of IL-12R, and (iii) (p40)2 may be a suitable IL-12 antagonist for studying the role of IL-12 in various immune responses in vivo as well as in vitro. Further studies are required to determine whether or not (p40)2 is produced by normal lymphoid cells and is a physiologic regulator of IL-12 activity.",,
10551863,Mouse jagged1 physically interacts with notch2 and other notch receptors. Assessment by quantitative methods.,"The Delta/Serrate/LAG-2 (DSL) domain containing proteins are considered to be ligands for Notch receptors. However, the physical interaction between DSL proteins and Notch receptors is poorly understood. In this study, we cloned a cDNA for mouse Jagged1 (mJagged1). To identify the receptor interacting with mJagged1 and to gain insight into its binding characteristics, we established two experimental systems using fusion proteins comprising various extracellular parts of mJagged1, a ""cell"" binding assay and a ""solid-phase"" binding assay. mJagged1 physically bound to mouse Notch2 (mNotch2) on the cell surface and to a purified extracellular portion of mNotch2, respectively, in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Scatchard analysis of mJagged1 binding to BaF3 cells and to the soluble Notch2 protein demonstrated dissociation constants of 0.4 and 0.7 nM, respectively, and that the number of mJagged1-binding sites on BaF3 is 5,548 per cell. Furthermore, deletion mutant analyses showed that the DSL domain of mJagged1 is a minimal binding unit and is indispensable for binding to mNotch2. The epidermal growth factor-like repeats of mJagged1 modulate the affinity of the interaction, with the first and second repeats playing a major role. Finally, solid-phase binding assay showed that Jagged1 binds to Notch1 and Notch3 in addition to Notch2, suggesting that mJagged1 is a ligand for multiple Notch receptors.",,
9686597,"Mouse MD-1, a molecule that is physically associated with RP105 and positively regulates its expression.","RP105 is a leucine-rich repeat molecule that is expressed on mouse B cells and transmits a growth-promoting signal. An anti-RP105 Ab precipitated additional molecules as well as RP105. These molecules were found to be a mouse homologue of chicken MD-1. Chicken MD-1 was previously isolated as a v-myb-regulated gene, since its transcription increases rapidly after v-myb induction. Mouse MD-1, when transiently expressed as an epitope-tagged protein, is secreted in culture fluid but tethered to the cell surface by coexpressed RP105. An association of these molecules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-RP105 Ab and subsequent probing of the epitope tag on MD-1. Moreover, MD-1 has an effect on the expression of RP105. In transient transfection of RP105, the percentage of RP105-positive cells increased more than twice with the coexpression of MD-1. The stable expression of MD-1 conferred approximately a sevenfold increase in cell surface RP105 on a cell line that expresses RP105 alone. Thus, MD-1 is physically associated with RP105 and is important for efficient cell surface expression.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1998
30659055,Mouse PVRIG Has CD8,"A limitation to antitumor immunity is the dysfunction of T cells in the tumor microenvironment, in part due to upregulation of coinhibitory receptors such as PD-1. Here, we describe that poliovirus receptor-related immunoglobulin domain protein (PVRIG) acts as a coinhibitory receptor in mice. Murine PVRIG interacted weakly with poliovirus receptor (PVR) but bound poliovirus receptor-like 2 (PVRL2) strongly, making the latter its principal ligand. As in humans, murine NK and NKT cells constitutively expressed PVRIG. However, when compared with humans, less PVRIG transcript and surface protein was detected in murine CD8",Cancer immunology research,2019
12915402,MrgX2 is a high potency cortistatin receptor expressed in dorsal root ganglion.,"MrgX2 is a recently identified orphan G-protein-coupled receptor whose ligand and physiological function were unknown. Here we describe cortistatin, a neuropeptide for which no specific receptor has been identified previously, as a high potency ligand at MrgX2. Cortistatin has several biological functions including roles in sleep regulation, locomotor activity, and cortical function. Using a ""reverse pharmacology"" approach, we have identified a number of additional cyclic peptide agonists for MrgX2, determined their rank order of potency, and demonstrated that this receptor has a pharmacological profile distinct from the other characterized members of the Mrg (Mas-related genes) family. In MrgX2-expressing cells, cortistatin-stimulated increases in intracellular Ca2+ but had no effect on basal or forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels, suggesting that this receptor is Gq-coupled. Immunohistochemical and quantitative PCR studies show MrgX2 to have a limited expression profile, both peripheral and within the central nervous system, with highest levels in dorsal root ganglion.",,
17767165,"Mrp8 and Mrp14 are endogenous activators of Toll-like receptor 4, promoting lethal, endotoxin-induced shock.","To identify new components that regulate the inflammatory cascade during sepsis, we characterized the functions of myeloid-related protein-8 (Mrp8, S100A8) and myeloid-related protein-14 (Mrp14, S100A9), two abundant cytoplasmic proteins of phagocytes. We now demonstrate that mice lacking Mrp8-Mrp14 complexes are protected from endotoxin-induced lethal shock and Escherichia coli-induced abdominal sepsis. Both proteins are released during activation of phagocytes, and Mrp8-Mrp14 complexes amplify the endotoxin-triggered inflammatory responses of phagocytes. Mrp8 is the active component that induces intracellular translocation of myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 and activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB, resulting in elevated expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Using phagocytes expressing a nonfunctional Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), HEK293 cells transfected with TLR4, CD14 and MD2, and by surface plasmon resonance studies in vitro, we demonstrate that Mrp8 specifically interacts with the TLR4-MD2 complex, thus representing an endogenous ligand of TLR4. Therefore Mrp8-Mrp14 complexes are new inflammatory components that amplify phagocyte activation during sepsis upstream of TNFalpha-dependent effects.",,
23444378,Multi-functional norrin is a ligand for the LGR4 receptor.,"Mammalian LGR4, 5 and 6 are seven-transmembrane receptors that are important for diverse physiological processes. These receptors are orthologous to DLGR2, a Drosophila receptor activated by the burs/pburs heterodimer important for morphogenesis. Although recent studies indicated that four R-spondin proteins are cognate ligands for LGR4, 5 and 6 receptors, several BMP antagonists in vertebrates have been postulated to be orthologous to burs and pburs. Using newly available genome sequences, we showed that norrin is a vertebrate ortholog for insect burs and pburs and stimulates Wnt signaling mediated by LGR4, but not by LGR5 and 6, in mammalian cells. Although norrin could only activate LGR4, binding studies suggested interactions between norrin and LGR4, 5 and 6. Norrin, the Norrie disease gene product, is also capable of activating Wnt signaling mediated by the Frizzled4 receptor and serves as a BMP antagonist. Mutagenesis studies indicated that different norrin mutations found in patients with Norrie disease can be categorized into subgroups according to defects for signaling through the three distinct binding proteins. Thus, norrin is a rare ligand capable of binding three receptors/binding proteins that are important for BMP and Wnt signaling pathways.",,
28671670,"Multimerin-2 is a ligand for group 14 family C-type lectins CLEC14A, CD93 and CD248 spanning the endothelial pericyte interface.","The C-type lectin domain containing group 14 family members CLEC14A and CD93 are proteins expressed by endothelium and are implicated in tumour angiogenesis. CD248 (alternatively known as endosialin or tumour endothelial marker-1) is also a member of this family and is expressed by tumour-associated fibroblasts and pericytes. Multimerin-2 (MMRN2) is a unique endothelial specific extracellular matrix protein that has been implicated in angiogenesis and tumour progression. We show that the group 14 C-type lectins CLEC14A, CD93 and CD248 directly bind to MMRN2 and only thrombomodulin of the family does not. Binding to MMRN2 is dependent on a predicted long-loop region in the C-type lectin domain and is abrogated by mutation within the domain. CLEC14A and CD93 bind to the same non-glycosylated coiled-coil region of MMRN2, but the binding of CD248 occurs on a distinct non-competing region. CLEC14A and CD248 can bind MMRN2 simultaneously and this occurs at the interface between endothelium and pericytes in human pancreatic cancer. A recombinant peptide of MMRN2 spanning the CLEC14A and CD93 binding region blocks CLEC14A extracellular domain binding to the endothelial cell surface as well as increasing adherence of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to the active peptide. This MMRN2 peptide is anti-angiogenic in vitro and reduces tumour growth in mouse models. These findings identify novel protein interactions involving CLEC14A, CD93 and CD248 with MMRN2 as targetable components of vessel formation.",,
10385705,Multiple amylin receptors arise from receptor activity-modifying protein interaction with the calcitonin receptor gene product.,"Receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) are single-transmembrane proteins that transport the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) to the cell surface. RAMP 1-transported CRLR is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor. RAMP 2- or RAMP 3-transported CRLR is an adrenomedullin receptor. The role of RAMPs beyond their interaction with CRLR, a class II G protein-coupled receptor, is unclear. In this study, we have examined the role of RAMPs in generating amylin receptor phenotypes from the calcitonin (CT) receptor gene product. Cotransfection of RAMP 1 or RAMP 3 with the human CT receptor lacking the 16-amino acid insert in intracellular domain 1 (hCTRI1-) into COS-7 cells induced specific 125I-labeled rat amylin binding. RAMP 2 or vector cotransfection did not cause significant increases in specific amylin binding. Competition-binding characterization of the RAMP-induced amylin receptors revealed two distinct phenotypes. The RAMP 1-derived amylin receptor demonstrated the highest affinity for salmon CT (IC50, 3.01 +/- 1.44 x 10(-10) M), a high to moderate affinity for rat amylin (IC50, 7.86 +/- 4.49 x 10(-9) M) and human CGRPalpha (IC50, 2.09 +/- 1.63 x 10(-8) M), and a low affinity for human CT (IC50, 4.47 +/- 0.78 x 10(-7) M). In contrast, whereas affinities for amylin and the CTs were similar for the RAMP 3-derived receptor, the efficacy of human CGRPalpha was markedly reduced (IC50, 1.12 +/- 0.45 x 10(-7) M; P <.05 versus RAMP 1). Functional cyclic AMP responses in COS-7 cells cotransfected with individual RAMPs and hCTRI1- were reflective of the phenotypes seen in competition for amylin binding. Confocal microscopic localization of c-myc-tagged RAMP 1 indicated that, when transfected alone, RAMP 1 almost exclusively was located intracellularly. Cotransfection with calcitonin receptor (CTR)I1- induced cell surface expression of RAMP 1. The results of experiments cross-linking 125I-labeled amylin to RAMP 1/hCTR-transfected cells with bis succidimidyl suberate were suggestive of a cell-surface association of RAMP 1 and the receptors. Our data suggest that in the CT family of receptors, and potentially in other class II G protein-coupled receptors, the cellular phenotype is likely to be dynamic in regard to the level and combination of both the receptor and the RAMP proteins.",,
15649866,Multiple binding sites revealed by interaction of relaxin family peptides with native and chimeric relaxin family peptide receptors 1 and 2 (LGR7 and LGR8).,"Relaxin family peptide 1 (RXFP1) receptor (LGR7) and RXFP2 receptor (LGR8) were recently identified as the receptor targets for H2 relaxin and insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), respectively. In this study, we define the pharmacology of these two receptors by using a number of receptor chimeras and relaxin family peptides. We have identified two binding sites on these receptors: one primary, high-affinity site within the ectodomain and a secondary, lower affinity site within the transmembrane region. The primary site was found to dictate receptor binding characteristics, although the lower affinity site also exerts some influence and modulates ligand affinity for the primary site in a manner dependent upon the peptide in question. Not all relaxin peptides were able to bind to the RXFP2 receptor, indicating that the relaxin-RXFP2 receptor interaction is species-specific. INSL3 was found to exhibit characteristics of a partial agonist at the RXFP2 and chimeric RXFP1/2 receptors, with low maximal cAMP responses but high potency in coupling to this pathway. cAMP accumulation studies also revealed that the binding sites couple to cAMP signaling pathways with differing efficiency: the high-affinity site signals with high efficiency, whereas the lower affinity site signals with little to no efficiency. Comparisons between RXFP1, RXFP2, the chimeric receptors, and the truncated receptors revealed that the interaction between receptor sites is critical for optimal ligand binding and signal transduction and that the ectodomain is essential for signaling. Evidence obtained in this study supports a two-stage binding model of receptor activation: binding to the primary site allows a conformational change and interaction with the low-affinity transmembrane site.",,
28913673,Multiple non-catalytic ADAMs are novel integrin α4 ligands.,"The ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) protein family uniquely exhibits both catalytic and adhesive properties. In the well-defined process of ectodomain shedding, ADAMs transform latent, cell-bound substrates into soluble, biologically active derivatives to regulate a spectrum of normal and pathological processes. In contrast, the integrin ligand properties of ADAMs are not fully understood. Emerging models posit that ADAM-integrin interactions regulate shedding activity by localizing or sequestering the ADAM sheddase. Interestingly, 8 of the 21 human ADAMs are predicted to be catalytically inactive. Unlike their catalytically active counterparts, integrin recognition of these ""dead"" enzymes has not been largely reported. The present study delineates the integrin ligand properties of a group of non-catalytic ADAMs. Here we report that human ADAM11, ADAM23, and ADAM29 selectively support integrin α4-dependent cell adhesion. This is the first demonstration that the disintegrin-like domains of multiple catalytically inactive ADAMs are ligands for a select subset of integrin receptors that also recognize catalytically active ADAMs.",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,2018
9405670,Multiple receptors for HLA-G on human natural killer cells.,"HLA-G is the putative natural killer (NK) cell inhibitory ligand expressed on the extravillous cytotrophoblast of the human placenta. Killing of the class I negative human B cell line 721.221 by NK cells is inhibited by the expression of HLA-G. This inhibition is dependent on a high level of HLA-G expression. In the present study, the nature of the receptors that mediate the inhibition has been studied with 140 NK cell lines from two donors and 246 NK clones from 5 donors by blocking the inhibition using monoclonal antibodies against the known NK inhibitory receptors: CD158a, CD158b, and CD94. Both CD94 and the two CD158 proteins can function as receptors, although the former clearly predominates. In many cases, a combination of antibodies to these receptors is required to achieve maximal reversal of inhibition. Moreover, in at least one-third of the NK cells that are inhibited by HLA-G, these antibodies alone or in combination do not reverse inhibition, strongly suggesting the existence of a third major unidentified receptor for HLA-G.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1997
9482662,Multiple regions of ligand discrimination revealed by analysis of chimeric parathyroid hormone 2 (PTH2) and PTH/PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) receptors.,"PTH and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) bind to the PTH/PTHrP receptor and stimulate cAMP accumulation with similar efficacy. Only PTH activates the PTH2 receptor. To examine the structural basis for this selectivity, we analyzed receptor chimeras in which the amino terminus and third extracellular domains of the two receptors were interchanged. All chimeric receptors bound radiolabeled PTH with high affinity. Transfer of the PTH2 receptor amino terminus to the PTH/PTHrP receptor eliminated high-affinity PTHrP binding and significantly decreased activation by PTHrP. A PTH/PTHrP receptor N terminus modified by deletion of the nonhomologous E2 domain transferred weak PTHrP interaction to the PTH2 receptor. Introduction of the PTH2 receptor third extracellular loop into the PTH/PTHrP receptor increased the EC50 for PTH and PTHrP, while preserving high-affinity PTH binding and eliminating high-affinity PTHrP binding. Similarly, transfer of the PTH/PTHrP receptor third extracellular loop preserved high-affinity PTH binding by the PTH2 receptor but decreased its activation. Return of Gln440 and Arg394, corresponding residues in the PTH/PTHrP and PTH2 receptor third extracellular loops, to the parent residue restored function of these receptors. Simultaneous interchange of wild-type amino termini and third extracellular loops eliminated agonist activation but not binding for both receptors. Function was restored by elimination of the E2 domain in the receptor with a PTH/PTHrP receptor N terminus and return of Gln440/Arg394 to the parent sequence in both receptors. These data suggest that the amino terminus and third extracellular loop of the PTH2 and PTH/PTHrP receptors interact similarly with PTH, and that both domains contribute to differential interaction with PTHrP.",,
21454693,"Murine insulin growth factor-like (IGFL) and human IGFL1 proteins are induced in inflammatory skin conditions and bind to a novel tumor necrosis factor receptor family member, IGFLR1.","Psoriasis is a human skin condition characterized by epidermal hyperproliferation and infiltration of multiple leukocyte populations. In characterizing a novel insulin growth factor (IGF)-like (IGFL) gene in mice (mIGFL), we found transcripts of this gene to be most highly expressed in skin with enhanced expression in models of skin wounding and psoriatic-like inflammation. A possible functional ortholog in humans, IGFL1, was uniquely and significantly induced in psoriatic skin samples. In vitro IGFL1 expression was up-regulated in cultured primary keratinocytes stimulated with tumor necrosis factor α but not by other psoriasis-associated cytokines. Finally, using a secreted and transmembrane protein library, we discovered high affinity interactions between human IGFL1 and mIGFL and the TMEM149 ectodomain. TMEM149 (renamed here as IGFLR1) is an uncharacterized gene with structural similarity to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. Our studies demonstrate that IGFLR1 is expressed primarily on the surface of mouse T cells. The connection between mIGFL and IGFLR1 receptor suggests mIGFL may influence T cell biology within inflammatory skin conditions.",,
11518718,Murine notch homologs (N1-4) undergo presenilin-dependent proteolysis.,"Oncogenic forms of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4 appear to mimic signaling intermediates of Notch1 and suggest that the role of proteolysis in Notch signaling has been conserved. Here we demonstrate that extracellularly truncated Notch homologs are substrates for a presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase activity. Despite minimal conservation within the transmembrane domain, the requirement for a specific amino acid (P1' valine) and its position at the cleavage site relative to the cytosolic border of the transmembrane domain are preserved. Cleaved, untethered Notch intracellular domains from each receptor translocate to the nucleus and interact with the transcriptional regulatory protein CSL. All four Notch proteins display presenilin-dependent transactivating potential on a minimal promoter reporter. Thus, this study increases the number of biochemically characterized gamma-secretase substrates from two to five. Despite a high degree of structural homology and the presenilin-dependent activity of truncated Notch proteins, the extent that this reflects functional redundancy is unknown.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
15159418,MuSK is required for anchoring acetylcholinesterase at the neuromuscular junction.,"At the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is mainly present as asymmetric forms in which tetramers of catalytic subunits are associated to a specific collagen, collagen Q (ColQ). The accumulation of the enzyme in the synaptic basal lamina strictly relies on ColQ. This has been shown to be mediated by interaction between ColQ and perlecan, which itself binds dystroglycan. Here, using transfected mutants of ColQ in a ColQ-deficient muscle cell line or COS-7 cells, we report that ColQ clusterizes through a more complex mechanism. This process requires two heparin-binding sites contained in the collagen domain as well as the COOH terminus of ColQ. Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments in Torpedo postsynaptic membranes together with transfection experiments with muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) constructs in MuSK-deficient myotubes or COS-7 cells provide the first evidence that ColQ binds MuSK. Together, our data suggest that a ternary complex containing ColQ, perlecan, and MuSK is required for AChE clustering and support the notion that MuSK dictates AChE synaptic localization at the neuromuscular junction.",The Journal of cell biology,2004
15131125,Mutants of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 designed to inhibit neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are more effective in vivo than their endogenous inhibitors.,"Neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are abundant intracellular neutrophil proteinases that have an important role in destroying ingested particles. However, when neutrophils degranulate, these proteinases are released and can cause irreparable damage by degrading host connective tissue proteins. Despite abundant endogenous inhibitors, these proteinases are protected from inhibition because of their ability to bind to anionic surfaces. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), which is not an inhibitor of these proteinases, possesses properties that could make it an effective inhibitor of neutrophil proteinases if its specificity could be redirected. PAI-1 efficiently inhibits surface-sequestered proteinases, and it efficiently mediates rapid cellular clearance of PAI-1-proteinase complexes. Therefore, we examined whether PAI-1 could be engineered to inhibit and clear neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. By introducing specific mutations in the reactive center loop of wild-type PAI-1, we generated PAI-1 mutants that are effective inhibitors of both proteinases. Kinetic analysis shows that the inhibition of neutrophil proteinases by these PAI-1 mutants is not affected by the sequestration of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G onto surfaces. In addition, complexes of these proteinases and PAI-1 mutants are endocytosed and degraded by lung epithelial cells more efficiently than either the neutrophil proteinases alone or in complex with their physiological inhibitors, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor and alpha1-antichymotrypsin. Finally, the PAI-1 mutants were more effective in reducing the neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G activities in an in vivo model of lung inflammation than were their physiological inhibitors.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2004
12081481,"Mutating the four extracellular cysteines in the chemokine receptor CCR6 reveals their differing roles in receptor trafficking, ligand binding, and signaling.","CCR6 is the receptor for the chemokine MIP-3 alpha/CCL20. Almost all chemokine receptors contain cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain and in the first, second, and third extracellular loops. In this report, we have studied the importance of all cysteine residues in the CCR6 sequence using site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical techniques. Like all G protein-coupled receptors, mutating disulfide bond-forming cysteines in the first (Cys118) and second (Cys197) extracellular loops in CCR6 led to complete elimination of receptor activity, which for CCR6 was also associated with the accumulation of the receptor intracellularly. Although two additional cysteines in the N-terminal region and the third extracellular loop, which are present in almost all chemokine receptors, are presumed to form a disulfide bond, this has not been demonstrated experimentally for any of these receptors. We found that mutating the cysteines in the N-terminal domain (Cys36) and the third extracellular loop (Cys288) neither significantly affected receptor surface expression nor completely abolished receptor function. Importantly, contrary to several previous reports, we demonstrated directly that instead of forming a disulfide bond, the N-terminal cysteine (Cys36) and the third extracellular loop cysteine (Cys288) contain free SH groups. The cysteine residues (Cys36 and Cys288), rather than forming a disulfide bond, may be important per se. We propose that CCR6 forms only a disulfide bond between the first (Cys118) and second (Cys197) extracellular loops, which confines a helical bundle together with the N-terminus adjacent to the third extracellular loop, creating the structural organization critical for ligand binding and therefore for receptor signaling.",Biochemistry,2002
2550426,Mutation of the high cysteine region of the human insulin receptor alpha-subunit increases insulin receptor binding affinity and transmembrane signaling.,"Our previous studies indicated that amino acid residues 240-250 in the cysteine-rich region of the human insulin receptor alpha-subunit constitute a site in which insulin binds (Yip, C. C., Hsu, H., Patel, R. G., Hawley, D. M., Maddux, B. A., and Goldfine, I. D. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 157, 321-329). We have now constructed a human insulin receptor mutant in which 3 residues in this sequence were altered (Thr-Cys-Pro-Pro-Pro-Tyr-Tyr-His-Phe-Gln-Asp to Thr-Cys-Pro-Arg-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Asp-Phe-Gln-Asp) and have expressed this mutant in rat hepatoma (HTC) cells. When compared with cells transfected with normal insulin receptors, cells transfected with mutant receptors had an increase in insulin-binding affinity and a decrease in the dissociation of bound 125I-insulin. Studies using solubilized receptors also demonstrated that mutant receptors had a higher binding affinity than normal receptors. In contrast, cells transfected with either mutant or normal receptors bound monoclonal antibodies against the receptor alpha-subunit with equal affinity. When receptor tyrosine kinase activity and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake were measured, cells transfected with mutant insulin receptors were more sensitive to insulin than cells transfected with normal receptors. These findings lend further support therefore to the hypothesis that amino acid sequence 240-250 of the human insulin receptor alpha-subunit constitutes one site that interacts with insulin, and they indicate that mutations in this site can influence insulin receptor binding and transmembrane signaling.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1989
27875312,Mutational Analysis of Atypical Chemokine Receptor 3 (ACKR3/CXCR7) Interaction with Its Chemokine Ligands CXCL11 and CXCL12.,"Atypical chemokine receptors do not mediate chemotaxis or G protein signaling, but they recruit arrestin. They also efficiently scavenge their chemokine ligands, thereby contributing to gradient maintenance and termination. ACKR3, also known as CXCR7, binds and degrades the constitutive chemokine CXCL12, which also binds the canonical receptor CXCR4, and CXCL11, which also binds CXCR3. Here we report comprehensive mutational analysis of the ACKR3 interaction with its chemokine ligands, using 30 substitution mutants. Readouts are radioligand binding competition, arrestin recruitment, and chemokine scavenging. Our results suggest different binding modes for both chemokines. CXCL11 depends on the ACKR3 N terminus and some extracellular loop (ECL) positions for primary binding, ECL residues mediate secondary binding and arrestin recruitment potency. CXCL12 binding required key residues Asp-179",,
12588872,Mutations in autolytic loop-2 and at Asp554 of human prothrombin that enhance protein C activation by meizothrombin.,"Thrombin acts on many protein substrates during the hemostatic process. Its specificity for these substrates is modulated through interactions at regions remote from the active site of the thrombin molecule, designated exosites. Exosite interactions can be with the substrate, cofactors such as thrombomodulin, or fragments from prothrombin. The relative activity of alpha-thrombin for fibrinogen is 10 times greater than that for protein C. However, the relative activity of meizothrombin for protein C is 14 times greater than that for fibrinogen. Modulation of thrombin specificity is linked to its Na(+)-binding site and residues in autolytic loop-2 that interact with the Na(+)-binding site. Recombinant prothrombins that yield recombinant meizothrombin (rMT) and rMT des-fragment 1 (rMT(desF1)) enable comparisons of the effects of mutations at the Na(+)-binding residue (Asp(554)) and deletion of loop-2 (Glu(466)-Thr(469)) on the relative activity of meizothrombin for several substrates. Hydrolysis of t-butoxycarbonyl-VPR-p-nitroanilide by alpha-thrombin, recombinant alpha-thrombin, or rMT(desF1) was almost identical, but that by rMT was only 40% of that by alpha-thrombin. Clotting of fibrinogen by rMT and rMT(desF1) was 12-16% of that by alpha-thrombin, as already known. Strikingly, however, although meizothrombins modified by substitution of Asp(554) with either Ala or Leu or by deletion of loop-2 had 6-8 and <1%, respectively, of the clotting activity of alpha-thrombin, the activity of these meizothrombins for protein C was increased to >10 times that of alpha-thrombin. It is proposed that interactions within thrombin that involve autolytic loop-2 and the Na(+)-binding site primarily enhance thrombin action on fibrinogen, but impair thrombin action on protein C.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
21665003,Mutations in Frizzled 6 cause isolated autosomal-recessive nail dysplasia.,"Inherited and isolated nail malformations are rare and heterogeneous conditions. We identified two consanguineous pedigrees in which some family members were affected by isolated nail dysplasia that suggested an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern and was characterized by claw-shaped nails, onychauxis, and onycholysis. Genome-wide SNP array analysis of affected individuals from both families showed an overlapping and homozygous region of 800 kb on the long arm of chromosome 8. The candidate region spans eight genes, and DNA sequence analysis revealed homozygous nonsense and missense mutations in FZD(6), the gene encoding Frizzled 6. FZD(6) belongs to a family of highly conserved membrane-bound WNT receptors involved in developmental processes and differentiation through several signaling pathways. We expressed the FZD(6) missense mutation and observed a quantitative shift in subcellular distribution from the plasma membrane to the lysosomes, where the receptor is inaccessible for signaling and presumably degraded. Analysis of human fibroblasts homozygous for the nonsense mutation showed an aberrant response to both WNT-3A and WNT-5A stimulation; this response was consistent with an effect on both canonical and noncanonical WNT-FZD signaling. A detailed analysis of the Fzd(6)(-/-) mice, previously shown to have an altered hair pattern, showed malformed claws predominantly of the hind limbs. Furthermore, a transient Fdz6 mRNA expression was observed in the epidermis of the digital tips at embryonic day 16.5 during early claw morphogenesis. Thus, our combined results show that FZD6 mutations can result in severe defects in nail and claw formation through reduced or abolished membranous FZD(6) levels and several nonfunctional WNT-FZD pathways.",,
24056717,Mutations in genes encoding the cadherin receptor-ligand pair DCHS1 and FAT4 disrupt cerebral cortical development.,"The regulated proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells before the generation and migration of neurons in the cerebral cortex are central aspects of mammalian development. Periventricular neuronal heterotopia, a specific form of mislocalization of cortical neurons, can arise from neuronal progenitors that fail to negotiate aspects of these developmental processes. Here we show that mutations in genes encoding the receptor-ligand cadherin pair DCHS1 and FAT4 lead to a recessive syndrome in humans that includes periventricular neuronal heterotopia. Reducing the expression of Dchs1 or Fat4 within mouse embryonic neuroepithelium increased progenitor cell numbers and reduced their differentiation into neurons, resulting in the heterotopic accumulation of cells below the neuronal layers in the neocortex, reminiscent of the human phenotype. These effects were countered by concurrent knockdown of Yap, a transcriptional effector of the Hippo signaling pathway. These findings implicate Dchs1 and Fat4 upstream of Yap as key regulators of mammalian neurogenesis.",Nature genetics,2013
12601009,"Mutations in the immunoglobulin-like domain of gp190, the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor, increase or decrease its affinity for LIF.","The leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor comprises the low affinity binding chain gp190 and the high affinity converter gp130. The ectodomain of gp190 is among the most complex in the hematopoietin receptor family, because it contains two typical cytokine receptor homology domains separated by an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain. Human and murine gp190 proteins share 76% homology, but murine gp190 binds human LIF with a much higher affinity, a property attributed to the Ig-like domain. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the Ig-like domain, we mapped a LIF binding site at its carboxyl terminus, mainly involving residue Phe-328. Mutation of selected residues into their orthologs in the murine receptor (Q251E and N321D) significantly increased the affinity for human LIF. Interestingly, these residues, although localized at both the amino and carboxyl terminus, make a spatially unique LIF binding site in a structural model of the Ig-like module. These results demonstrate definitively the role of the Ig-like domain in LIF binding and the potential to modulate receptor affinity in this family with very limited amino acid changes.",,
17057721,Mutual activation of natural killer cells and monocytes mediated by NKp80-AICL interaction.,"Receptors encoded by the natural killer (NK) cell gene complex (such as NKG2D) govern the reactivity of NK cells. However, the function and ligand(s) of the NK cell gene complex-encoded human NK cell receptor NKp80 remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that NKp80 binds to the genetically linked 'orphan' receptor AICL, which, like NKp80, is absent from rodents. We defined AICL as a myeloid-specific activating receptor that is upregulated by Toll-like receptor stimulation. AICL-NKp80 interactions promoted NK cell-mediated cytolysis of malignant myeloid cells. In addition, during crosstalk between NK cells and monocytes, NKp80 stimulated the release of proinflammatory cytokines from both cell types. Thus, by specifically bridging NK cells and myeloid cells, NKp80-AICL interactions may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of immune responses at sites of inflammation.",,
12196561,Myelin proteolipid protein forms a complex with integrins and may participate in integrin receptor signaling in oligodendrocytes.,"Myelination of axons in the CNS by oligodendrocytes is a process critical to rapid and efficient impulse conduction. A new role for the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), the most abundant protein of CNS myelin, has been identified, in studies showing PLP interaction with signaling proteins in oligodendrocytes. In particular, these studies suggest that the PLP protein may be involved in signaling through integrins in oligodendrocytes. Stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on oligodendrocytes induced formation of a tripartite complex containing PLP, calreticulin, and alpha(v)-integrin. PLP interacted directly with the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha(v)-integrin. Complex formation was mediated by phospholipase C and Ca2+ binding to the high affinity binding site on calreticulin. This complex appears important for binding of fibronectin to oligodendrocytes. These data establish a novel function for PLP as a part of the integrin signaling complex in oligodendrocytes and suggest that neurotransmitter-mediated integrin receptor signaling may be involved in myelinogenesis.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2002
26329314,Myeloid-related protein 8 induces self-tolerance and cross-tolerance to bacterial infection via TLR4- and TLR2-mediated signal pathways.,"Myeloid-related protein 8 (Mrp8) is the active component of Mrp8/14 protein complex released by phagocytes at the site of infection and stimulates inflammatory responses. However, it is unclear whether Mrp8 could induce self-tolerance and cross-tolerance to bacterial infection. Here we report that Mrp8 triggered TNF-α and IL-6 release via a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent manner. Pre-stimulation of murine macrophages and human monocytes with Mrp8 induced self-tolerance to Mrp8 re-stimulation and cross-tolerance to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacterial lipoprotein (BLP), gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial challenges, with substantially attenuated TNF-α and IL-6 release. Moreover, Mrp8 tolerisation significantly reduced serum TNF-α and IL-6, increased polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) recruitment and accelerated bacterial clearance, thus protecting mice against LPS-induced lethality and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced polymicrobial sepsis. In addition to TLR4, TLR2 also contributed to Mrp8-induced inflammatory response and tolerance. Down-regulation of phosphorylated p38 by Mrp8 pre-stimulation was predominantly responsible for the intracellular mechanism of Mrp8-induced tolerance. Thus, our findings of Mrp8-induced self-tolerance and cross-tolerance may provide a potential strategy for attenuating an overwhelming proinflammatory cascade and enhancing antimicrobial responses during microbial sepsis.",,
19188438,Myocilin is a modulator of Wnt signaling.,"It is well documented that mutations in the MYOCILIN gene may lead to juvenile- and adult-onset primary open-angle glaucoma. However, the functions of wild-type myocilin are still not well understood. To study the functions of human myocilin and its two proteolytic fragments, these proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells. Conditioned medium from myocilin-expressing cells, as well as purified myocilin, induced the formation of stress fibers in primary cultures of human trabecular meshwork or NIH 3T3 cells. Stress fiber-inducing activity of myocilin was blocked by antibodies against myocilin, as well as secreted inhibitors of Wnt signaling, secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) or sFRP3, and beta-catenin small interfering RNA. Interaction of myocilin with sFRP1, sFRP3, and several Frizzled receptors was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments and by binding of myocilin to the surface of cells expressing cysteine-rich domains of different Frizzled and sFRPs. Treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with myocilin and its fragments induced intracellular redistribution of beta-catenin and its accumulation on the cellular membrane but did not induce nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin. Overexpression of myocilin in the eye angle tissues of transgenic mice stimulated accumulation of beta-catenin in these tissues. Myocilin and Wnt proteins may perform redundant functions in the mammalian eye, since myocilin modulates Wnt signaling by interacting with components of this signaling pathway.",Molecular and cellular biology,2009

11163076,N-linked carbohydrate on human leukocyte antigen-C and recognition by natural killer cell inhibitory receptors.,"The possible role of carbohydrate in the interaction of HLA-C with a human inhibitory natural Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor with two Ig domains, KIR2DL1, was investigated. Transfectants of 721.221 (a class I MHC-negative human B cell line) expressing only HLA-Cw4 or -Cw6 or their respective non-glycosylated mutants (N86Q, S88A) were made. The binding of a KIR2DL1-Ig fusion protein to the non-glycosylated mutant HLA-Cw4- or -Cw6-expressing cells was markedly decreased compared to the wild type-expressing cells. The ability to induce an inhibitory signal in the NK tumor line YTS transfected with KIR2DL1 was also impaired in the nonglycosylated mutant expressing cells. Furthermore, in a second functional assay, mutant HLA-Cw4 and -Cw6 molecules had impaired ability to induce signal transduction in BW cells expressing a KIR2DL1-CD3 zeta chain chimeric protein. Thus, the deletion of the N-linked glycosylation signal in HLA-Cw4 and -Cw6 greatly reduced recognition by KIR2DL1. Alternative interpretations of the data are discussed.",Human immunology,2000
8344959,N-syndecan (syndecan 3) from neonatal rat brain binds basic fibroblast growth factor.,"The cell surface proteoglycan N-syndecan (syndecan 3) was isolated from neonatal rat brain. Purified brain N-syndecan had biochemical properties very similar to N-syndecan previously identified in Schwann cells: it contained mainly, if not exclusively, heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains and had a core protein with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. We examined the interactions between purified N-syndecan and extracellular ligands using a solid phase binding assay. It was found that among all proteins tested, including a variety growth factors and extracellular matrix molecules, only basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) exhibited significant N-syndecan binding. N-syndecan binding to bFGF was saturable and exhibited a KD = 0.5 nM. Soluble bFGF effectively competed with immobilized bFGF for binding to N-syndecan, indicating that these two proteins also interact in solution. Heparin and heparan sulfate, but not chondroitin sulfate, inhibited N-syndecan-bFGF binding. Isolated N-syndecan core protein did not exhibit significant binding to bFGF. Thus, the heparan sulfate chains of N-syndecan, rather than its core protein, appear to be responsible for binding to bFGF. Interestingly, acidic fibroblast growth factor, which is structurally similar to bFGF, did not exhibit significant N-syndecan binding. N-syndecan also did not bind to several other heparin-binding proteins used in this study, indicating a high degree of specificity for the N-syndecan-bFGF interaction. Both N-syndecan and bFGF are abundant in neonatal brain, suggesting that N-syndecan may function as a co-receptor for bFGF during nerve tissue development.",,
9712844,N-terminal peptides of stromal cell-derived factor-1 with CXC chemokine receptor 4 agonist and antagonist activities.,"Peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 9 residues of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) have SDF-1 activity. SDF-1, 1-8, 1-9, 1-9 dimer, and 1-17 induced intracellular calcium and chemotaxis in T lymphocytes and CEM cells and bound to CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). The peptides had similar activities to SDF-1 but were less potent. Whereas native SDF-1 had half-maximal chemoattractant activity at 5 nM, the 1-9 dimer required 500 nM and was therefore 100-fold less potent. The 1-17 and a 1-9 monomer analog were 4- and 36-fold, respectively, less potent than the 1-9 dimer. Both the chemotactic and calcium response of the 1-9 dimer was inhibited by an antibody to CXCR4. The basis for the enhanced activity of the dimer form of SDF-1, 1-9 is uncertain, but it could involve an additional fortuitous binding site on the 1-9 peptide in addition to the normal SDF-1, 1-9 site. A 1-9 analog, 1-9[P2G] dimer, was found to be a CXCR4 antagonist. Overall this study shows that the N-terminal peptides are CXCR4 agonists or antagonists, and these could be leads for high affinity ligands.",,
10583729,"N-terminal splice variants of the type I PACAP receptor: isolation, characterization and ligand binding/selectivity determinants.","Three full-length cDNAs encoding functional splice variants of the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) type 1 receptor (PAC1) were isolated from Y-79 retinoblastoma cells and human cerebellum. Although the third intracellular loops of the three splice variants were identical, their N-terminal extracellular domains differed. The first full-length PAC1 variant, PAC1normal (PAC1n), encoded the entire N-terminus, whereas the second variant named PAC1short (PAC1s) was deleted by 21 amino acids (residues 89-109). Finally, the third variant, named PAC1very short (PAC1vs), was deleted by 57 amino acids (residues 53-109). Using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, it was established that all three variants were expressed in neuronal tissues. Binding- and cAMP studies using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably transfected with PAC1n, PAC1s and PAC1vs showed significant differences in the affinities and selectivities towards PACAP38, PACAP27 and VIP. PAC1n bound PACAP38 and PACAP27 with affinities in the low nanomolar range whereas VIP was bound with up to 400-fold lower affinity. PAC1vs preferentially bound PACAP38 (Ki=121 nM) and PACAP27 (Ki=129 nM) over VIP (Ki>1000 nM) but with 100-fold lower affinity than PAC1n. Surprisingly, PAC1s unselectively bound all three ligands with high affinity. These data indicate that residues 53-88 within the N-terminal domain of the PAC1 are important for high affinity ligand binding, whereas residues 89-109 determine the receptor's ligand selectivity.",,
9766811,Native thrombopoietin: structure and function.,"Thrombopoietin (TPO), the c-Mpl ligand, is produced constitutively in liver and other organs, circulates in the bloodstream, and is delivered to bone marrow, where it stimulates the early development of multiple hematopoietic lineages and megakaryocytopoiesis. The concentration of TPO in blood is regulated by c-Mpl mass on platelets and megakaryocytes. In addition to regulation by the number of TPO molecules, including the possible modulation of TPO mRNA abundance in bone marrow, megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production may be regulated as a result of modulation of TPO activity by proteolytic processing that generates truncated forms of the molecule. Characterization of TPO partially purified from human plasma, however, revealed that the full-length molecule was the predominant form in the blood of both normal individuals and thrombocytopenic patients, although small amounts of truncated species were detected. Thus, truncation of TPO, at least that in the circulation examined, does not appear to contribute to the direct regulation of platelet production in response to increased demand. Given that native TPO isolated from the plasma of thrombocytopenic animals comprises truncated forms, the truncation of TPO is likely of physiological importance in the life history of this molecule.",,
12547834,Natriuretic peptide receptor A activation stabilizes a membrane-distal dimer interface.,"We have shown previously (Rondeau, J.-J., McNicoll, N., Gagnon, J., Bouchard, N., Ong, H., and De Léan, A. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 2130-2136) that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) stabilizes a dimeric form of the natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA) by simultaneously interacting with both receptor subunits. However, the first crystallographic study of unliganded NPRA extracellular domain documented a V-shaped dimer involving a membrane-proximal dimer interface and separate binding sites for ANP on each monomer. We explored the possibility of an alternative A-shaped dimer involving a membrane-distal dimer interface by substituting an unpaired solvent-exposed cysteine for Trp(74) in the amino-terminal lobe of full-length NPRA. The predicted spacing between Trp(74) from both subunits drastically differs, depending on whether the V-shaped (84 A) or the A-shaped (8 A) dimer model is considered. In contrast with the expected results for the reported V-shaped dimer, the NPRA(W74C) mutant was constitutively covalently dimeric. Also, the subunits spontaneously reassociated following transient disulfide reduction by dithiothreitol and reoxidation. However, ANP could neither bind to nor activate NPRA(W74C). Permanent disulfide opening by reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide rescued ANP binding to NPRA(W74C). The NPRA mutant could be maintained as a covalent dimer while preserving its function by crosslinking with the bifunctional alkylating agent phenylenedimaleimides (PDM), the ortho-substituted oPDM being more efficient than mPDM or pPDM. These results indicate that the membrane-distal lobe of the NPRAM extracellular domains are dynamically interfacing in the unliganded state and that ANP binding stabilizes the receptor dimer with more stringent spacing at the dimer interface.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
1315572,Natural anticoagulant pathways in normal and transplanted human hearts.,"We have studied two natural anticoagulant pathways in normal and in transplanted human hearts. The first is the thrombomodulin pathway. Our immunocytochemical results show thrombomodulin localized to endothelium in heart biopsy specimens before transplantation. This reactivity persists in the absence of cellular rejection, but the infiltration of immune cells is associated with a lack of endothelial thrombomodulin. The second pathway is composed of antithrombin III (ATIII) bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) molecules on endothelial cells. These ATIII-HSPG complexes bind and inactivate thrombin at the endothelial surface. Our immunocytochemical results show ATIII localized to endothelium in heart biopsy specimens before transplantation. This reactivity is present in the absence of vascular rejection as defined by either angiography or microscopy. The absence of thrombomodulin and ATIII is always associated with fibrin deposition within the microcirculation. Thrombomodulin and ATIII pathways appear to be independent, for cellular rejection often is associated with thrombomodulin-negative ATIII-positive endothelium, and vascular rejection often is associated with thrombomodulin-positive ATIII-negative endothelium. Cytokines from activated macrophages down-regulate endothelial thrombomodulin without generally affecting the ATIII-HSPG pathway. Immunosuppressive therapy depletes cytokine-producing cells that affect thrombomodulin, but there presently is no therapy to protect endothelium in vascular rejection. It is possible that heparin could interact with endothelium and bind ATIII to maintain a state of thromboresistance.",The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation,1992
9103421,Natural killer cell cytolytic activity is inhibited by NKG2-A and activated by NKG2-C.,"NKG2 is a small family of type II transmembrane proteins possessing extracellular C-type lectin domains expressed primarily on NK cells. The function of these proteins is unknown. We have developed mAbs that recognize NKG2 family members on Western blots. Examination of cell extracts from NK cell clones demonstrates that individual NKG2 family members are expressed on subsets of NK cells. Because the anti-NKG2 mAb do not react with the cell surface Ag, signaling function was studied by generating cell lines that express a chimeric receptor consisting of a cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain from NKG2-A or NKG2-C fused to the extracellular segment of mouse NKR-P1C (NK1.1 Ag). Transfectants of the rat NK cell line, RNK-16, were tested for the effect of anti-NK1.1 mAb on cytolytic activity against the FcR+ target cell lines, P388D1 and P815. The anti-NK1.1 mAb stimulated lytic activity and calcium mobilization in the NK cell line expressing the NKG2-C/NKR-P1C chimeric receptor. By contrast, anti-NK1.1 inhibited the lytic activity and failed to stimulate a calcium response in cells expressing the NKG2-A/NKR-P1C chimeric receptor. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the inhibitory cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 selectively associates with the NKG2-A/NKR-P1C chimeric receptor, but not with the stimulatory NKG2-C/NKR-P1C receptor. These data indicate that NKG2-A and NKG2-C deliver, respectively, inhibitory and activating transmembrane signals in NK cells.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1997
26697006,"Natural Killer Cell Immunomodulation: Targeting Activating, Inhibitory, and Co-stimulatory Receptor Signaling for Cancer Immunotherapy.","There is compelling clinical and experimental evidence to suggest that natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in the recognition and eradication of tumors. Efforts at using NK cells as antitumor agents began over two decades ago, but recent advances in elucidating NK cell biology have accelerated the development of NK cell-targeting therapeutics. NK cell activation and the triggering of effector functions is governed by a complex set of activating and inhibitory receptors. In the early phases of cancer immune surveillance, NK cells directly identify and lyse cancer cells. Nascent transformed cells elicit NK cell activation and are eliminated. However, as tumors progress, cancerous cells develop immunosuppressive mechanisms that circumvent NK cell-mediated killing, allowing for tumor escape and proliferation. Therapeutic intervention aims to reverse tumor-induced NK cell suppression and sustain NK cells' tumorlytic capacities. Here, we review tumor-NK cell interactions, discuss the mechanisms by which NK cells generate an antitumor immune response, and discuss NK cell-based therapeutic strategies targeting activating, inhibitory, and co-stimulatory receptors.",,
11085751,Natural proteolytic processing of hemofiltrate CC chemokine 1 generates a potent CC chemokine receptor (CCR)1 and CCR5 agonist with anti-HIV properties.,"Hemofiltrate CC chemokine (HCC)-1 is a recently described human chemokine that is constitutively expressed in numerous tissues and is present at high concentrations in normal plasma. Using a cell line expressing CC chemokine receptor (CCR)5 as a bioassay, we isolated from human hemofiltrate an HCC-1 variant lacking the first eight amino acids. HCC-1[9-74] was a potent agonist of CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 and promoted calcium flux and chemotaxis of T lymphoblasts, monocytes, and eosinophils. It also blocked entry of HIV-1 strains using CCR5 as coreceptor. Limited tryptic digestion of HCC-1 generated the active variant. Conditioned media from several tumor cell lines activated HCC-1 with a high efficiency, and this activity could be inhibited by serine protease inhibitors. Our results indicate that HCC-1 represents a nonfunctional precursor that can be rapidly converted to the active chemokine by proteolytic processing. This process represents an additional mechanism by which tumor cells might generate chemoattractant molecules and recruit inflammatory cells. It might also affect HIV-1 replication in infected individuals and play an important role in AIDS pathogenesis.",,
15265897,"Natural, proteolytic release of a soluble form of human IL-15 receptor alpha-chain that behaves as a specific, high affinity IL-15 antagonist.","IL-15 and IL-2 are two structurally and functionally related cytokines whose high affinity receptors share the IL-2R beta-chain and gamma-chain in association with IL-15R alpha-chain (IL-15R alpha) or IL-2R alpha-chain, respectively. Whereas IL-2 action seems restricted to the adaptative T cells, IL-15 appears to be crucial for the function of the innate immune responses, and the pleiotropic expression of IL-15 and IL-15R alpha hints at a much broader role for the IL-15 system in multiple cell types and tissues. In this report, using a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay, we show the existence of a soluble form of human IL-15R alpha (sIL-15R alpha) that arises from proteolytic shedding of the membrane-anchored receptor. This soluble receptor is spontaneously released from IL-15R alpha-expressing human cell lines as well as from IL-15R alpha transfected COS-7 cells. This release is strongly induced by PMA and ionomycin, and to a lesser extent by IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. The size of sIL-15R alpha (42 kDa), together with the analysis of deletion mutants in the ectodomain of IL-15R alpha, indicates the existence of cleavage sites that are proximal to the plasma membrane. Whereas shedding induced by PMA was abrogated by the synthetic matrix metalloproteinases inhibitor GM6001, the spontaneous shedding was not, indicating the occurrence of at least two distinct proteolytic mechanisms. The sIL-15R alpha displayed high affinity for IL-15 and behaved as a potent and specific inhibitor of IL-15 binding to the membrane receptor, and of IL-15-induced cell proliferation (IC(50) in the range from 3 to 20 pM). These results suggest that IL-15R alpha shedding may play important immunoregulatory functions.",,
15082708,NB-3/Notch1 pathway via Deltex1 promotes neural progenitor cell differentiation into oligodendrocytes.,"Neurons and glia in the vertebrate central nervous system arise in temporally distinct, albeit overlapping, phases. Neurons are generated first followed by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from common progenitor cells. Increasing evidence indicates that axon-derived signals spatiotemporally modulate oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin formation. Our previous observations demonstrate that F3/contactin is a functional ligand of Notch during oligodendrocyte maturation, revealing the existence of another group of Notch ligands. Here, we establish that NB-3, a member of the F3/contactin family, acts as a novel Notch ligand to participate in oligodendrocyte generation. NB-3 triggers nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain and promotes oligodendrogliogenesis from progenitor cells and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells via Deltex1. In primary oligodendrocytes, NB-3 increases myelin-associated glycoprotein transcripts. Thus, the NB-3/Notch signaling pathway may prove to be a molecular handle to treat demyelinating diseases.",,
10669731,Nck-interacting Ste20 kinase couples Eph receptors to c-Jun N-terminal kinase and integrin activation.,"The mammalian Ste20 kinase Nck-interacting kinase (NIK) specifically activates the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase module. NIK also binds the SH3 domains of the SH2/SH3 adapter protein Nck. To determine whether Nck functions as an adapter to couple NIK to a receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, we determined whether NIK is activated by Eph receptors (EphR). EphRs constitute the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), and members of this family play important roles in patterning of the nervous and vascular systems. In this report, we show that NIK kinase activity is specifically increased in cells stimulated by two EphRs, EphB1 and EphB2. EphB1 kinase activity and phosphorylation of a juxtamembrane tyrosine (Y594), conserved in all Eph receptors, are both critical for NIK activation by EphB1. Although pY594 in the EphB1R has previously been shown to bind the SH2 domain of Nck, we found that stimulation of EphB1 and EphB2 led predominantly to a complex between NIK/Nck, p62(dok), RasGAP, and an unidentified 145-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p62(dok) most probably binds directly to the SH2 domain of Nck and RasGAP and indirectly to NIK bound to the SH3 domain of Nck. We found that NIK activation is also critical for coupling EphB1R to biological responses that include the activation of integrins and JNK by EphB1. Taken together, these findings support a model in which the recruitment of the Ste20 kinase NIK to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins by Nck is an important proximal step in the signaling cascade downstream of EphRs.",Molecular and cellular biology,2000
10744716,"Nectin-3, a new member of immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules that shows homophilic and heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activities.","We have isolated a novel cell-cell adhesion system localized at cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs). This system consists of at least nectin, a Ca(2+)-independent immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecule, and afadin, an actin filament-binding protein, that connects nectin to the actin cytoskeleton. Nectin constitutes a family consisting of two members, nectin-1 and -2. We have isolated here a third member of the nectin family and named it nectin-3. Nectin-3 has three splicing variants, nectin-3alpha (biggest), -3beta (middle), and -3gamma (smallest). Like nectin-1 and -2, nectin-3alpha consists of three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic region with the C-terminal consensus motif for binding to the PDZ domain. Nectin-3alpha formed a cis-homo-dimer and showed Ca(2+)-independent trans-homo-interaction to cause homophilic cell-cell adhesion. Nectin-3alpha furthermore showed trans-hetero-interaction with nectin-1 or -2 but did not form a cis-hetero-dimer with nectin-1 or -2. Nectin-1 did not show trans-hetero-interaction with nectin-2. The affinity of trans-hetero-interaction of nectin-3alpha with nectin-1 or -2 was higher than that of trans-homo-interaction of nectin-1, -2, or -3alpha. Nectin-2 and -3 were ubiquitously expressed, whereas nectin-1 was abundantly expressed in brain. Nectin-3alpha was colocalized with nectin-2 at cadherin-based AJs and interacted with afadin. These results indicate that the nectin family consists of at least three members, nectin-1, -2, and -3, all of which show homophilic and heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activities and are localized at cadherin-based AJs.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
15741237,"Nectin-like molecule-1/TSLL1/SynCAM3: a neural tissue-specific immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecule localizing at non-junctional contact sites of presynaptic nerve terminals, axons and glia cell processes.","Nectins are Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecules and comprise a family of four members. At the mossy fiber terminals of hippocampus, nectin-1 and nectin-3 localize at the presynaptic and postsynaptic sides of synaptic junctions, respectively, and their trans-interactions play a role in formation of synapses in cooperation with N-cadherin. Nectins are associated with the actin cytoskeleton through afadin, a nectin- and actin-filament-binding protein. Five nectin-like molecules (Necls) which have domain structures similar to those of nectins have been identified and here we characterize Necl-1/TSLL1/SynCAM3, from now on referred to as Necl-1. Tissue distribution analysis showed that Necl-1 was specifically expressed in the neural tissue. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that Necl-1 localized at the contact sites among axons, their terminals, and glia cell processes that cooperatively formed synapses, axon bundles and myelinated axons. Necl-1 showed Ca2+-independent homophilic cell-cell adhesion activity. It furthermore showed Ca2+-independent heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activity with Necl-2/IGSF4/RA175/SgIGSF/TSLC1/SynCAM1 from now on referred to as Necl-2, nectin-1 and nectin-3, but not with Necl-5 or nectin-2. The C-terminal cytoplasmic region of Necl-1 did not bind afadin but bound membrane-associated guanylate kinase subfamily members that contain the L27 domain, including Dlg3, Pals2 and CASK. These results indicate that Necl-1 is a neural-tissue-specific Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecule which potentially has membrane-associated guanylate kinase subfamily member-binding activity and localizes at the non-junctional cell-cell contact sites.",,

Afadin has one PDZ domain, three proline-rich regions, and one actin filament-binding domain. We found here that afadin directly interacted with a family of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which was isolated originally as the poliovirus receptor-related protein (PRR) family consisting of PRR1 and -2, and has been identified recently to be the alphaherpes virus receptor. PRR has a COOH-terminal consensus motif to which the PDZ domain of afadin binds. PRR and afadin were colocalized at cadherin-based cell-cell AJs in various tissues and cell lines. In E-cadherin-expressing EL cells, PRR was recruited to cadherin-based cell-cell AJs through interaction with afadin. PRR showed Ca2+-independent cell-cell adhesion activity.

11544254,"Nectin4/PRR4, a new afadin-associated member of the nectin family that trans-interacts with nectin1/PRR1 through V domain interaction.","Nectins are adhesion molecules that participate in the organization of epithelial and endothelial junctions and serve as receptors for herpes simplex virus entry. They belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily, are homologues of the poliovirus receptor (PVR/CD155), and were also named poliovirus receptor-related (PRR) proteins. We identify a new member of the nectin family named nectin4. Peptide sequences of human and murine nectin4 share 92% identity, and as for other members, the ectodomain is made of three immunoglobulin-like domains of V, C, C types. In contrast to other nectin molecules, detection of nectin4 transcripts is mainly restricted to placenta in human tissues. Expression is broader in mouse, and interestingly nectin4 is detected at days 11, 15, and 17 during murine embryogenesis. Nectin4 interacts with afadin, a F-actin-associated molecule, via its carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic sequence. Both molecules co-localize at cadherin-based adherens junctions in the MDCKII epithelial cell line. Nectins are homophilic adhesion molecules, and recently heterophilic interactions have been described between nectin3/nectin1 and nectin3/nectin2. We confirmed these trans-interactions and also described nectin3 as the PVR/CD155 ligand. By means of several approaches, we report on the identification of nectin4 as a new ligand for nectin1. First, a soluble chimeric recombinant nectin4 ectodomain (nectin4-Fc) trans-interacts with cells expressing nectin1 but not with cells expressing nectin2, nectin3, or PVR/CD155. Conversely, nectin1-Fc binds to cells expressing nectin4. Second, nectin1-Fc precipitates nectin4 expressed in COS cells. Third, reciprocal in vitro physical interactions were detected between nectin4-Fc and nectin1-Fc. The nectin4-Fc/nectin4-Fc interaction was detected suggesting that nectin4 exhibits both homophilic and heterophilic properties.

15258590,Neogenin mediates the action of repulsive guidance molecule.,"Repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) is a recently identified protein implicated in both axonal guidance and neural tube closure. The avoidance of chick RGM in the posterior optic tectum by growing temporal, but not nasal, retinal ganglion cell axons is thought to contribute to visual map formation. In contrast to ephrins, semaphorins, netrins and slits, no receptor mechanism for RGM action has been defined. Here, an expression cloning strategy identified neogenin as a binding site for RGM, with a sub-nanomolar affinity. Consistent with selective axonal responsiveness to RGM, neogenin is expressed in a gradient across the chick retina. Neogenin is known to be one of several netrin-binding proteins but only neogenin interacts with RGM. The avoidance of RGM by temporal retinal axons is blocked by the anti-neogenin antibody and the soluble neogenin ectodomain. Dorsal root ganglion axons are unresponsive to RGM but are converted to a responsive state by neogenin expression. Thus, neogenin functions as an RGM receptor.",,
12810718,Netrin binds discrete subdomains of DCC and UNC5 and mediates interactions between DCC and heparin.,"Netrins are secreted proteins that elicit both attractive and repulsive responses in migrating cells in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Netrins interact with members of two distinct families of transmembrane receptors, represented by DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) and UNC5. A human netrin fragment (soluble netrin; sNetrin) was purified from an engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line and used in a pull-down assay to map the interactions between netrin and its receptors. We find that sNetrin binds exclusively to the fifth fibronectin type III repeat of DCC and to each immunoglobulin repeat of UNC5. Both DCC and UNC5 bind to sNetrin with 1:1 stoichiometry in solution, and the minimal receptor fragments behave similarly to larger fragments in cross-linking experiments with purified sNetrin. We find no evidence for formation of a ternary complex between sNetrin and soluble forms of DCC and UNC5. We also find no evidence for an interaction between DCC and heparin and instead demonstrate that a loop on the fifth fibronectin type III repeat of DCC previously implicated in mediating interactions with heparin is important for sNetrin binding. Since netrin binds heparin, our results suggest that interactions between DCC and heparin are probably mediated by netrin.",,

Previous studies have failed to show a direct interaction of DCC with netrin-1 (ref. 10), suggesting the possibility of an additional receptor or co-receptor. Here we show that DCC interacts with the membrane-associated adenosine A2b receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor that induces cAMP accumulation on binding adenosine. We show that A2b is actually a netrin-1 receptor and induces cAMP accumulation on binding netrin-1. Finally, we show that netrin-1-dependent outgrowth of dorsal spinal cord axons directly involves A2b.

9950216,Netrin-1: interaction with deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and alterations in brain tumors and neuroblastomas.,"Netrins, a family of laminin-related secreted proteins, have critical roles in axon guidance and cell migration during development. The deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) protein has been implicated as a netrin-1 receptor component. The expression and function of netrins in adult tissues remain unknown, and direct interaction of netrin-1 with DCC has not been demonstrated. We cloned the human netrin-1 (NTN1L) gene, mapped it to chromosome 17p12-13, and found that it encodes a 604 amino acid protein with 98% identity to mouse netrin-1 and 50% identity with the Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-6 protein. NTN1L transcripts were detected in essentially all normal adult tissues studied, and markedly reduced or absent NTN1L expression was seen in approximately 50% of brain tumors and neuroblastomas. In one neuroblastoma, missense mutations at highly conserved NTN1L codons were found. Netrin-1 protein could be cross-linked to DCC protein on the cell surface, but it did not immunoprecipitate with DCC in the absence of cross-linking and it failed to bind to a soluble fusion protein containing the entire DCC extracellular domain. Our findings demonstrating NTN1L loss of expression and mutations suggest that NTN1L alterations may contribute to the development of some cancers. Furthermore, the binding of netrin-1 to DCC appears to depend on the presence of a coreceptor or accessory proteins.",Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,1999
12636918,Netrin-1/neogenin interaction stabilizes multipotent progenitor cap cells during mammary gland morphogenesis.,"Netrin-1 and its receptors play an essential role patterning the nervous system by guiding neurons and axons to their targets. To explore whether netrin-1 organizes nonneural tissues, we examined its role in mammary gland morphogenesis. Netrin-1 is expressed in prelumenal cells, and its receptor neogenin is expressed in a complementary pattern in adjacent cap cells of terminal end buds (TEBs). We discovered that loss of either gene results in disorganized TEBs characterized by exaggerated subcapsular spaces, breaks in basal lamina, dissociated cap cells, and an increased influx of cap cells into the prelumenal compartment. Cell aggregation assays demonstrate that neogenin mediates netrin-1-dependent cell clustering. Thus, netrin-1 appears to act locally through neogenin to stabilize the multipotent progenitor (cap) cell layer during mammary gland development. Our results suggest that netrin-1 and its receptor neogenin provide an adhesive, rather than a guidance, function during nonneural organogenesis.",Developmental cell,2003
10366627,"Netrin-3, a mouse homolog of human NTN2L, is highly expressed in sensory ganglia and shows differential binding to netrin receptors.","The netrins comprise a small phylogenetically conserved family of guidance cues important for guiding particular axonal growth cones to their targets. Two netrin genes, netrin-1 and netrin-2, have been described in chicken, but in mouse so far a single netrin gene, an ortholog of chick netrin-1, has been reported. We report the identification of a second mouse netrin gene, which we name netrin-3. Netrin-3 does not appear to be the ortholog of chick netrin-2 but is the ortholog of a recently identified human netrin gene termed NTN2L (""netrin-2-like""), as evidenced by a high degree of sequence conservation and by chromosomal localization. Netrin-3 is expressed in sensory ganglia, mesenchymal cells, and muscles during the time of peripheral nerve development but is largely excluded from the CNS at early stages of its development. The murine netrin-3 protein binds to netrin receptors of the DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) family [DCC and neogenin] and the UNC5 family (UNC5H1, UNC5H2 and UNC5H3). Unlike chick netrin-1, however, murine netrin-3 binds to DCC with lower affinity than to the other four receptors. Consistent with this finding, although murine netrin-3 can mimic the outgrowth-promoting activity of netrin-1 on commissural axons, it has lower specific activity than netrin-1. Thus, like netrin-1, netrin-3 may also function in axon guidance during development but may function predominantly in the development of the peripheral nervous system and may act primarily through netrin receptors other than DCC.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,1999
17973922,Netrin-G2 and netrin-G2 ligand are both required for normal auditory responsiveness.,"Mice in which netrin-G2 has been genetically inhibited do not startle to an acoustic stimulus, but otherwise perform normally through a behavioral test battery. Light microscopic examination of the inner ear showed no obvious structural abnormalities. Brainstem responses to acoustic stimuli (auditory brainstem responses, ABR) were also present, confirming the lack of any overarching defects in the inner ear or auditory nerve. Genetic inhibition of netrin-G2 ligand produced a nearly identical phenotype, that is, no startle with ABR present, and otherwise normal. This similarity confirms that these two proteins act in the same biological pathway. We have also determined that the affinity between the two proteins is strong, around 2.5 nM, similar to that observed between netrin-G1 and netrin-G1 ligand - 2.3 nM in our hands. The combination of equivalent phenotypes when genetically inhibited coupled with evidence of a strong biochemical interaction supports the notion of a receptor-ligand interaction between these two proteins in vivo. This interaction is critical for auditory synaptic responsiveness in the brain.",,

One exception is a cell surface complex containing promyogenic Ig superfamily members (CDO and BOC) and cadherins. Netrins and their receptors are established regulators of axon guidance, but little is known of their function outside the nervous system. We report here that myoblasts express the secreted factor netrin-3 and its receptor, neogenin. These proteins stimulate myotube formation and enhance myogenic bHLH- and NFAT-dependent transcription. Furthermore, neogenin binds to CDO in a cis fashion, and myoblasts lacking CDO are defective in responding to recombinant netrin. It is proposed that netrin-3 and neogenin may promote myogenic differentiation by an autocrine mechanism as components of a higher order complex of several promyogenic cell surface proteins.",,
8702572,Neu differentiation factor/neuregulin isoforms activate distinct receptor combinations.,"The multiple isoforms of Neu differentiation factor (NDF/neuregulin) induce a pleiotropic cellular response that is isoform-specific and cell type-dependent. The molecular basis of this heterogeneity was addressed by comparing the two major groups of isoforms, alpha and beta. Both groups bind to the catalytically impaired receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB-3, whose mitogenic stimulation by NDF requires transactivation by other ErbB proteins, either ErbB-1 or ErbB-2. By expressing each pair of receptors in interleukin 3-dependent myeloid cells, we found that both isoforms induced mitogenic signals in cells co-expressing the combination of ErbB-3 with ErbB-2. However, only the beta isoform stimulated cells that expressed both ErbB-3 and ErbB-1, and neither isoform was active on cells expressing ErbB-3 alone. Both isoforms bind to all ErbB-3-expressing cells, albeit with different affinities, but the co-stimulatory mitogenic effect is correlated with the ability of each auxiliary receptor to transphosphorylate ErbB-3. These results imply that NDF isoforms differ in their ability to induce receptor heterodimers; whereas both types of isoforms signal through ErbB-3/ErbB-2 heterodimers, only beta isoforms are able to stabilize ErbB-3/ErbB-1 heterodimers.",,
9168115,"Neuregulin-2, a new ligand of ErbB3/ErbB4-receptor tyrosine kinases.","The neuregulins (NRGs) are a family of multipotent epidermal-growth-factor-like (EGF-like) factors that arise from splice variants of a single gene. They influence the growth, differentiation, survival and fate of several cell types. We have now discovered a set of new neuregulin-like growth factors, which we call neuregulin-2 (NRG-2): these are encoded by their own gene and exhibit a distinct expression pattern in adult brain and developing heart. Like NRG-1, the EGF-like domain of the new ligands binds to both the ErbB3- and ErbB4-receptor tyrosine kinases. However, NRG-2 stimulates different ErbB-receptor tyrosine-phosphorylation profiles from NRG-1. Our results indicate that NRG-1 and NRG-2 mediate distinct biological processes by acting at different sites in tissues and eliciting different biochemical responses in cells.",Nature,1997
9275162,Neuregulin-3 (NRG3): a novel neural tissue-enriched protein that binds and activates ErbB4.,"We describe the identification of Neuregulin-3 (NRG3), a novel protein that is structurally related to the neuregulins (NRG1). The NRG1/neuregulins are a diverse family of proteins that arise by alternative splicing from a single gene. These proteins play an important role in controlling the growth and differentiation of glial, epithelial, and muscle cells. The biological effects of NRG1 are mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. However, genetic studies have suggested that the activity of ErbB4 may also be regulated in the central nervous system by a ligand distinct from NRG1. NRG3 is predicted to contain an extracellular domain with an epidermal growth factor (EGF) motif, a transmembrane domain, and a large cytoplasmic domain. We show that the EGF-like domain of NRG3 binds to the extracellular domain of ErbB4 in vitro. Moreover, NRG3 binds to ErbB4 expressed on cells and stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of this receptor. The expression of NRG3 is highly restricted to the developing and adult nervous system. These data suggest that NRG3 is a novel, neural-enriched ligand for ErbB4.",,
10348342,Neuregulin-4: a novel growth factor that acts through the ErbB-4 receptor tyrosine kinase.,"The ErbB/HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases consists of four receptors that bind a large number of growth factor ligands sharing an epidermal growth factor- (EGF)-like motif. Whereas ErbB-1 binds seven different ligands whose prototype is EGF, the three families of neuregulins (NRGs) activate ErbB-3 and/or ErbB-4. Here we characterize a fourth neuregulin, NRG-4, that acts through ErbB-4. The predicted pro-NRG-4 is a transmembrane protein carrying a unique EGF-like motif and a short cytoplasmic domain. A synthetic peptide encompassing the full-length EGF-like domain can induce growth of interleukin-dependent cells ectopically expressing ErbB-4, but not cells expressing the other three ErbB proteins or their combinations. Consistent with specificity to ErbB-4, NRG-4 can displace an ErbB-4-bound NRG-1 and can activate signaling downstream of this receptor. Expression of NRG-4 mRNA was detected in the adult pancreas and weakly in muscle; other tissues displayed no detectable NRG-4 mRNA. The primary structure and the pattern of expression of NRG-4, together with the strict specificity of this growth factor to ErbB-4, suggest a physiological role distinct from that of the known ErbB ligands.",Oncogene,1999
9856994,Neurexophilin binding to alpha-neurexins. A single LNS domain functions as an independently folding ligand-binding unit.,"alpha-Neurexins (Ialpha, IIalpha, and IIIalpha) are receptor-like proteins expressed in hundreds of isoforms on the neuronal cell surface. The extracellular domains of alpha-neurexins are composed of six LNS repeats, named after homologous sequences in the Laminin A G domain, Neurexins, and Sex hormone-binding globulin, with three interspersed epidermal growth factor-like domains. Purification of neurexin Ialpha revealed that it is tightly complexed to a secreted glycoprotein called neurexophilin 1. Neurexophilin 1 is a member of a family of at least four genes and resembles a neuropeptide, suggesting a function as an endogenous ligand for alpha-neurexins. We have now used recombinant proteins and knockout mice to investigate which isoforms and domains of different neurexins and neurexophilins interact with each other. We show that neurexophilins 1 and 3 but not 4 (neurexophilin 2 is not expressed in rodents) bind to a single individual LNS domain, the second overall LNS domain in all three alpha-neurexins. Although this domain is alternatively spliced, all splice variants bind, suggesting that alternative splicing does not regulate binding. Using homologous recombination to disrupt the neurexophilin 1 gene, we generated mutant mice that do not express detectable neurexophilin 1 mRNA. Mice lacking neurexophilin 1 are viable with no obvious morbidity or mortality. However, homozygous mutant mice exhibit male sterility, probably because homologous recombination resulted in the co-insertion into the neurexophilin gene of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase, which is known to cause male sterility. In the neurexophilin 1 knockout mice, neurexin Ialpha is complexed with neurexophilin 3 but not neurexophilin 4, suggesting that neurexophilin 1 is redundant with neurexophilin 3 and that neurexophilins 1 and 3 but not 4 bind to neurexins. This hypothesis was confirmed using expression experiments. Our data reveal that the six LNS and three epidermal growth factor domains of neurexins are independently folding ligand-binding domains that may interact with distinct targets. The results support the notion that neurexophilins represent a family of extracellular signaling molecules that interact with multiple receptors including all three alpha-neurexins.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
1369684,"Neurite growth-promoting protein (amphoterin, p30) binds syndecan.","A new ligand for syndecan (a cell surface heparan sulfate-rich proteoglycan) has been discovered. In the solid-phase binding assay utilizing small nitrocellulose discs to immobilize matrix molecules, binding of syndecan to neurite growth-promoting protein, p30/amphoterin, was observed. This binding was strongly dependent on the concentration of amphoterin used to coat the discs, but was saturable with an excess amount of syndecan. The interaction was inhibitable with heparan sulfate and heparin but less effectively with chondroitin sulfate, indicating that heparan sulfate chains of syndecan were involved in the binding. Anti-amphoterin antibodies inhibited the binding partially. Mouse mammary epithelial cells were shown to bind amphoterin directly but not after trypsin treatment or in the presence of heparin and to produce amphoterin in the extracellular space. Both syndecan and amphoterin were found to localize on lateral surfaces of newly adhered mammary epithelial cells. Toward confluency amphoterin amounts decreased. Because amphoterin can be localized to the same sites with syndecan and because of their interaction, amphoterin is a new putative pericellular ligand for syndecan. These interactions may be involved in the regulation of cell behavior.",,
14715956,Neurite outgrowth by the alternatively spliced region of human tenascin-C is mediated by neuronal alpha7beta1 integrin.,"The region of tenascin-C containing only alternately spliced fibronectin type-III repeat D (fnD) increases neurite outgrowth by itself and also as part of tenascin-C. We previously localized the active site within fnD to an eight amino acid sequence unique to tenascin-C, VFDNFVLK, and showed that the amino acids FD and FV are required for activity. The purpose of this study was to identify the neuronal receptor that interacts with VFDNFVLK and to investigate the hypothesis that FD and FV are important for receptor binding. Function-blocking antibodies against both alpha7 and beta1 integrin subunits were found to abolish VFDNFVLK-mediated process extension from cerebellar granule neurons. VFDNFVLK but not its mutant, VSPNGSLK, induced clustering of neuronal beta1 integrin immunoreactivity. This strongly implicates FD and FV as important structural elements for receptor activation. Moreover, biochemical experiments revealed an association of the alpha7beta1 integrin with tenascin-C peptides containing the VFDNFVLK sequence but not with peptides with alterations in FD and/or FV. These findings are the first to provide evidence that the alpha7beta1 integrin mediates a response to tenascin-C and the first to demonstrate a functional role for the alpha7beta1 integrin receptor in CNS neurons.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2004
9117260,Neurocan and phosphacan: two major nervous tissue-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans.,"Neurocan is a multidomain hyaluronan-binding chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that is synthesized by neurons, whereas the astroglial proteoglycan phosphacan is an mRNA splice variant representing the entire extracellular portion of a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase. A glycoform of phosphocan (phosphocan-KS) that contains both chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate is present in the postnatal rat central nervous system (CNS). The concentration of neurocan in brain increases during late embryonic development but then declines steeply during the early postnatal period together with hyaluronan, and neurocan also undergoes extensive proteolytic processing during the course of brain development. In contrast, the concentrations of both phosphocan and phosphocan-KS rise steadily after embryonic day 20 to reach a plateau at about 2 weeks postnatally. In the embryonic CNS the distribution of neurocan mRNA is more widespread than that of phosphocan, which is primarily present in regions of active cell proliferation. Neurocan mRNA is also present in areas where the proteoglycan is not expressed, and there is evidence that the short open reading frame in its 5'-leader may function as a cis-acting regulatory signal for the modulation of neurocan expression in the developing CNS. Neurocan and phosphocan bind saturably, reversibly, and with high affinity to neural cell adhesion molecules (Ng-CAM/L1, NCAM, TAG-1/axonin-1) and to tenascin-C. The proteoglycans and their ligands have overlapping localizations in the CNS, and binding of phosphocan to Ng-CAM/L1, NCAM, and tenascin-C is mediated by complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides on the proteoglycan. Neurocan and phosphocan also bind to neurons and are potent inhibitors of neuronal and glial adhesion and neurite outgrowth. Through their interactions with neural cell adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules, these proteoglycans may play a major role in modulating cell adhesion, neurite growth, and signal transduction across the plasma membrane during the development of the CNS.",,
12727971,Neurokinin B is a paracrine vasodilator in the human fetal placental circulation.,"Neurokinin (NK) B is a member of the tachykinin family of neurotransmitters, exerting hypotensive or hypertensive effects in the mammalian vasculature through synaptic release from peripheral neurons, according to either NK(1) and NK(2) or NK(3) receptor subtype expression, respectively. There is recent evidence that NKB is expressed by the syncytiotrophoblast of the human placenta, an organ that is not innervated. We hypothesized that NKB is a paracrine modulator of tone in the fetal placental circulation. We tested this hypothesis using the in vitro perfused human placental cotyledon. Our data show that NKB is a dilator of the fetal vasculature, causing a maximal 25.1 +/- 4.5% (mean +/- SEM; n = 5) decrease in fetal-side arterial hydrostatic pressure (5- microM NKB bolus; effective concentration in the circulation, 1.89 nM) after preconstriction with U-46619. RT-PCR demonstrated the presence of mRNA for NK(1) and NK(2) tachykinin receptors in the placenta. Using selective receptor antagonists, we found that NKB-induced vasodilation is through the NK(1) receptor subtype. We found no evidence for the involvement of either nitric oxide or prostacyclin in this response. This study demonstrates a paracrine role for NKB in the regulation of fetal placental vascular tone.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2003
7736595,Neuroligin 1: a splice site-specific ligand for beta-neurexins.,"Neurexins are neuronal cell surface proteins with hundreds of isoforms generated by alternative splicing. Here we describe neuroligin 1, a neuronal cell surface protein that is enriched in synaptic plasma membranes and acts as a splice site-specific ligand for beta-neurexins. Neuroligin 1 binds to beta-neurexins only if they lack an insert in the alternatively spliced sequence of the G domain, but not if they contain an insert. The extracellular sequence of neuroligin 1 is composed of a catalytically inactive esterase domain homologous to acetylcholinesterase. In situ hybridization reveals that alternative splicing of neurexins at the site recognized by neuroligin 1 is highly regulated. These findings support a model whereby alternative splicing of neurexins creates a family of cell surface receptors that confers interactive specificity onto their resident neurons.",Cell,1995
15169928,"Neuromedin U and its receptors: structure, function, and physiological roles.","Neuromedin U (NmU) is a structurally highly conserved neuropeptide. It is ubiquitously distributed, with highest levels found in the gastrointestinal tract and pituitary. Originally isolated from porcine spinal cord, it has since been isolated and sequenced from several species. Amino acid alignment of NmU from different species reveals a high level of conservation, and particular features within its structure are important for bioactivity. Specifically, the C terminus, including a terminal asparagine-linked amidation, is essential for activity. The conservation of NmU across a wide range of species indicates a strong evolutionary pressure to conserve this peptide and points to its physiological significance. Despite this, the precise physiological and indeed pathophysiological roles of NmU have remained elusive. NmU was first isolated based on its ability to contract rat uterine smooth-muscle (hence the suffix ""U"") and has since been implicated in the regulation of smooth-muscle contraction, blood pressure and local blood flow, ion transport in the gut, stress responses, cancer, gastric acid secretion, pronociception, and feeding behavior. Two G-protein-coupled receptors for NmU have recently been cloned. These receptors are widespread throughout the body but have differential distributions suggesting diverse but specific roles for the receptor subtypes. Here we detail the isolation and characterization of NmU, describe the discovery, cloning, distribution, and structure of its two receptors, and outline its possible roles in both physiology and pathophysiology. Ultimately the development of receptor-specific ligands and the generation of animals in which the receptors have been selectively knocked out will hopefully reveal the true extent of the biological roles of NmU and suggest novel therapeutic indications for selective activation or blockade of either of its receptors.",Pharmacological reviews,2004
10811630,Neuromedin U is a potent agonist at the orphan G protein-coupled receptor FM3.,"Neuromedins are a family of peptides best known for their contractile activity on smooth muscle preparations. The biological mechanism of action of neuromedin U remains unknown, despite the fact that the peptide was first isolated in 1985. Here we show that neuromedin U potently activates the orphan G protein-coupled receptor FM3, with subnanomolar potency, when FM3 is transiently expressed in human HEK-293 cells. Neuromedins B, C, K, and N are all inactive at this receptor. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of neuromedin U expression in a range of human tissues showed that the peptide is highly expressed in the intestine, pituitary, and bone marrow, with lower levels of expression seen in stomach, adipose tissue, lymphocytes, spleen, and the cortex. Similar analysis of FM3 expression showed that the receptor is widely expressed in human tissue with highest levels seen in adipose tissue, intestine, spleen, and lymphocytes, suggesting that neuromedin U may have a wide range of presently undetermined physiological effects. The discovery that neuromedin U is an endogenous agonist for FM3 will significantly aid the study of the full physiological role of this peptide.",,
10479680,Neuronal interleukin-16 (NIL-16): a dual function PDZ domain protein.,"Interleukin (IL)-16 is a proinflammatory cytokine that has attracted widespread attention because of its ability to block HIV replication. We describe the identification and characterization of a large neuronal IL-16 precursor, NIL-16. The N-terminal half of NIL-16 constitutes a novel PDZ domain protein sequence, whereas the C terminus is identical with splenocyte-derived mouse pro-IL-16. IL-16 has been characterized only in the immune system, and the identification of NIL-16 marks a previously unsuspected connection between the immune and the nervous systems. NIL-16 is a cytosolic protein that is detected only in neurons of the cerebellum and the hippocampus. The N-terminal portion of NIL-16 interacts selectively with a variety of neuronal ion channels, which is similar to the function of many other PDZ domain proteins that serve as intracellular scaffolding proteins. Among the NIL-16-interacting proteins is the class C alpha1 subunit of a mouse brain calcium channel (mbC alpha1). The C terminus of NIL-16 can be processed by caspase-3, resulting in the release of secreted IL-16. Furthermore, in cultured cerebellar granule neurons undergoing apoptosis, NIL-16 proteolysis parallels caspase-3 activation. Cerebellar granule neurons express the IL-16 receptor CD4. Exposure of these cells to IL-16 induces expression of the immediate-early gene, c-fos, via a signaling pathway that involves tyrosine phosphorylation. This suggests that IL-16 provides an autocrine function in the brain. Therefore, we hypothesize that NIL-16 is a dual function protein in the nervous system that serves as a secreted signaling molecule as well as a scaffolding protein.",,
15312648,Neuropeptide S: a neuropeptide promoting arousal and anxiolytic-like effects.,"Arousal and anxiety are behavioral responses that involve complex neurocircuitries and multiple neurochemical components. Here, we report that a neuropeptide, neuropeptide S (NPS), potently modulates wakefulness and could also regulate anxiety. NPS acts by activating its cognate receptor (NPSR) and inducing mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. The NPSR mRNA is widely distributed in the brain, including the amygdala and the midline thalamic nuclei. Central administration of NPS increases locomotor activity in mice and decreases paradoxical (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep in rats. NPS was further shown to produce anxiolytic-like effects in mice exposed to four different stressful paradigms. Interestingly, NPS is expressed in a previously undefined cluster of cells located between the locus coeruleus (LC) and Barrington's nucleus. These results indicate that NPS could be a new modulator of arousal and anxiety. They also show that the LC region encompasses distinct nuclei expressing different arousal-promoting neurotransmitters.",Neuron,2004

NPY mediates its effects through the activation of six G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes named Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), Y(4), Y(5), and y(6). Evidence suggests that NPY is involved in the pathophysiology of several disorders, such as the control of food intake, metabolic disorders, anxiety, seizures, memory, circadian rhythm, drug addiction, pain, cardiovascular diseases, rhinitis, and endothelial cell dysfunctions. The synthesis of agonists and antagonists for these receptors could be useful to treat several of these diseases.",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,2002
9001438,Neuropeptide Y receptor subtypes.,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an amidated 36-amino acid peptide with a wide distribution in the central and peripheral nervous system. It can evoke numerous physiological responses by activating specific receptors. Studies using NPY analogs in various model systems and cell types demonstrate different orders of ligand potency and receptor binding affinity. These studies suggest the existence of multiple subtypes of NPY receptors. NPY has been described to bind to at least three different receptors, Y1, Y2 and Y3. NPY has also been shown to interact with sigma receptor in vivo and in vitro. There are indications that more subtypes might exist. Ligand binding studies reveal that Y1, Y2 and Y3 receptors are all G-protein coupled. It is not yet confirmed whether the sigma receptor that interacts with NPY is G-protein coupled. Some studies show that NPY receptors may interact with other classical receptors, including alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors and cholinergic receptors. In the case of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, the receptor-receptor interaction is possibly via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. NPY receptors are coupled to various signal transduction mechanisms including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, and stimulation or inhibition of increases in intracellular Ca2+. Specific links between individual NPY receptor subtype and a particular signal transduction pathway are not established.",Life sciences,1995
12007534,Neuropeptide Y receptors as targets for anti-obesity drug development: perspective and current status.,"Neuropeptide Y is a widely distributed neuropeptide that elicits a plethora of physiological effects via interaction with six different receptors (Y(1)-y(6)). Recent attention has focused on the role of neuropeptide Y in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Neuropeptide Y stimulates food intake, inhibits energy expenditure, increases body weight and increases anabolic hormone levels by activating the neuropeptide Y Y(1) and Y(5) receptors in the hypothalamus. Based on these findings, several neuropeptide Y Y(1) and Y(5) receptor antagonists have been developed recently as potential anti-obesity agents. In addition, mice lacking neuropeptide Y, the neuropeptide Y Y(1) receptor or the neuropeptide Y Y(5) receptor have been generated. The data obtained to date with these newly developed tools suggests that neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists, particularly neuropeptide Y Y(1) receptor antagonists, may be useful anti-obesity agents. However, the redundancy of the neurochemical systems regulating energy homeostasis may limit the effect of ablating a single pathway. In addition, patients in whom the starvation response is activated, such as formerly obese patients who have lost weight or patients with complete or partial leptin deficiency, may be the best candidates for treatment with a neuropeptide Y receptor antagonist.",,
21314817,"Neuropeptide Y, B-type natriuretic peptide, substance P and peptide YY are novel substrates of fibroblast activation protein-α.","Fibroblast activation protein-α (FAP) is a cell surface-expressed and soluble enzyme of the prolyl oligopeptidase family, which includes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). FAP is not generally expressed in normal adult tissues, but is found at high levels in activated myofibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells in fibrosis and in stromal fibroblasts of epithelial tumours. FAP possesses a rare catalytic activity, hydrolysis of the post-proline bond two or more residues from the N-terminus of target substrates. α(2)-antiplasmin is an important physiological substrate of FAP endopeptidase activity. This study reports the first natural substrates of FAP dipeptidyl peptidase activity. Neuropeptide Y, B-type natriuretic peptide, substance P and peptide YY were the most efficiently hydrolysed substrates and the first hormone substrates of FAP to be identified. In addition, FAP slowly hydrolysed other hormone peptides, such as the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, which are efficient DPP4 substrates. FAP showed negligible or no hydrolysis of eight chemokines that are readily hydrolysed by DPP4. This novel identification of FAP substrates furthers our understanding of this unique protease by indicating potential roles in cardiac function and neurobiology.",The FEBS journal,2011
31572401,Neuropilin-1 Acts as a Receptor for Complement Split Products.,"Complement split products (CSPs), such as the fragments C4d and C3d, which are generated as a consequence of complement regulatory processes, are established markers for disease activity in autoimmunity or antibody-mediated graft rejection. Since immunoglobulin-like transcript 4 (ILT4) was previously shown to interact with soluble CSPs, but not with CSPs covalently-bound to target surfaces following classical complement activation, the present study aimed to identify novel cellular receptors interacting with covalently-deposited CSPs. By applying an unbiased screening approach using a cDNA mammalian expression library generated from human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and probed with recombinant human C4d, we identified neuropilin-1 (NRP1) as a novel receptor for C4d, C3d, and iC3b. NRP1, a highly conserved type 1 transmembrane protein, plays important roles in the development of the nervous and cardiovascular system as well as in tumorigenesis through interaction with its established binding partners, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin 3A (Sema3A). NRP1 is also expressed on immune cells and serves as a marker for murine Tregs. Although NRP1 contains domains homologous to ones found in some complement proteins, it has not been linked to the complement system. We demonstrate that binding of C4d to NRP1 expressing cells was dose-dependent and saturable, and had a K",Frontiers in immunology,2019

To determine the VEGF(165) and placenta growth factor 2 (PlGF-2)-binding sites of NRP1, recombinant NRP1 domains were expressed in mammalian cells as Myc-tagged, soluble proteins, and used in co-precipitation experiments with 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-PlGF-2. Anti-Myc antibodies immunoprecipitated 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-PlGF-2 in the presence of the b1b2 but not of the a1a2 and c domains. Neither b1 nor b2 alone was capable of binding 125I-VEGF165. In competition experiments, VEGF165 competed PlGF-2 binding to the NRP1 b1b2 domain, suggesting that the binding sites of VEGF165 and PlGF-2 overlap. The presence of the a1a2 domain greatly enhanced VEGF165, but not PlGF-2 binding to b1b2. Heparin enhanced the binding of both 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-PlGF-2 to the b1b2 domain by 20- and 4-fold, respectively. A heparin chain of at least 20-24 monosaccharides was necessary for binding. In addition, the b1b2 domain of NRP1 could bind heparin directly, requiring heparin oligomers of at least 8 monosaccharide units. It was concluded that an intact b1b2 domain serves as the VEGF165-, PlGF-2-, and heparin-binding sites in NRP1, and that heparin is a critical component for regulating VEGF165 and PlGF-2 interactions with NRP1 by physically interacting with both receptor and ligands.",,
9529250,Neuropilin-1 is expressed by endothelial and tumor cells as an isoform-specific receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major regulator of angiogenesis, binds to two receptor tyrosine kinases, KDR/Flk-1 and Flt-1. We now describe the purification and the expression cloning from tumor cells of a third VEGF receptor, one that binds VEGF165 but not VEGF121. This isoform-specific VEGF receptor (VEGF165R) is identical to human neuropilin-1, a receptor for the collapsin/semaphorin family that mediates neuronal cell guidance. When coexpressed in cells with KDR, neuropilin-1 enhances the binding of VEGF165 to KDR and VEGF165-mediated chemotaxis. Conversely, inhibition of VEGF165 binding to neuropilin-1 inhibits its binding to KDR and its mitogenic activity for endothelial cells. We propose that neuropilin-1 is a novel VEGF receptor that modulates VEGF binding to KDR and subsequent bioactivity and therefore may regulate VEGF-induced angiogenesis.",,
10748121,Neuropilin-2 is a receptor for the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) forms VEGF-145 and VEGF-165 [corrected].,"Neuropilin-1 (np-1) and neuropilin-2 (np-2) are receptors for axon guidance factors belonging to the class 3 semaphorins. np-1 also binds to the 165-amino acid heparin-binding form of VEGF (VEGF(165)) but not to the shorter VEGF(121) form, which lacks a heparin binding ability. We report that human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells express the a17 and a22 splice forms of the np-2 receptor. Both np-2 forms bind VEGF(165) with high affinity in the presence of heparin (K(D) 1.3 x 10(-10) m) but not VEGF(121). np-2 also binds the heparin-binding form of placenta growth factor. These binding characteristics resemble those of np-1. VEGF(145) is a secreted heparin binding VEGF form that contains the peptide encoded by exon 6 of VEGF but not the peptide encoded by exon 7, which is present in VEGF(165). VEGF(145) binds to np-2 with high affinity (K(D) 7 x 10(-10) m). Surprisingly, VEGF(145) did not bind to np-1. Indeed, VEGF(145) does not bind to MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which predominantly express np-1. By contrast, VEGF(145) binds to human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells, which express both np-1 and np-2. The binding of VEGF(165) to porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing recombinant np-2 did not affect the proliferation or migration of the cells. Nevertheless, it is possible that VEGF-induced np-2-mediated signaling will take place only in the presence of other VEGF receptors such as VEGF receptor-1 or VEGF receptor-2.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000

Unlike neuropilin-1, which binds with high affinity to the three structurally related semaphorins Sema III, Sema E, and Sema IV, neuropilin-2 shows high affinity binding only to Sema E and Sema IV, not Sema III.

Immunoanalysis of membranes prepared from cells expressing a c-myc-tagged version of hNT1-R revealed multiple c-myc cross-reacting polypeptides of high molecular mass, suggesting that hNT1-R was glycosylated in yeast. High-affinity binding sites for 125I-labeled-[monoiodo-Tyr3]neurotensin ([125I-Tyr3]NT) were detected on hNT1-R-expressing cells with Kd and Bmax values of 3.2 nM and of 500 receptors per cell, respectively. Competition binding studies of neurotensin with SR142948 and SR48692, two nonpeptidic antagonists of hNT1-R, indicated that the yeast-produced recombinant receptor displayed the same pharmacological properties as hNT1-R expressed in mammalian cells. Interestingly, neurotensin activated the pheromone pathway in hNT1-R-expressing cells in a dose-dependent fashion, as revealed by a beta-galactosidase activity assay with a pheromone-responsive Fus1:lacZ construct. Mutational inactivation of the SST2 and STE2 genes increased the level of beta-galactosidase activity in response to neurotensin by twofold. Recombinant hNT1-R-producing cells, which lacked the endogenous G-protein-coupled receptor for the alpha pheromone, mated with wild-type MATalpha haploid cells in response to neurotensin, leading to bona fide diploid zygote formation. This is the first report of a mammalian receptor that can replace the endogenous pheromone receptor when produced in yeast, by signaling a fully effective, agonist-induced, mating process.",European journal of biochemistry,2001
9851594,Neurotensin is an antagonist of the human neurotensin NT2 receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.,"The human levocabastine-sensitive neurotensin NT2 receptor was cloned from a cortex cDNA library and stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in order to study its binding and signalling characteristics. The receptor binds neurotensin as well as several other ligands already described for neurotensin NT1 receptor. It also binds levocabastine, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist that is not recognised by neurotensin NT1 receptor. Neurotensin binding to recombinant neurotensin NT2 receptor expressed in CHO cells does not elicit a biological response as determined by second messenger measurements. Levocabastine, and the peptides neuromedin N and xenin were also ineffective on neurotensin NT2 receptor activation. Experiments with the neurotensin NT1 receptor antagonists SR48692 and SR142948A, resulted in the unanticipated discovery that both molecules are potent agonists on neurotensin NT2 receptor. Both compounds, following binding to neurotensin NT2 receptor, enhance inositol phosphates (IP) formation with a subsequent [Ca2+]i mobilisation; induce arachidonic acid release; and stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. Interestingly, these activities are antagonised by neurotensin and levocabastine in a concentration-dependent manner. These activities suggest that the human neurotensin NT2 receptor may be of physiological importance and that a natural agonist for the receptor may exist.",,

15800062,Neutrophil migration across tight junctions is mediated by adhesive interactions between epithelial coxsackie and adenovirus receptor and a junctional adhesion molecule-like protein on neutrophils.,"Neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMN]) transepithelial migration during inflammatory episodes involves a complex series of adhesive interactions and signaling events. Previous studies have shown that key adhesive interactions between leukocyte CD11b/CD18 and basally expressed fucosylated glycoproteins followed by binding to desmosomal-associated JAM-C are key elements of the transmigration response. Here we provide the first evidence that PMN-expressed junctional adhesion molecule-like protein (JAML) regulates transmigration via binding interactions with epithelial coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR). Experiments with a JAML fusion protein revealed specific binding of JAML to epithelial CAR expressed at tight junctions in T84 cell monolayers and normal human colonic mucosa. Furthermore, JAML-CAR binding is mediated via the membrane distal immunoglobulin (Ig) loop of CAR and the membrane proximal Ig loop of JAML. PMN bound to immobilized CAR but not JAML in a divalent cation-independent manner. Lastly, in assays of PMN transepithelial migration, JAML/CAR fusion proteins and their antibodies significantly inhibited transmigration in a specific manner. Taken together, these results indicate that JAML and CAR are a novel pair of adhesion molecules that play an important role in modulating PMN migration cross epithelial tight junctions. These findings add a new element to a multistep model of PMN transepithelial migration and may provide new targets for anti-inflammatory therapies.",,
19283782,New assay to detect low-affinity interactions and characterization of leukocyte receptors for collagen including leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1).,"Leukocyte activity is controlled by numerous interactions between membrane receptors and ligands on the cell surface. These interactions are of low affinity making detection difficult. We developed a sensitive assay that could readily detect extremely weak interactions such as that between CD200 and the activating receptor CD200RLa (K(d)>500 microM) at the protein level. We used the new technology to screen for interactions of inhibitory receptors for collagens. We confirmed that both human and mouse leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1, and in addition the related inhibitory leukocyte Ig-like receptor subfamily B member 4 (CD85K, Gp49B), bound collagen specifically, whereas other cell surface proteins gave no binding. The monomeric affinities of the interactions were then determined to allow comparison with other leukocyte interactions and indicate conditions when these interactions might lead to inhibitory signals.",,
30547091,New neurons use Slit-Robo signaling to migrate through the glial meshwork and approach a lesion for functional regeneration.,"After brain injury, neural stem cell-derived neuronal precursors (neuroblasts) in the ventricular-subventricular zone migrate toward the lesion. However, the ability of the mammalian brain to regenerate neuronal circuits for functional recovery is quite limited. Here, using a mouse model for ischemic stroke, we show that neuroblast migration is restricted by reactive astrocytes in and around the lesion. To migrate, the neuroblasts use Slit1-Robo2 signaling to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton in reactive astrocytes at the site of contact. Slit1-overexpressing neuroblasts transplanted into the poststroke brain migrated closer to the lesion than did control neuroblasts. These neuroblasts matured into striatal neurons and efficiently regenerated neuronal circuits, resulting in functional recovery in the poststroke mice. These results suggest that the positioning of new neurons will be critical for functional neuronal regeneration in stem/progenitor cell-based therapies for brain injury.",,
10993067,Nicastrin modulates presenilin-mediated notch/glp-1 signal transduction and betaAPP processing.,"Nicastrin, a transmembrane glycoprotein, forms high molecular weight complexes with presenilin 1 and presenilin 2. Suppression of nicastrin expression in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos induces a subset of notch/glp-1 phenotypes similar to those induced by simultaneous null mutations in both presenilin homologues of C. elegans (sel-12 and hop-1). Nicastrin also binds carboxy-terminal derivatives of beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP), and modulates the production of the amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) from these derivatives. Missense mutations in a conserved hydrophilic domain of nicastrin increase A beta42 and A beta40 peptide secretion. Deletions in this domain inhibit A beta production. Nicastrin and presenilins are therefore likely to be functional components of a multimeric complex necessary for the intramembranous proteolysis of proteins such as Notch/GLP-1 and betaAPP.",,

7931060,NK3-specific natural killer cells are selectively inhibited by Bw4-positive HLA alleles with isoleucine 80.,"Natural killer (NK) cell clones have been previously described which are inhibited by HLA-C alleles with Asn77-Lys80 (NK1-specific cells) or by HLA-C alleles with Ser77-Asn80 (NK2-specific cells). In the present work, the generation of NK cells with HLA-B-related specificities was attempted by stimulation of a Bw4 homozygous responder by a Bw6 homozygous donor. Two NK clones were found, which were inhibited by HLA-Bw4 (but not by HLA-Bw6) allotypes and by some HLA-A allotypes that share the Bw4 public epitope. Inhibition of NK cell-mediated lysis strongly correlated with the presence of an Ile residue at position 80 of the protective allele. These NK cell clones define a new specificity termed NK3.",The Journal of experimental medicine,1994
8046332,NKB1: a natural killer cell receptor involved in the recognition of polymorphic HLA-B molecules.,"Natural killer (NK) cells kill normal and transformed hematopoietic cells that lack expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens. Lysis of HLA-negative Epstein Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) by human NK cell clones can be inhibited by transfection of the target cells with certain HLA-A, -B, or -C alleles. NK cell clones established from an individual demonstrate clonal heterogeneity in HLA recognition and a single NK clone can recognize multiple alleles. We describe a potential human NK cell receptor (NKB1) for certain HLA-B alleles (e.g., HLA-B*5101 and-B*5801) identified by the mAb DX9. NKB1 is a 70-kD glycoprotein that is expressed on a subset of NK cells and NK cell clones. DX9 monoclonal antibody (mAb) specifically inhibits the interaction between NK cell clones and B-LCL targets transfected with certain HLA-B alleles, but does not affect recognition of HLA-A or HLA-C antigens. An individual NK cell clone can independently recognize B-LCL targets transfected with HLA-B or HLA-C antigens; however, DX9 mAb only affects interaction with transfectants expressing certain HLA-B alleles. These findings demonstrate the existence of NK cell receptors involved in the recognition of HLA-B and imply the presence of multiple receptors for MHC on an individual NK clone.",The Journal of experimental medicine,1994
26041808,NKG2D Receptor and Its Ligands in Host Defense.,"NKG2D is an activating receptor expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells, CD8(+) T cells, and subsets of CD4(+) T cells, invariant NKT cells (iNKT), and γδ T cells. In humans, NKG2D transmits signals by its association with the DAP10 adapter subunit, and in mice alternatively spliced isoforms transmit signals either using DAP10 or DAP12 adapter subunits. Although NKG2D is encoded by a highly conserved gene (KLRK1) with limited polymorphism, the receptor recognizes an extensive repertoire of ligands, encoded by at least eight genes in humans (MICA, MICB, RAET1E, RAET1G, RAET1H, RAET1I, RAET1L, and RAET1N), some with extensive allelic polymorphism. Expression of the NKG2D ligands is tightly regulated at the level of transcription, translation, and posttranslation. In general, healthy adult tissues do not express NKG2D glycoproteins on the cell surface, but these ligands can be induced by hyperproliferation and transformation, as well as when cells are infected by pathogens. Thus, the NKG2D pathway serves as a mechanism for the immune system to detect and eliminate cells that have undergone ""stress."" Viruses and tumor cells have devised numerous strategies to evade detection by the NKG2D surveillance system, and diversification of the NKG2D ligand genes likely has been driven by selective pressures imposed by pathogens. NKG2D provides an attractive target for therapeutics in the treatment of infectious diseases, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.",,
10652313,NMR solution structure of complement-like repeat CR3 from the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Evidence for specific binding to the receptor binding domain of human alpha(2)-macroglobulin.,"We have used NMR methods to determine the structure of the calcium complex of complement-like repeat 3 (CR3) from the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and to examine its specific interaction with the receptor binding domain of human alpha(2)-macroglobulin. CR3 is one of eight related repeats that constitute a major ligand binding region of LRP. The structure is very similar in overall fold to homologous complement-like repeat CR8 from LRP and complement-like repeats LB1, LB2, and LB5 from the low density lipoprotein receptor and contains a short two-strand antiparallel beta-sheet, a one turn alpha-helix, and a high affinity calcium site with coordination from four carboxyls and two backbone carbonyls. The surface electrostatics and topography are, however, quite distinct from each of these other repeats. Two-dimensional (1)H,(15)N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra provide evidence for a specific, though relatively weak (K(d) approximately 140 microM), interaction between CR3 and human alpha2-macroglobulin receptor binding domain that involves a contiguous patch of surface residues in the central region of CR3. This specific interaction is consistent with a mode of LRP binding to ligands that uses contributions from more than one domain to generate a wide array of different binding sites, each with overall high affinity.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
12036962,NMR structure and dynamics of a receptor-active apolipoprotein E peptide.,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is important in lipid metabolism due to its interaction with members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. ApoE is able to interact with the LDL receptor only when it is bound to lipid particles. To address structural aspects of this phenomenon, a receptor-active apoE peptide, encompassing the receptor-binding region of the protein, was studied by NMR in the presence of the lipid-mimicking agent trifluoroethanol. In 50% trifluoroethanol, apoE-(126-183) forms a continuous amphipathic alpha-helix over residues Thr(130)-Glu(179). Detailed NMR relaxation analysis indicates a high degree of plasticity for the residues surrounding 149-159. This intrinsic flexibility imposes a curvature to the peptide that may be important in terms of interaction of apoE with various sized lipid particles and the LDL receptor. Residues 165-179 of apoE may act as a molecular switch whereby these residues are unstructured in the absence of lipids and prevent interaction with the LDL receptor. In the presence of lipids, these residues become helical resulting in a receptor-active conformation of the protein. Furthermore, the electrostatic characteristics and geometric features of apoE-(126-183) suggest that apoE binds to the LDL receptor by interacting with more than one of the receptor ligand-binding repeats.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
15273303,NMR structure of CXCR3 binding chemokine CXCL11 (ITAC).,"CXCL11 (ITAC) is one of three chemokines known to bind the receptor CXCR3, the two others being CXCL9 (Mig) and CXCL10 (IP-10). CXCL11 differs from the other CXCR3 ligands in both the strength and the particularities of its receptor interactions: It has a higher affinity, is a stronger agonist, and behaves differently when critical N-terminal residues are deleted. The structure of CXCL11 was determined using solution NMR to allow comparison with that of CXCL10 and help elucidate the source of the differences. CXCL11 takes on the canonical chemokine fold but exhibits greater conformational flexibility than has been observed for related chemokines under the same sample conditions. Unlike related chemokines such as IP-10 and IL-8, ITAC does not appear to form dimers at millimolar concentrations. The origin for this behavior can be found in the solution structure, which indicates a beta-bulge in beta-strand 1 that distorts the dimerization interface used by other CXC chemokines.",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,2004
22133682,"Nogo receptor 3, a paralog of Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1), may function as a NgR1 co-receptor for Nogo-66.","Nogo-A is a major myelin associated inhibitor that blocks regeneration of injured axons in the central nervous system (CNS). Nogo-66 (a 66-residue domain of Nogo-A) expressed on the surface of oligodendrocytes has been shown to directly interact with Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1). A number of additional components of NgR1 receptor complex essential for its signaling have been uncovered. However, detailed composition of the complex and its signaling mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we show that Nogo receptor 3 (NgR3), a paralog of NgR1, is a binding protein for NgR1. The interaction is highly specific because other members of the reticulin family, to which Nogo-A belongs, do not bind to NgR3. Neither does NgR3 show any binding activity with Nogo receptor 2 (NgR2), another NgR1 paralog. Majority of NgR3 domains are required for its binding to NgR1. Moreover, a truncated NgR3 with the membrane anchoring domain deleted can function as a decoy receptor to reverse neurite outgrowth inhibition caused by Nogo-66 in culture. These in vitro results, together with previously reported overlapping expression profile between NgR1 and NgR3, suggest that NgR3 may be associated with NgR1 in vivo and that their binding interface may be targeted for treating neuronal injuries.",Journal of genetics and genomics = Yi chuan xue bao,2011
14592966,Nogo-A at CNS paranodes is a ligand of Caspr: possible regulation of K(+) channel localization.,"We report Nogo-A as an oligodendroglial component congregating and interacting with the Caspr-F3 complex at paranodes. However, its receptor Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) does not segregate to specific axonal domains. CHO cells cotransfected with Caspr and F3, but not with F3 alone, bound specifically to substrates coated with Nogo-66 peptide and GST-Nogo-66. Binding persisted even after phosphatidylinositol- specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) removal of GPI-linked F3 from the cell surface, suggesting a direct interaction between Nogo-66 and Caspr. Both Nogo-A and Caspr co-immunoprecipitated with Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, and the developmental expression pattern of both paralleled compared with Kv1.1, implicating a transient interaction between Nogo-A-Caspr and K(+) channels at early stages of myelination. In pathological models that display paranodal junctional defects (EAE rats, and Shiverer and CGT(-/-) mice), distances between the paired labeling of K(+) channels were shortened significantly and their localization shifted toward paranodes, while paranodal Nogo-A congregation was markedly reduced. Our results demonstrate that Nogo-A interacts in trans with axonal Caspr at CNS paranodes, an interaction that may have a role in modulating axon-glial junction architecture and possibly K(+)-channel localization during development.",The EMBO journal,2003
28953886,Non-homeostatic body weight regulation through a brainstem-restricted receptor for GDF15.,"Under homeostatic conditions, animals use well-defined hypothalamic neural circuits to help maintain stable body weight, by integrating metabolic and hormonal signals from the periphery to balance food consumption and energy expenditure. In stressed or disease conditions, however, animals use alternative neuronal pathways to adapt to the metabolic challenges of altered energy demand. Recent studies have identified brain areas outside the hypothalamus that are activated under these 'non-homeostatic' conditions, but the molecular nature of the peripheral signals and brain-localized receptors that activate these circuits remains elusive. Here we identify glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) as a brainstem-restricted receptor for growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). GDF15 regulates food intake, energy expenditure and body weight in response to metabolic and toxin-induced stresses; we show that Gfral knockout mice are hyperphagic under stressed conditions and are resistant to chemotherapy-induced anorexia and body weight loss. GDF15 activates GFRAL-expressing neurons localized exclusively in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the mouse brainstem. It then triggers the activation of neurons localized within the parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala, which constitute part of the 'emergency circuit' that shapes feeding responses to stressful conditions. GDF15 levels increase in response to tissue stress and injury, and elevated levels are associated with body weight loss in numerous chronic human diseases. By isolating GFRAL as the receptor for GDF15-induced anorexia and weight loss, we identify a mechanistic basis for the non-homeostatic regulation of neural circuitry by a peripheral signal associated with tissue damage and stress. These findings provide opportunities to develop therapeutic agents for the treatment of disorders with altered energy demand.",Nature,2017
27036869,Noncanonical WNT-5B signaling induces inflammatory responses in human lung fibroblasts.,"COPD is a progressive chronic lung disease characterized by pulmonary inflammation. Several recent studies indicate aberrant expression of WNT ligands and Frizzled receptors in the disease. For example, WNT-5A/B ligand expression was recently found to be increased in lung fibroblasts of COPD patients. However, possible effects of WNT-5A and WNT-5B on inflammation have not been investigated yet. In this study, we assessed the regulation of inflammatory cytokine release in response to WNT-5A/B signaling in human lung fibroblasts. Primary human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), and primary lung fibroblasts from COPD patients and non-COPD controls were treated with recombinant WNT-5A or WNT-5B to assess IL-6 and CXCL8 cytokine secretion and gene expression levels. Following WNT-5B, and to a lesser extent WNT-5A stimulation, fibroblasts showed increased IL-6 and CXCL8 cytokine secretion and mRNA expression. WNT-5B-mediated IL-6 and CXCL8 release was higher in fibroblasts from COPD patients than in non-COPD controls. In MRC-5 fibroblasts, WNT-5B-induced CXCL8 release was mediated primarily via the Frizzled-2 receptor and TAK1 signaling, whereas canonical β-catenin signaling was not involved. In further support of noncanonical signaling, we showed activation of JNK, p38, and p65 NF-κB by WNT-5B. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK and p38 prevented WNT-5B-induced IL-6 and CXCL8 secretion, whereas IKK inhibition prevented CXCL8 secretion only, indicating distinct pathways for WNT-5B-induced IL-6 and CXCL8 release. WNT-5B induces IL-6 and CXCL8 secretion in pulmonary fibroblasts. In summary, WNT-5B mediates this via Frizzled-2 and TAK1. As WNT-5 signaling is increased in COPD, this WNT-5-induced inflammatory response could represent a therapeutic target.",,
15282370,Noncompetitive allosteric inhibitors of the inflammatory chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2: prevention of reperfusion injury.,"The chemokine CXC ligand 8 (CXCL8)/IL-8 and related agonists recruit and activate polymorphonuclear cells by binding the CXC chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) and CXCR2. Here we characterize the unique mode of action of a small-molecule inhibitor (Repertaxin) of CXCR1 and CXCR2. Structural and biochemical data are consistent with a noncompetitive allosteric mode of interaction between CXCR1 and Repertaxin, which, by locking CXCR1 in an inactive conformation, prevents signaling. Repertaxin is an effective inhibitor of polymorphonuclear cell recruitment in vivo and protects organs against reperfusion injury. Targeting the Repertaxin interaction site of CXCR1 represents a general strategy to modulate the activity of chemoattractant receptors.",,
10713099,Noncovalent association of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and minimal determinants for binding to P-selectin.,"P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a disulfide-bonded, homodimeric mucin ( approximately 250 kDa) on leukocytes that binds to P-selectin on platelets and endothelial cells during the initial steps in inflammation. Because it has been proposed that only covalently dimerized PSGL-1 can bind P-selectin, we investigated the factors controlling dimerization of PSGL-1 and re-examined whether covalent dimers are required for binding its P-selectin. Recombinant forms of PSGL-1 were created in which the single extracellular Cys (Cys(320)) was replaced with either Ser (C320S-PSGL-1) or Ala (C320A-PSGL-1). Both recombinants migrated as monomeric species of approximately 120 kDa under both nonreducing and reducing conditions on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. P-selectin bound similarly to cells expressing either wild type or mutated forms of PSGL-1 in both flow cytometric and rolling adhesion assays. Unexpectedly, chemical cross-linking studies revealed that both C320S- and C320A-PSGL-1 noncovalently associate in the plasma membrane and cross-linking generates dimeric species. Chimeric recombinants of PSGL-1 in which the transmembrane domain in PSGL-1 was replaced with the transmembrane domain of CD43 (CD43TMD-PSGL-1) could not be chemically cross-linked, suggesting that residues within the transmembrane domain of PSGL-1 are required for noncovalent association. Cells expressing CD43TMD-PSGL-1 bound P-selectin. To further address the ability of P-selectin to bind monomeric derivatives of PSGL-1, intact HL-60 cells were trypsin-treated, which generated a soluble approximately 25-kDa NH(2)-terminal fragment of PSGL-1 that bound to immobilized P-selectin. Because N-glycosylation of PSGL-1 hinders trypsin cleavage, a recombinant form of PSGL-1 was generated in which all three potential N-glycosylation sites were mutated (DeltaN-PSGL-1). Cells expressing DeltaN-PSGL-1 bound P-selectin, and trypsin treatment of the cells generated NH(2)-terminal monomeric fragments (<10 kDa) of PSGL-1 that bound to P-selectin. These results demonstrate that Cys(320)-dependent dimerization of PSGL-1 is not required for binding to P-selectin and that a small monomeric fragment of PSGL-1 is sufficient for P-selectin recognition.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
15905359,Nonpeptide and peptide growth hormone secretagogues act both as ghrelin receptor agonist and as positive or negative allosteric modulators of ghrelin signaling.,"Two nonpeptide (L692,429 and MK-677) and two peptide [GH-releasing peptide (GHRP)-6 and ghrelin] agonists were compared in binding and in signal transduction assays: calcium mobilization, inositol phosphate turnover, cAMP-responsive element (CRE), and serum-responsive element (SRE) controlled transcription, as well as arrestin mobilization. MK-677 acted as a simple agonist having an affinity of 6.5 nm and activated all signal transduction systems with similar high potency (0.2-1.4 nm). L-692,429 also displayed a very similar potency in all signaling assays (25-60 nm) but competed with a 1000-fold lower apparent affinity for ghrelin binding and surprisingly acted as a positive allosteric receptor modulator by increasing ghrelin's potency 4- to 10-fold. In contrast, the potency of GHRP-6 varied 600-fold (0.1-61 nm) depending on the signal transduction assay, and it acted as a negative allosteric modulator of ghrelin signaling. Unexpectedly, the maximal signaling efficacy for ghrelin was increased above what was observed with the hormone itself during coadministration with the nonendogenous agonists. It is concluded that agonists for the ghrelin receptor vary both in respect of their intrinsic agonist properties and in their ability to modulate ghrelin signaling. A receptor model is presented wherein ghrelin normally only activates one receptor subunit in a dimer and where the smaller nonendogenous agonists bind in the other subunit to act both as coagonists and as either neutral (MK-677), positive (L-692,429), or negative (GHRP-6) modulators of ghrelin function. It is suggested that an optimal drug candidate could be an agonist that also is a positive modulator of ghrelin signaling.",,

Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characterization of SB 223412, a novel, potent and selective neurokinin-3 receptor antagonist.","The in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile of SB 223412 [(S)-(-)-N-(alpha-ethylbenzyl)-3-hydroxy-2-phenylquinoline-4-carbo xamide], a novel human NK-3 (hNK-3) receptor antagonist, is described. SB 223412 demonstrated enantioselective affinity for inhibition of [125I][MePhe7]neurokinin B (NKB) binding to membranes of CHO cells expressing the hNK-3 receptor (CHO hNK-3). SB 223412, the (S)-isomer, (Ki = 1.0 nM), has similar affinity as the natural ligand, NKB (Ki = 0.8 nM) and another nonpeptide NK-3 receptor antagonist, SR 142801 (Ki = 1.2 nM). SB 223412 was selective for hNK-3 receptors compared with hNK-1 (>10,000-fold selective) and hNK-2 receptors (>140-fold selective), and selectivity was further demonstrated by its lack of effect, in concentrations up to 1 or 10 microM, in >60 receptor, enzyme and ion channel assays. SB 223412 enantioselectively inhibited the NKB-induced Ca++ mobilization in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the hNK-3 receptor. SB 223412 (10-1,000 nM) produced concentration-dependent rightward shifts in NKB-induced Ca++ mobilization concentration-response curves with a Kb value of 3 nM. In addition, SB 223412 antagonized senktide-induced contraction in the isolated rabbit iris sphincter muscle (Kb = 1.6 nM). In mice, oral administration of SB 223412 produced dose-dependent inhibition of behavioral responses induced by the NK-3 receptor-selective agonist, senktide (ED50 = 12.2 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic evaluation of SB 223412 in rat and dog indicated low plasma clearance, oral bioavailability and high and sustained plasma concentrations after 4 to 8 mg/kg oral dosages. The preclinical profile of SB 223412 (high affinity, selectivity, reversibility and oral activity) suggests that it will be a useful tool compound to define the physiological and pathophysiological roles of NK-3 receptors.",,

Accordingly, the contractile responses induced in isolated aortae by KCl, phenylephrine, angiotensin II and endothelin-1 were unaltered by SB-706375 (1 microM). 6. In summary, SB-706375 is a high-affinity, surmountable, reversible and selective nonpeptide UT receptor antagonist with cross-species activity that will assist in delineating the pathophysiological actions of U-II in mammals.",British journal of pharmacology,2005
7810882,Nonradioactive receptor binding assay for ciliary neurotrophic factor.,"A nonradioactive receptor binding assay for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is described. The assay is based on the interaction between biotinylated human CNTF, soluble gp130, and soluble myc-tagged CNTF receptor captured on a microtiter plate via an antibody against the myc epitope tag. Bound cytokine is revealed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin. Purified human and rat CNTF competed with biotinylated CNTF for receptor binding, with IC50 values of 29 and 2 nM, respectively. Since the higher affinity of rat vs human CNTF has been previously shown to be conferred by the arginine residue at position 63 of the rat protein, we also tested a human CNTF mutant carrying a Q63R substitution. Secreted forms of wild-type and mutant CNTF were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the amount of cytokines in periplasmic extracts was determined by quantitative Western blotting analysis. The human CNTF mutant (Q63R, N137S) was found to compete with biotinylated CNTF for binding to soluble CNTF receptor with an eightfold higher apparent affinity than wild-type human CNTF. The present method thus faithfully reproduces the relative activities of CNTF analogs determined in other assay systems. The possibility of assaying cytokines in crude bacterial extracts makes the new technique particularly suitable for rapidly determining the receptor binding potencies of genetically engineered CNTF variants.",,

Glycoprotein ligands on HSPCs help guide their migration to specialized microvascular beds in the bone marrow that express vascular selectins (E- and P-selectin). Here, we show that HSPC-enriched fractions from human hematopoietic tissue expressing CD34 (CD34",,
15906253,Notch in vertebrates--molecular aspects of the signal.,"Notch is a receptor consisting of a single path transmembrane protein which is essential for stem cell regulation in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We have investigated the function of Notch signaling and found that ligands of the Notch receptor (Delta and Serrate) sometimes act as receptor modulators in a cell autonomous manner; the balance of their activity as ligands explains satisfactorily 'lateral inhibition' as well as 'lateral specification'. This model explains not only fly morphogenesis, but also the general regulation of stem cells. In vertebrates, members of a novel family of genes which encode small secretory proteins, CCN, were demonstrated to bind to Notch and stimulate signaling. This is not a ligand type binding, but rather a modifier of the protein structure of Notch, so as to form a macromolecular complex. This association may open up novel perspectives on Notch signaling, for instance in the movement of cells involved in somite segmentation or angiogenesis. Thus, a well-conserved signal such as Notch seems to have changed in function during the evolution of vertebrates.",,
12814948,Notch signaling in primary endothelial cells.,"The Notch family of cell-surface receptors has been proposed to regulate cell-fate decisions by modulating the ability of each cell to respond to environmental cues. In vertebrates, gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies have demonstrated a requirement for Notch signaling for proper patterning of the vasculature during embryogenesis. To examine the molecular mechanisms by which Notch regulates vascular development, we analyzed changes in gene expression in response to Notch signaling. Notch signal transduction and function were assessed in primary human endothelial cells isolated from the dermal microvasculature of neonates, HMVECd. We demonstrate that HMVECd cells express a heterodimeric form of endogenous Notch4 on their cell surface. Using an in vitro coculture assay, we found that Delta4 can function as a ligand for Notch4 in HMVECd cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of an activated allele of Notch4 upregulated the expression of Delta4, suggesting that there may be a regulatory loop between Notch4 and its ligand, Delta4. Notch4 activation also induced the expression of the transcriptional repressors, HES1, HERP1, and HERP2, as well as ephrinB2, an angiogenic factor proposed to be involved in arterial/venous endothelial cell specification.",,
9620803,Notch-1 signalling requires ligand-induced proteolytic release of intracellular domain.,"Notch proteins are ligand-activated transmembrane receptors involved in cell-fate selection throughout development. No known enzymatic activity is contained within Notch and the molecular mechanism by which it transduces signals across the cell membrane is poorly understood. In many instances, Notch activation results in transcriptional changes in the nucleus through an association with members of the CSL family of DNA-binding proteins (where CSL stands for CBF1, Su(H), Lag-1). As Notch is located in the plasma membrane and CSL is a nuclear protein, two models have been proposed to explain how they interact. The first suggests that the two interact transiently at the membrane. The second postulates that Notch is cleaved by a protease, enabling the cleaved fragment to enter the nucleus. Here we show that signalling by a constitutively active membrane-bound Notch-1 protein requires the proteolytic release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which interacts preferentially with CSL. Very small amounts of NICD are active, explaining why it is hard to detect in the nucleus in vivo. We also show that it is ligand binding that induces release of NICD.",,
24563863,Notch1 and 4 signaling responds to an increasing vascular wall shear stress in a rat model of arteriovenous malformations.,"Notch signaling is suggested to promote the development and maintenance of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and an increasing wall shear stress (WSS) contributes to AVM rupture. Little is known about whether WSS impacts Notch signaling, which is important for understanding the angiogenesis of AVMs. WSS was measured in arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) surgically created in 96 rats at different time points over a period of 84 days. The expression of Notch receptors 1 and 4 and their ligands, Delta1 and 4, Jagged1, and Notch downstream gene target Hes1 was quantified in ""nidus"" vessels. The interaction events between Notch receptors and their ligands were quantified using proximity ligation assay. There was a positive correlation between WSS and time (r = 0.97; P < 0.001). The expression of Notch receptors and their ligands was upregulated following AVF formation. There was a positive correlation between time and the number of interactions between Notch receptors and their ligands aftre AVF formation (r = 0.62, P < 0.05) and a positive correlation between WSS and the number of interactions between Notch receptors and their ligands (r = 0.87, P < 0.005). In conclusion, an increasing WSS may contribute to the angiogenesis of AVMs by activation of Notch signaling.",,

12565884,Novel calcitonin-(8-32)-sensitive adrenomedullin receptors derived from co-expression of calcitonin receptor with receptor activity-modifying proteins.,"We tested whether heterodimers comprised of calcitonin (CT) receptor lacking the 16-amino acid insert in intracellular domain 1 (CTR(I1-)) and receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) can function not only as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors but also as adrenomedullin (AM) receptors. Whether transfected alone or together with RAMP, human (h)CTR(I1-) appeared mainly at the surface of HEK-293 cells. Expression of CTR(I1-) alone led to significant increases in cAMP in response to hCGRP or hAM, though both peptides remained about 100-fold less potent than hCT. However, the apparent potency of AM, like that of CGRP, approached that of CT when CTR(I1-) was co-expressed with RAMP. CGRP- or AM-evoked cAMP production was strongly inhibited by salmon CT-(8-32), a selective amylin receptor antagonist, but not by hCGRP-(8-37) or hAM-(22-52), antagonists of CGRP and AM receptors, respectively. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of CT-(8-32) were much stronger in cells co-expressing CTR(I1-) and RAMP than in cells expressing CTR(I1-) alone. Co-expression of CTR(I1-) with RAMP thus appears to produce functional CT-(8-32)-sensitive AM receptors.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2003
9152366,Novel cyclic peptide agonist of high potency and selectivity for the type II vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor.,"Ro 25-1392 [Ac-Glu8,OCH3-Tyr10,Lys12,Nle17,Ala19,A sp25,Leu26,-Lys27,28-vasoactive intestinal peptide(cyclo 21-25)] is a cyclic peptide analog of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) that potently exerts cellular effects typical of VIP. The selectivity of Ro 25-1392 for type I (VIPR1) and type II (VIPR2) VIP receptors was investigated first in competitive binding studies using Chinese hamster ovary cell transfectants stably expressing recombinant human VIPR1 and VIPR2. Nonradioactive Ro 25-1392 was as potent a competitive inhibitor as VIP for the binding of 125I-VIP to VIPR2 transfectants (Ki = 9.6 +/- 1.0 and 16 +/- 1.7 nM, respectively; mean +/- S.E.M., n = 4). In contrast, Ro 25-1392 had a very low affinity for VIPR1, compared with VIP, and attained a maximum of only 40% mean inhibition of binding of 125I-VIP at 1 microM. The affinity of VIP (Ki = 3.4 +/- 1.5 nM, mean +/- S.E.M., n = 4) for binding to VIPR1 was 1000-fold greater than that of Ro 25-1392. Ro 25-1392 evoked concurrent and concentration-dependent increases in intracellular levels of calcium and cyclic AMP (EC50 = 3.0 +/- 0.4 nM, mean +/- S.E.M., n = 4) in VIPR2 transfectants, but not in VIPR1 transfectants. The VIP receptor specificity of Ro 25-1392 was confirmed by preincubation of Chinese hamster ovary transfectants with 0.1 microM Ro 25-1392 for 18 hr at 37 degrees C, to down-regulate each type of VIP receptor. Pretreatment of VIPR2 transfectants with Ro 25-1392 decreased Bmax by a mean of 58% and VIP-induced increases in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP by a mean of 65%. In contrast, there was no significant change in VIPR1 transfectants after pretreatment with Ro 25-1392. Ro 25-1392 thus is selectively recognized by VIPR2, with consequent initiation of cyclic AMP and Ca+2 signals and down-regulation of VIPR2. This potent analog of VIP may prove useful for investigations of VIPR2-mediated physiological effects of VIP and exploration of the roles of VIPR2 in diseases.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,1997

29763370,Novel interleukin-33 and its soluble ST2 receptor as potential serum biomarkers in parotid gland tumors.,"An increasing number of patients with parotid gland tumors have been observed in recent years. The relationship between the immune system and tumor formation is thoroughly investigated. However, newly discovered molecules offer a new insight into the pathophysiology of malignancies. It would be ideal to find an easily determinable biomarker of tumor existence, its malignant potential or a biomarker suggesting the probability of disease recurrence. Our study is the first to examine serum concentrations of IL-33 and its sST2 receptor in patients with various types of parotid gland tumors. Serum IL33, sST2, IL-4 and IL-10 concentrations were determined in patients with benign and malignant parotid gland tumors (pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin's tumor, myoepithelioma and acinic cell carcinoma). We observed for the first time that serum IL-33 level was significantly elevated in patients with various types of parotid gland tumors and sST2 levels were significantly higher in pleomorphic adenoma and acinic cell carcinoma patients compared to the controls. Our results demonstrate for the first time that serum IL-33 and its sST2 receptor may be important factors in the pathology of parotid gland tumors. Although our results are promising, further investigations are required to detect if serum concentrations of those molecules may be a biomarker in parotid gland tumors. Impact statement Parotid gland tumors seem to be an increasingly important medical challenge, mostly due to a noticeable increase in the incidence. It would be crucial to find an easily determinable biomarker of tumor existence, its recurrence or malignant potential. We observed for the first time that serum IL-33 level was significantly elevated in patients with various types of parotid gland tumors and its sST2 receptor levels were significantly higher in pleomorphic adenoma and acinic cell carcinoma patients compared to the controls. We believe that our study helps to understand the biology of the tumors and a potential role of a relatively newly identified cytokine IL-33 in the pathophysiology of the parotid gland tumors.","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",2018
19696444,Novel mechanisms of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 regulation by extracellular matrix protein anosmin-1.,"Activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is initiated by a multiprotein complex formation between FGF, FGF receptor (FGFR), and heparan sulfate proteoglycan on the cell membrane. Cross-talk with other factors could affect this complex assembly and modulate the biological response of cells to FGF. We have previously demonstrated that anosmin-1, a glycosylated extracellular matrix protein, interacts with the FGFR1 signaling complex and enhances its activity in an IIIc isoform-specific and HS-dependent manner. The molecular mechanism of anosmin-1 action on FGFR1 signaling, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that anosmin-1 directly binds to FGFR1 with high affinity. This interaction involves domains in the N terminus of anosmin-1 (cysteine-rich region, whey acidic protein-like domain and the first fibronectin type III domain) and the D2-D3 extracellular domains of FGFR1. In contrast, anosmin-1 binds to FGFR2IIIc with much lower affinity and displays negligible binding to FGFR3IIIc. We also show that FGFR1-bound anosmin-1, although capable of binding to FGF2 alone, cannot bind to a FGF2.heparin complex, thus preventing FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex formation. By contrast, heparin-bound anosmin-1 binds to pre-formed FGF2.FGFR1 complex, generating an anosmin-1.FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex. Furthermore, a functional interaction between anosmin-1 and the FGFR1 signaling complex is demonstrated by immunofluorescence co-localization and Transwell migration assays where anosmin-1 was shown to induce opposing effects during chemotaxis of human neuronal cells. Our study provides molecular and cellular evidence for a modulatory action of anosmin-1 on FGFR1 signaling, whereby binding of anosmin-1 to FGFR1 and heparin can play a dual role in assembly and activity of the ternary FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex.",,

8700153,Novel natriuretic peptide receptor/guanylyl cyclase A-selective agonist inhibits angiotensin II- and forskolin-evoked aldosterone synthesis in a human zona glomerulosa cell line.,"We report the production of a novel human natriuretic peptide receptor/guanylyl cyclase A (hNPR-A)-selective agonist ANP [G9T, R11S, G16R] (sANP). This agonist has similar affinity to ANP for hNPR-A and 1,000-10,000-fold reduced affinity for the human natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (hNPR-C). sANP was used to directly test the hypothesis that hNPR-A mediates the inhibitory effect of natriuretic peptides on aldosterone generation in a human zona glomerulosa cell line, H295R. Human type A natriuretic peptide and sANP (10(-11) to 10(-6) M) resulted in concentration-dependent increases in cGMP levels and decreases in forskolin (100 nM)- and angiotensin II (5 nM)-induced aldosterone and pregnenolone production. These results revealed an inhibitory effect of both peptides on the agonist-stimulated conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone (i.e., cytochrome P-450 cholesterol monooxygenase side-chain cleaving enzyme, EC 1.14.15.6). H295R cells also exhibited angiotensin II- and forskolin-evoked conversion of [3H]cortico-sterone to [3H]aldosterone (i.e., cytochrome P-450 steroid 11 beta-monooxygenase/aldosterone synthase, EC 1.14.15.4). Human type A natriuretic peptide and sANP (10(-7) M) inhibited the angiotensin II-stimulated late pathway but did not affect forskolin-facilitated conversion of corticosterone to aldosterone. Our results directly demonstrate inhibitory effects of hNPR-A-mediated signal transduction on cytochrome P-450 cholesterol monooxygenase side-chain cleaving enzyme and steroid 11 beta-monooxygenase/aldosterone synthase complex depending on the steroidogenic agonist used.",Molecular pharmacology,1996

In competitive experiments using membranes prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the bradykinin receptor subtypes, FR167344 and FR173657 showed a high affinity binding to the B2 receptor with IC50 values of 65 and 8.9 nM, respectively, and no binding affinity for the B1 receptor. FR167344 and FR173657 inhibited the B2 receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis and produced a concentration-dependent rightward shift in the dose-response curve to bradykinin. This shift was accompanied by a progressive reduction of maximal response. Estimated pA2 values for the antagonism of bradykinin-induced PI hydrolysis by FR167344 and FR173657 were 8.0 and 9.0, respectively.

14514732,Obstructive uropathy in mice and humans: potential role for PDGF-D in the progression of tubulointerstitial injury.,"Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a major characteristic of progressive renal diseases. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a family of growth regulatory molecules consisting of PDGF-A and -B, along with the newly discovered PDGF-C and -D. They signal through cell membrane receptors, PDGF receptor alpha (PDGF-Ralpha) and receptor beta (PDGF-Rbeta). Involvement of PDGF-B and PDGF-Rbeta in the initiation and progression of renal fibrosis has been well documented. The authors studied the localization of PDGF ligands and receptors by immunohistochemistry, with emphasis on the role of PDGF-D in murine renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In mice with UUO, de novo expression of PDGF-D was detected in interstitial cells at day 4, which increased to maximal expression at day 14. Increased expression of PDGF-B by interstitial cells and in some tubules was observed after day 4. The diseased mice did not show augmentation of PDGF-A or PDGF-C proteins in the areas of fibrosis. PDGF-Ralpha and -Rbeta protein expression was increased in interstitial cells after day 4 and reached maximal expression at day 14. Human renal nephrectomies (n = 10) of chronic obstructive nephropathy demonstrated similar de novo expression of PDGF-D in interstitial cells, correlating with expression of PDGF-Rbeta and PDGF-B, as it did in the murine model. These observations suggest that PDGF-D plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial injury through binding of PDGF-Rbeta in both human obstructive nephropathy and the corresponding murine model of UUO.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2003
12068310,Oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein is a Nogo receptor ligand that inhibits neurite outgrowth.,"The inhibitory activity associated with myelin is a major obstacle for successful axon regeneration in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In addition to myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and Nogo-A, available evidence suggests the existence of additional inhibitors in CNS myelin. We show here that a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored CNS myelin protein, oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), is a potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. Like Nogo-A, OMgp contributes significantly to the inhibitory activity associated with CNS myelin. To further elucidate the mechanisms that mediate this inhibitory activity of OMgp, we screened an expression library and identified the Nogo receptor (NgR) as a high-affinity OMgp-binding protein. Cleavage of NgR and other GPI-linked proteins from the cell surface renders axons of dorsal root ganglia insensitive to OMgp. Introduction of exogenous NgR confers OMgp responsiveness to otherwise insensitive neurons. Thus, OMgp is an important inhibitor of neurite outgrowth that acts through NgR and its associated receptor complex. Interfering with the OMgp/NgR pathway may allow lesioned axons to regenerate after injury in vivo.",,

LIF is incapable of binding either high- or low-affinity OSM receptors, yet OSM is capable of binding the high-affinity but not the low-affinity LIF receptor.

OPC-41061 antagonized [3H]-AVP binding to human V2-receptors (Ki = 0.43 +/- 0.06 nM) more potently than AVP (Ki = 0. 78 +/- 0.08 nM) or OPC-31260 (Ki = 9.42 +/- 0.90 nM). OPC-41061 also inhibited [3H]-AVP binding to human V1a-receptors (Ki = 12.3 +/- 0.8 nM) but not to human V1b-receptors, indicating that OPC-41061 was 29 times more selective for V2-receptors than for V1a-receptors. OPC-41061 inhibited cAMP production induced by AVP with no intrinsic agonist activity. In rats, OPC-41061 inhibited [3H]-AVP binding to V1a-receptors (Ki = 325 +/- 41 nM) and V2-receptors (Ki = 1.33 +/- 0. 30 nM), showing higher receptor selectivity (V1a/V2 = 244) than with human receptors. A single oral administration of OPC-41061 in rats clearly produced dose-dependent aquaresis. In treatment by multiple OPC-41061 dosing for 28 days at 1 and 10 mg/kg p.o. in rats, significant aquaretic effects were seen throughout the study period. As the result of aquaresis, hemoconcentration was seen at 4 hr postdosing although, no differences were seen in serum osmolality, sodium, creatinine and urea nitrogen concentrations at 24 hr postdosing. Furthermore, there was no difference in serum AVP concentration, pituitary AVP content or the number and affinity of AVP receptors in the kidney and liver at trough throughout the study period. These results demonstrate that OPC-41061 is a highly potent human AVP V2-receptor antagonist and produces clear aquaresis after single and multiple dosing, suggesting the usefulness in the treatment of various water retaining states.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,1998

We screened 100 HLA class I proteins and found that KIR3DS1 bound to HLA-F, a result we confirmed biochemically and functionally. Primary human KIR3DS1(+) NK cells degranulated and produced antiviral cytokines after encountering HLA-F and inhibited HIV-1 replication in vitro. Activation of CD4(+) T cells triggered the transcription and surface expression of HLA-F mRNA and HLA-F protein, respectively, and induced binding of KIR3DS1. HIV-1 infection further increased the transcription of HLA-F mRNA but decreased the binding of KIR3DS1, indicative of a mechanism for evading recognition by KIR3DS1(+) NK cells. Thus, we have established HLA-F as a ligand of KIR3DS1 and have demonstrated cell-context-dependent expression of HLA-F that might explain the widespread influence of KIR3DS1 in human disease.",Nature immunology,2016

Robo3, a Robo family member, allows commissural axons to reach and cross the spinal cord midline by antagonizing Robo1/2-mediated repulsion from midline-expressed Slits and potentiating deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC)-mediated midline attraction to Netrin-1, but without binding either Slits or Netrins. We identified a secreted Robo3 ligand, neural epidermal growth factor-like-like 2 (NELL2), which repels mouse commissural axons through Robo3 and helps steer them to the midline. These findings identify NELL2 as an axon guidance cue and establish Robo3 as a multifunctional regulator of pathfinding that simultaneously mediates NELL2 repulsion, inhibits Slit repulsion, and facilitates Netrin attraction to achieve a common guidance purpose.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2015

16820893,Opioid growth factor receptor is unaltered with the progression of human pancreatic and colon cancers.,"Opioid growth factor (OGF) is an endogenous opioid peptide ([Met(5)]-enkephalin) that interacts with the OGF receptor (OGFr). OGF serves as a constitutively expressed and tonically active negative growth factor in neoplasia, and the OGF-OGFr axis contributes to the maintenance of an equilibrium in cell replication by targeting cyclin-dependent inhibitory kinase pathways. In a previous study, OGFr binding activity was found to decrease in concert with progression of human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). To investigate the relationship of OGFr to advancement of human pancreatic and colon cancers, tumor cells were transplanted into nude mice, and small, medium, and large neoplasias were assessed for OGFr number and affinity by receptor binding analysis, and for gene expression of OGFr mRNA by Northern blot analysis. In addition, OGF levels were monitored in plasma. OGFr binding affinity and capacity, as well as transcriptional activity of OGFr, were not influenced by the size or state of differentiation of pancreatic or colon tumors. Plasma levels of OGF were 3.5- to 7.9-fold less in animals with pancreatic or colon cancers than in nude mice not receiving xenografts, and no differences in OGF values were recorded between small and large tumors. These data on human pancreatic and colon cancers, along with information in earlier studies on SCCHN, indicate that alterations in the OGF receptor are dependent on tumor type and that the integrity of the OGF-OGFr axis insofar as tumorigenesis needs to be evaluated for each type of neoplasm. This information will be relevant in the design of therapeutic modalities, the diagnosis and prognosis of neoplasia, as well as understanding of the processes and mechanisms of carcinogenesis.",,
12208495,Orexin signaling in recombinant neuron-like cells.,"To assess the role of orexin receptor signaling in neuron-like cells, Neuro-2a murine neuroblastoma and PC12 human pheochromocytoma cells were stably transfected with human OX(1) or OX(2) receptors. Activation of both receptors strongly elevated cellular inositol phosphates and Ca(2+). A difference in the potency between orexin-A and -B was seen for OX(1), but not OX(2) receptors. Dependence of the orexin-mediated Ca(2+) response on extracellular Ca(2+) and the observed Ba(2+) influx indicate that in addition to phospholipase C, orexin receptors also may couple to similar non-voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in neuronal cells as previously characterized in non-neuronal cells.",FEBS letters,2002
9491897,Orexins and orexin receptors: a family of hypothalamic neuropeptides and G protein-coupled receptors that regulate feeding behavior.,"The hypothalamus plays a central role in the integrated control of feeding and energy homeostasis. We have identified two novel neuropeptides, both derived from the same precursor by proteolytic processing, that bind and activate two closely related (previously) orphan G protein-coupled receptors. These peptides, termed orexin-A and -B, have no significant structural similarities to known families of regulatory peptides. prepro-orexin mRNA and immunoreactive orexin-A are localized in neurons within and around the lateral and posterior hypothalamus in the adult rat brain. When administered centrally to rats, these peptides stimulate food consumption. prepro-orexin mRNA level is up-regulated upon fasting, suggesting a physiological role for the peptides as mediators in the central feedback mechanism that regulates feeding behavior.",,
15885496,Origin of the prolactin-releasing hormone (PRLH) receptors: evidence of coevolution between PRLH and a redundant neuropeptide Y receptor during vertebrate evolution.,"We present seven new vertebrate homologs of the prolactin-releasing hormone receptor (PRLHR) and show that these are found as two separate subtypes, PRLHR1 and PRLHR2. Analysis of a number of vertebrate sequences using phylogeny, pharmacology, and paralogon analysis indicates that the PRLHRs are likely to share a common ancestry with the neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors. Moreover, a micromolar level of NPY was able to bind and inhibit completely the PRLH-evoked response in PRLHR1-expressing cells. We suggest that an ancestral PRLH peptide started coevolving with a redundant NPY binding receptor, which then became PRLHR, approximately 500 million years ago. The PRLHR1 subtype was shown to have a relatively high evolutionary rate compared to receptors with fixed peptide preference, which could indicate a drastic change in binding preference, thus supporting this hypothesis. This report suggests how gene duplication events can lead to novel peptide ligand/receptor interactions and hence spur the evolution of new physiological functions.",Genomics,2005
11015293,Orphan-receptor ligand human urotensin II: receptor localization in human tissues and comparison of vasoconstrictor responses with endothelin-1.,"We have determined the distribution of receptors for human urotensin-II (U-II) in human and rat CNS and peripheral tissues. In rat, [(125)I]-U-II binding density was highest in the abducens nucleus of brainstem (139.6+/-14 amol mm(-2)). Moderate levels were detected in dorsal horn of spinal cord and lower levels in aorta (22. 5+/-6 amol mm(-2)). In human tissues density was highest in skeletal muscle and cerebral cortex ( approximately 30 amol mm(-2)), with lower levels (<15 amol mm(-2)) in kidney cortex and left ventricle. Little binding was identified in atria, conducting system of the heart and lung parenchyma. Receptor density was less in human coronary artery smooth muscle (14.6+/-3 amol mm(-2), n=10) than rat aorta with no significant difference between normal and atherosclerotic vessels. In human skeletal muscle [(125)I]-U-II bound to a single receptor population with K(D)=0.24+/-0.17 nM and B(max)=1.97+/-1.1 fmol mg(-1) protein (n=4). U-II contracted human coronary, mammary and radial arteries, saphenous and umbilical veins with sub-nanomolar EC(50) values. U-II was 50 times more potent in arteries and <10 times more potent in veins than endothelin-1 (ET-1). The maximum response to U-II ( approximately 20% of control KCl) was significantly less than to ET-1 ( approximately 80% KCl). In contrast, in rat aorta, U-II and ET-1 were equipotent with similar maximum responses. This is the first report of high affinity receptors for [(125)I]-U-II in human CNS and peripheral tissues. This peptide produces potent, low efficacy, vasoconstriction in human arteries and veins. These data suggest a potential role for U-II in human physiology.",,
7481766,Orphanin FQ: a neuropeptide that activates an opioidlike G protein-coupled receptor.,"A heptadecapeptide was identified and purified from porcine brain tissue as a ligand for an orphan heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor (LC132) that is similar in sequence to opioid receptors. This peptide, orphanin FQ, has a primary structure reminiscent of that of opioid peptides. Nanomolar concentrations of orphanin FQ inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in cells transfected with LC132. This inhibitory activity was not affected by the addition of opioid ligands, nor did the peptide activate opioid receptors. Orphanin FQ bound to its receptor in a saturable manner and with high affinity. When injected intracerebroventricularly into mice, orphanin FQ caused a decrease in locomotor activity but did not induce analgesia in the hot-plate test. However, the peptide produced hyperalgesia in the tail-flick assay. Thus, orphanin FQ may act as a transmitter in the brain by modulating nociceptive and locomotor behavior.",,
9520411,Osteoclast differentiation factor is a ligand for osteoprotegerin/osteoclastogenesis-inhibitory factor and is identical to TRANCE/RANKL.,"Osteoclasts, the multinucleated cells that resorb bone, develop from hematopoietic cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage. Osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) are formed by coculturing spleen cells with osteoblasts or bone marrow stromal cells in the presence of bone-resorbing factors. The cell-to-cell interaction between osteoblasts/stromal cells and osteoclast progenitors is essential for OCL formation. Recently, we purified and molecularly cloned osteoclastogenesis-inhibitory factor (OCIF), which was identical to osteoprotegerin (OPG). OPG/OCIF is a secreted member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and inhibits osteoclastogenesis by interrupting the cell-to-cell interaction. Here we report the expression cloning of a ligand for OPG/OCIF from a complementary DNA library of mouse stromal cells. The protein was found to be a member of the membrane-associated tumor necrosis factor ligand family and induced OCL formation from osteoclast progenitors. A genetically engineered soluble form containing the extracellular domain of the protein induced OCL formation from spleen cells in the absence of osteoblasts/stromal cells. OPG/OCIF abolished the OCL formation induced by the protein. Expression of its gene in osteoblasts/stromal cells was up-regulated by bone-resorbing factors. We conclude that the membrane-bound protein is osteoclast differentiation factor (ODF), a long-sought ligand mediating an essential signal to osteoclast progenitors for their differentiation into osteoclasts. ODF was found to be identical to TRANCE/RANKL, which enhances T-cell growth and dendritic-cell function. ODF seems to be an important regulator in not only osteoclastogenesis but also immune system.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1998
17951249,Osteocrin is a specific ligand of the natriuretic Peptide clearance receptor that modulates bone growth.,"Osteocrin (Ostn) is a recently discovered secreted protein produced by cells of the osteoblast lineage that shows a well conserved homology with members of the natriuretic peptide (NP) family. We hypothesized that Ostn could interact with the NP receptors, thereby modulating NP actions on the skeleton. Ostn binds specifically and saturably to the NP peptide receptor-C (NPR-C) receptor with a Kd of approximately 5 nM with no binding to the GC-A or GC-B receptors. Deletion of several of the residues deemed important for NP binding to NPR-C led to abolition of Ostn binding, confirming the presence of a ""natriuretic motif."" Functionally, Ostn was able to augment C-type natriuretic peptide-stimulated cGMP production in both pre-chondrocytic (ATDC5) and osteoblastic (UMR106) cells, suggesting increased NP levels due to attenuation of NPR-C associated NP clearance. Ostn-transgenic mice displayed elongated bones and a marked kyphosis associated with elevated bone cGMP levels, suggesting that elevated natriuretic peptide activity contributed to the increased bone length possibly through an increase in growth plate chondrocyte proliferation. Thus, we have demonstrated that Ostn is a naturally occurring ligand of the NPR-C clearance receptor and may act to locally modulate the actions of the natriuretic system in bone by blocking the clearance action of NPR-C, thus locally elevating levels of C-type natriuretic peptide.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2007
7790373,Osteogenic protein-1 binds to activin type II receptors and induces certain activin-like effects.,"Proteins in the TGF-beta superfamily transduce their effects through binding to type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. Osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1, also known as bone morphogenetic protein-7 or BMP-7), a member of the TGF-beta superfamily which belongs to the BMP subfamily, was found to bind activin receptor type I (ActR-I), and BMP receptors type IA (BMPR-IA) and type IB (BMPR-IB) in the presence of activin receptors type II (ActR-II) and type IIB (ActR-IIB). The binding affinity of OP-1 to ActR-II was two- to threefold lower than that of activin A. A transcriptional activation signal was transduced after binding of OP-1 to the complex of ActR-I and ActR-II, or that of BMPR-IB and ActR-II. These results indicate that ActR-II can act as a functional type II receptor for OP-1, as well as for activins. Some of the known biological effects of activin were observed for OP-1, including growth inhibition and erythroid differentiation induction. Compared to activin, OP-1 was shown to be a poor inducer of mesoderm in Xenopus embryos. Moreover, follistatin, an inhibitor of activins, was found to inhibit the effects of OP-1, if added at a 10-fold excess. However, certain effects of activin, like induction of follicle stimulating hormone secretion in rat pituitary cells were not observed for OP-1. OP-1 has overlapping binding specificities with activins, and shares certain but not all of the functional effects of activins. Thus, OP-1 may have broader effects in vivo than hitherto recognized.",,
15799029,Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is localized to the Weibel-Palade bodies of human vascular endothelial cells and is physically associated with von Willebrand factor.,"Recent studies demonstrate roles for osteoprotegerin (OPG) in both skeletal and extra-skeletal tissues. Although its role in preventing osteoclast (OC) formation and activity is well documented, emerging evidence suggests a role of OPG in endothelial cell survival and the prevention of arterial calcification. In this communication, we show that vascular endothelial cells in situ, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro, express abundant OPG. In HUVEC, OPG co-localizes with P-selectin and von Willebrand factor (vWF), within the Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB). Treatment of HUVEC with the pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-1beta, resulted in mobilization from the WPBs and subsequent secretion of OPG protein into the culture supernatant. Furthermore, TNF-alpha treatment of HUVEC resulted in a sustained increase in OPG mRNA levels and protein secretion over the 24-h treatment period. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that while not associated with P-Selectin, OPG is physically complexed with vWF both within the WPB and following secretion from endothelial cells. Interestingly, this association was also identified in human peripheral blood plasma. In addition to its interaction with vWF, we show that OPG also binds with high avidity to the vWF reductase, thrombospondin (TSP-1), raising the intriguing possibility that OPG may provide a link between TSP-1 and vWF. In summary, the intracellular localization of OPG in HUVEC, in association with vWF, together with its rapid and sustained secretory response to inflammatory stimuli, strongly support a modulatory role in vascular injury, inflammation and hemostasis.",,
9568710,Osteoprotegerin ligand is a cytokine that regulates osteoclast differentiation and activation.,"The ligand for osteoprotegerin has been identified, and it is a TNF-related cytokine that replaces the requirement for stromal cells, vitamin D3, and glucocorticoids in the coculture model of in vitro osteoclastogenesis. OPG ligand (OPGL) binds to a unique hematopoeitic progenitor cell that is committed to the osteoclast lineage and stimulates the rapid induction of genes that typify osteoclast development. OPGL directly activates isolated mature osteoclasts in vitro, and short-term administration into normal adult mice results in osteoclast activation associated with systemic hypercalcemia. These data suggest that OPGL is an osteoclast differentiation and activation factor. The effects of OPGL are blocked in vitro and in vivo by OPG, suggesting that OPGL and OPG are key extracellular regulators of osteoclast development.",,

Systemic deletion of Postn results in peripheral blood (PB) anaemia, myelomonocytosis and lymphopenia, while the number of phenotypic HSCs increases in the bone marrow. Postn",,
1377404,Overlapping but nonidentical binding sites on CD2 for CD58 and a second ligand CD59.,"The interaction of the T cell glycoprotein CD2 with one ligand, CD58, contributes to T cell function. We have identified CD59, a glycoprotein with complement-inhibitory function, as a second physiological ligand for CD2. Antibodies to CD59 inhibit CD2-dependent T cell activation in murine T cell hybridomas expressing human CD2. In an in vitro binding assay with purified CD58 and CD59, CD2+ cells bind not only immobilized CD58 but also CD59. With two complementary approaches, it was demonstrated that the binding sites on CD2 for CD58 and CD59 are overlapping but nonidentical. These observations suggest that direct interactions between CD2 and both CD58 and CD59 contribute to T cell activation and adhesion.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1992
12429744,PAC1 receptor activation by PACAP-38 mediates Ca2+ release from a cAMP-dependent pool in human fetal adrenal gland chromaffin cells.,"Previous studies have shown that human fetal adrenal gland from 17- to 20-week-old fetuses expressed pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptors, which were localized on chromaffin cells. The aim of the present study was to identify PACAP receptor isoforms and to determine whether PACAP can affect intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and catecholamine secretion. Using primary cultures and specific stimulation of chromaffin cells, we demonstrate that PACAP-38 induced an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) that was blocked by PACAP (6-38), was independent of external Ca(2+), and originated from thapsigargin-insensitive internal stores. The PACAP-triggered Ca(2+) increase was not affected by inhibition of PLC beta (preincubation with U-73122) or by pretreatment of cells with Xestospongin C, indicating that the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive stores were not mobilized. However, forskolin (FSK), which raises cytosolic cAMP, induced an increase in Ca(2+) similar to that recorded with PACAP-38. Blockage of PKA by H-89 or (R(p))-cAMPS suppressed both PACAP-38 and FSK calcium responses. The effect of PACAP-38 was also abolished by emptying the caffeine/ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) stores. Furthermore, treatment of cells with orthovanadate (100 microm) impaired Ca(2+) reloading of PACAP-sensitive stores indicating that PACAP-38 can mobilize Ca(2+) from secretory vesicles. Moreover, PACAP induced catecholamine secretion by chromaffin cells. It is concluded that PACAP-38, through the PAC(1) receptor, acts as a neurotransmitter in human fetal chromaffin cells inducing catecholamine secretion, through nonclassical, recently described, ryanodine/caffeine-sensitive pools, involving a cAMP- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation mechanism.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
20802527,Pancreatic adenocarcinoma upregulated factor promotes metastasis by regulating TLR/CXCR4 activation.,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma upregulated factor (PAUF) is overproduced in certain types of cancer. However, little is known of the tumorigenic function of PAUF. In this study, we report the X-ray crystal structure of PAUF and reveal that PAUF is a mammalian lectin normally found in plant lectins. We also identify PAUF as an endogenous ligand of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 by screening extracellular domain receptor pools. We further confirmed the specificity of the PAUF-TLR2 interaction. PAUF induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and activates the IKK-β-mediated TPL2/MEK/ERK signaling pathway through TLR2. In agreement with the result of TLR2-mediated ERK activation by PAUF, PAUF induces increased expression of the protumorigenic cytokines RANTES and MIF in THP-1 cells. However, PAUF does not fully activate Iκ-B-α signaling pathways in THP-1 cells, and fails to translocate the p65 subunit of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) complex into the nucleus, resulting in no NF-κB activation. Surprisingly, we found that PAUF also associated with the CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR4)-TLR2 complex and inhibited CXCR4-dependent, TLR2-mediated NF-κB activation. Together, these findings suggest that the new cancer-associated ligand, PAUF, may activate TLR-mediated ERK signaling to produce the protumorigenic cytokines, but inhibits TLR-mediated NF-κB signaling, thereby facilitating tumor growth and escape from innate immune surveillance.",,
12732212,"PAR-3 is a low-affinity substrate, high affinity effector of thrombin.","A polypeptide corresponding to the extracellular domain of protease-activated receptor 3 (PAR-3) is hydrolyzed by thrombin slowly because of high K(M) (>100 microM). However, thrombin is found to bind two PAR-3, one without catalyzing hydrolysis or blocking the active site, while the other is hydrolyzed. In a solvent lacking Na(+), hydrolysis of a nitroanilide substrate is enhanced 1.6-fold by addition of PAR-3 polypeptide, with half-saturation at 2.5 microM. In contrast, the fibrinogen clotting activity of thrombin is inhibited completely by PAR-3, with a K(I) of 3 microM. None of the activities of thrombin are affected by addition of 50 microM PAR-4 polypeptide. Thus, PAR-3 in low concentrations binds thrombin in a configuration that blocks the anion-binding exosite but not the catalytic site, while hydrolysis of PAR-3, PAR-4, and other substrates that do not interact with exosite I persists. The allosteric effect of PAR-3 is characteristic of that of Na(+).",,
10644723,PAR1 thrombin receptor-G protein interactions. Separation of binding and coupling determinants in the galpha subunit.,"Signal transfer between the protease-activated PAR1 thrombin receptor and membrane-associated heterotrimeric G proteins is mediated by protein-protein interactions. We constructed a yeast signaling system that resolves domain-specific functions of binding from coupling in the Galpha subunit. The endogenous yeast Galpha subunit, Gpa1, does not bind to PAR1 and served as a null structural template. N- and C-terminal portions of mammalian G(i2) and G(16) were substituted back into the Gpa1 template and gain-of-function assessed. The C-terminal third of G(16), but not of G(i2), provides sufficient interactions for coupling to occur with PAR1. The N-terminal two-thirds of G(i2) also contains sufficient determinants to bind and couple to PAR1 and overcome the otherwise negative or missing interactions supplied by the C-terminal third of Gpa1. Replacement of the N-terminal alpha-helix of G(i2), residues 1-34, with those of Gpa1 abolishes coupling but not binding to PAR1 or to betagamma subunits. These data support a model that the N-terminal alphaN helix of the Galpha subunit is physically interposed between PAR1 and the Gbeta subunit and directly assists in transferring the signal between agonist-activated receptor and G protein.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000

12967935,Partial agonist behaviour depends upon the level of nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor expression: studies using the ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression system.,"(1) Partial agonism is primarily dependent upon receptor density and coupling efficiency. As these parameters are tissue/model dependent, intrinsic activity in different tissues can vary. We have utilised the ecdysone-inducible expression system containing the human nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide receptor (hNOP) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOINDhNOP) to examine the activity of a range of partial agonists in receptor binding, GTPgamma35S binding and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase studies. (2) Incubation of CHOINDhNOP cells with ponasterone A (PON) induced hNOP expression ([leucyl-3H]N/OFQ binding) of 24, 68, 191 and 1101 fmol mg-1 protein at 1, 2, 5 and 10 microm PON, respectively. At 191 fmol mg-1, protein hNOP pharmacology was identical to that reported for other traditional expression systems. (3) pEC50 values for GTPgamma35S binding ranged from 7.23 to 7.72 (2-10 microm PON) for the partial agonist [Phe1psi(CH2-NH)Gly2]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 ([F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2) and 8.12-8.60 (1-10 microm PON) for N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and Emax values (stimulation factor relative to basal) ranged from 1.51 to 3.21 (2-10 microm PON) for [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and 1.28-6.95 (1-10 microm) for N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2. Intrinsic activity of [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 relative to N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 was 0.3-0.5. [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 did not stimulate GTPgamma35S binding at 1 microm PON, but competitively antagonised the effects of N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 with a pKB=7.62. (4) pEC50 values for cAMP inhibition ranged from 8.26 to 8.32 (2-10 microm PON) for [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and 9.42-10.35 for N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and Emax values (% inhibition) ranged from 19.6 to 83.2 for [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and 40.9-86.0 for N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2. The intrinsic activity of [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 relative to N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 was 0.48-0.97. (5) In the same cellular environment with receptor density as the only variable, we show that the profile of [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 can be manipulated to encompass full and partial agonism along with antagonism.",,
10772816,Participation of syndecan 2 in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1: structural characteristics of heparan sulfate chains with avidity to COOH-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin.,"The present study provides direct evidence that syndecan 2 participates selectively in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1 through specific binding of its heparan sulfate side chains to the fibronectin substrate. Our previous study with Lewis lung carcinoma-derived P29 cells demonstrated that the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which binds to fibronectin, is syndecan 2 (N. Itano et al., 1996, Biochem. J. 315, 925-930). We here report that in vitro treatment of the cells by antisense oligonucleotide for syndecan 2 resulted in a failure to form stress fibers on fibronectin substrate in association with specific suppression of its cell surface expression. Instead, localization of actin filaments in the cytoplasmic cortex occurred. A similar response of the cells was observed when the cells were treated to eliminate functions of cell surface heparan sulfates, including exogenous addition of heparin and pretreatment with anti-heparan sulfate antibody, F58-10E4, and with proteinase-free heparitinase I. Size- and structure-defined oligosaccharides prepared from heparin and chemically modified heparins were utilized as competitive inhibitors to examine the structural characteristics of the cell surface heparan sulfates involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Their affinity chromatography on a column linked with a recombinant H-271 peptide containing a C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin demonstrated that 2-O-sulfated iduronates were essential for the binding. Inhibition studies revealed that a heparin-derived dodecasaccharide sample enriched with an IdoA(2OS)-GlcNS(6OS) disaccharide completely blocked binding of the syndecan 2 ectodomain to immobilized H-271 peptide. Finally, the dodecasaccharide sample was shown to inhibit stress fiber formation, triggered by adhesion of P29 cells to a CH-271 polypeptide consisting of both the RGD cell-binding and the C-terminal heparin-binding domains of fibronectin in a fused form. All these results consistently suggest that syndecan 2 proteoglycan interacts with the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin at the highly sulfated cluster(s), such as [IdoA(2OS)-GlcNS(6OS)](6) present in its heparan sulfate chains, to result in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1.",Experimental cell research,2000
14714274,Pathogenic mutations associated with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy differently affect Jagged1 binding and Notch3 activity via the RBP/JK signaling Pathway.,"Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited vascular dementia characterized by the degeneration of smooth-muscle cells in small cerebral arteries. CADASIL is caused by mutations in NOTCH3, one of the four mammalian homologs to the Drosophila melanogaster NOTCH gene. Disease-associated mutations are distributed throughout the 34 epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGFRs) that compose the extracellular domain of the Notch3 receptor and result in a loss or a gain of a cysteine residue in one of these EGFRs. In human adults, Notch3 expression is highly restricted to vascular smooth-muscle cells. In patients with CADASIL, there is an abnormal accumulation of Notch3 in the vessel. Molecular pathways linking NOTCH3 mutations to degeneration of vascular smooth-muscle cells are as yet poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of CADASIL mutations on Notch3 activity. We studied five naturally occurring mutations: R90C and C212S, located in the previously identified mutational hotspot EGFR2-5; C428S, shown in this study to be located in the ligand-binding domain EGFR10-11; and C542Y and R1006C, located in EGFR13 and EGFR26, respectively. All five mutant proteins were correctly processed. The C428S and C542Y mutant receptors exhibited a significant reduction in Jagged1-induced transcriptional activity of a RBP/JK responsive luciferase reporter, relative to wild-type Notch3. Impaired signaling activity of these two mutants arose through different mechanisms; the C428S mutant lost its Jagged1-binding ability, whereas C542Y retained it but exhibited an impaired presentation to the cell surface. In contrast, the R90C, C212S, and R1006C mutants retained the ability to bind Jagged1 and were associated with apparently normal levels of signaling activity. We conclude that mutations in Notch3 differently affect Jagged1 binding and Notch3 signaling via the RBP/JK pathway.",American journal of human genetics,2004
27708076,Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiated by binding lymphocyte-activation gene 3.,"Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) may be due to cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded preformed fibrils (PFF) of α-synuclein (α-syn). The mechanism by which α-syn PFF spreads from neuron to neuron is not known. Here, we show that LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) binds α-syn PFF with high affinity (dissociation constant = 77 nanomolar), whereas the α-syn monomer exhibited minimal binding. α-Syn-biotin PFF binding to LAG3 initiated α-syn PFF endocytosis, transmission, and toxicity. Lack of LAG3 substantially delayed α-syn PFF-induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo. The identification of LAG3 as a receptor that binds α-syn PFF provides a target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related α-synucleinopathies.",,
20587542,PD-L1 and PD-L2 differ in their molecular mechanisms of interaction with PD-1.,"The programmed death-1 (PD-1) molecule is involved in peripheral tolerance and in the immune escape mechanisms during chronic viral infections and cancer. PD-1 interacts with two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms of PD-1 interactions with its ligands by surface plasmon resonance and cell surface binding as well as the ability of the two ligands to compete for PD-1 binding. PD-L1 and PD-L2 bound PD-1 with comparable affinities, but striking differences were observed at the level of the association and dissociation characteristics. PD-L1, but not PD-L2, had a delayed interaction reminiscent of a phenomenon of conformational transition. These mechanisms were confirmed by using PD-L1 mAbs that delayed the dissociation of PD-L1 from PD-1. This mechanism was not restricted to PD-1 binding since PD-L1 behaved in a similar manner with its second ligand, CD80. Finally, we could demonstrate that PD-L1 and PD-L2 competed for PD-1 binding and conversely, an antagonist PD-1 mAb blocked both PD-L1 and PD-L2 binding to PD-1 and strongly enhanced T-cell proliferation. These data further emphasize the differential molecular mechanisms of interaction of PD-L1 and PD-L2 with PD-1, and suggest possible new approach for the therapy of chronic infection, cancer and transplantation.",,
10806482,PDGF-C is a new protease-activated ligand for the PDGF alpha-receptor.,"Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) are important in many types of mesenchymal cell. Here we identify a new PDGF, PDGF-C, which binds to and activates the PDGF alpha-receptor. PDGF-C is activated by proteolysis and induces proliferation of fibroblasts when overexpressed in transgenic mice. In situ hybridization analysis in the murine embryonic kidney shows preferential expression of PDGF-C messenger RNA in the metanephric mesenchyme during epithelial conversion. Analysis of kidneys lacking the PDGF alpha-receptor shows selective loss of mesenchymal cells adjacent to sites of expression of PDGF-C mRNA; this is not found in kidneys from animals lacking PDGF-A or both PDGF-A and PDGF-B, indicating that PDGF-C may have a unique function.",,
19795151,PDGF-CC induces tissue factor expression: role of PDGF receptor alpha/beta.,"Tissue factor (TF) is the principal trigger of the coagulation cascade and involved in arterial thrombus formation. Platelet-derived growth factor CC (PDGF-CC) is a recently discovered member of the PDGF family released upon platelet activation. This study assesses the impact of PDGF-CC on TF expression in human cells. PDGF-CC concentration-dependently induced TF expression by 2.5-fold in THP-1 cells, by 2.0-fold in human peripheral blood monocytes, by 1.4-fold in vascular smooth muscle cells, and by 2.6-fold in microvascular endothelial cells, but did not affect TF expression in aortic endothelial cells. A similar pattern was observed with PDGF-BB. In contrast, PDGF-AA did not alter TF expression in THP-1 cells. TF whole cell activity was induced following stimulation with PDGF-BB and PDGF-CC in THP-1 cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that PDGF-CC induced TF mRNA. PDGF-CC transiently activated p42/44 MAP kinase [extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)], while phosphorylation of the MAP kinases c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 remained unaffected. PD98059, a specific inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation, but not the p38 inhibitor SB203580 or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 prevented PDGF-CC induced TF expression in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of PDGF-CC was antagonized by both PDGF receptor alpha and PDGF receptor beta neutralizing antibodies; in contrast, PDGF-BB was only inhibited by PDGF receptor beta blocking antibody. PDGF receptor alpha and PDGF receptor beta inhibition prevented PDGF-CC-induced ERK phosphorylation. PDGF-CC induces TF expression via activation of alpha/beta receptor heterodimers and an ERK-dependent signal transduction pathway.",,
9707552,PDZ-domain-mediated interaction of the Eph-related receptor tyrosine kinase EphB3 and the ras-binding protein AF6 depends on the kinase activity of the receptor.,"Eph-related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have been implicated in intercellular communication during embryonic development. To elucidate their signal transduction pathways, we applied the yeast two-hybrid system. We could demonstrate that the carboxyl termini of the Eph-related RTKs EphA7, EphB2, EphB3, EphB5, and EphB6 interact with the PDZ domain of the ras-binding protein AF6. A mutational analysis revealed that six C-terminal residues of the receptors are involved in binding to the PDZ domain of AF6 in a sequence-specific fashion. Moreover, this PDZ domain also interacts with C-terminal sequences derived from other transmembrane receptors such as neurexins and the Notch ligand Jagged. In contrast to the association of EphB3 to the PDZ domain of AF6, the interaction with full-length AF6 clearly depends on the kinase activity of EphB3, suggesting a regulated mechanism for the PDZ-domain-mediated interaction. These data gave rise to the idea that the binding of AF6 to EphB3 occurs in a cooperative fashion because of synergistic effects involving different epitopes of both proteins. Moreover, in NIH 3T3 and NG108 cells endogenous AF6 is phosphorylated specifically by EphB3 and EphB2 in a ligand-dependent fashion. Our observations add the PDZ domain to the group of conserved protein modules such as Src-homology-2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains that regulate signal transduction through their ability to mediate the interaction with RTKs.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1998
9488691,Peptides derived from the complementarity-determining regions of anti-Mac-1 antibodies block intercellular adhesion molecule-1 interaction with Mac-1.,"Peptides or small molecules that can block the interaction of the integrin Mac-1 with its receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), have not previously been developed. We studied this interaction by measuring the adherence of ICAM-1-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to immobilized, purified Mac-1. Nucleotide sequence information was obtained for the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of three antibodies (44aacb, MY904, and 118.1) shown to block Mac-1-mediated cell adherence. Peptides were synthesized based on the predicted amino acid sequences of the CDRs and tested for the ability to block cell adhesion to Mac-1. Peptides derived from CDR1 of 44aacb, CDR2 of 118.1, and CDRs 1 and 3 of MY904 heavy chains were found to possess blocking activity at 10-100 muM. This may indicate that one or two CDRs contribute disproportionately to the antibody binding affinity. The binding of ligands to Mac-1 has been shown to require a region of the alpha-chain known as the I- or A-domain. We have recombinantly produced Mac-1 I-domain, and show that it is also capable of supporting the adherence of ICAM-1-expressing CHO cells. The adherence of ICAM-1-CHO cells to the I-domain is inhibited by 44aacb and 118.1 and by the CDR peptides from 44aacb and 118.1. By using phage display of peptide libraries based on the 118.1 CDR peptide with five residues randomized, we were able to identify a novel peptide inhibitor of Mac-1 with substitutions at all five positions. These peptides provide lead structures for development of Mac-1 antagonists.",,
16200075,Pericellular activation of proMMP-7 (promatrilysin-1) through interaction with CD151.,"Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) (also known as matrilysin-1) is secreted as a proenzyme (proMMP-7) and plays a key role in the degradation of various extracellular matrix (ECM) and non-ECM molecules after activation. To identify the binding proteins related to proMMP-7 activation, a human lung cDNA library was screened by yeast two-hybrid system using proMMP-7 as bait. We identified a candidate molecule CD151, which is a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily. Complex formation of proMMP-7 with CD151 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of the molecules from CaR-1 cells, a human rectal carcinoma cell line, expressing both proMMP-7 and CD151, and CD151 stable transfectants incubated with proMMP-7. Yeast two-hybrid assays using deletion mutants of proMMP-7 and CD151 suggested an interaction between the propeptide of proMMP-7 and the COOH-terminal extracellular loop of CD151. The binding activity of (125)I-labeled proMMP-7 to CD151 on the cell membranes was shown with CD151 stable transfectants. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy demonstrated that proMMP-7 colocalizes with CD151 on the cell membranes of CD151 stable transfectants and CaR-1 cells. In situ zymography using crosslinked carboxymethylated transferrin, a substrate of MMP-7, demonstrated proteinase activity on and around CD151 stable transfectants and CaR-1 cells, while the activity was abolished by their treatment with MMP inhibitors, anti-MMP-7 antibody or anti-CD151 antibody. In human lung adenocarcinoma tissues, colocalization of MMP-7 and CD151 was demonstrated on the carcinoma cells. Metalloproteinase activity was present in these tissues and could be inhibited by antibodies to MMP-7 or CD151. These data demonstrate for the first time that proMMP-7 is captured and activated on the cell membranes through interaction with CD151, and suggest the possibility that similar to the MT1-MMP/MMP-2 system, MMP-7 is involved in the pericellular activation mechanism mediated by CD151, a crucial step in proteolysis on the cell membranes under various pathophysiological conditions including cancer invasion and metastasis.",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2005
30348980,Periostin secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts promotes cancer stemness in head and neck cancer by activating protein tyrosine kinase 7.,"Protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play important roles in cancer stemness, respectively. However, little is known about interaction between CAFs and PTK7 in cancers. In this study, we showed that PTK7 was significantly correlated with the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway and aggressive clinicopathologic features in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Meanwhile, animal experiments showed that PTK7 enhanced chemoresistance and lung metastasis of HNSCC in vivo. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay demonstrated that POSTN secreted by CAFs was a potential upstream ligand of PTK7 which might act as a receptor. Further analysis revealed that POSTN promoted the cancer stem cell (CSC)-like phenotype via PTK7-Wnt/β-Catenin signaling, including the proliferation and invasion of HNSCC cells in vitro, as well as tumor initiation and progression in vivo. Collectively, our study proved that CAF-derived POSTN might promote cancer stemness via interacting with PTK7 in HNSCC, suggesting that the combination of POSTN and PTK7 might be a potential prognostic and diagnostic indicator and a  promising therapeutic target.",,
20350599,Persephin signaling through GFRalpha1: the potential for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.,"Neurotrophic factors promote survival, proliferation and differentiation of neurons inducing intracellular signaling via specific receptors. The conventional biochemical methods often fail to reveal full repertoire of neurotrophic factor-receptor interactions because of their limited sensitivity. We evaluated several approaches to study signaling of Glial cell line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) family ligands and found that reporter-gene systems possess exceptionally high sensitivity and a heuristic power to identify novel biologically relevant growth factor-receptor interactions. We identified persephin, a GDNF family member, as a novel ligand for GFRalpha1/RET receptor complex. We confirmed this finding by several independent methods, including neurite outgrowth assay from the explants of sympathetic ganglia expressing Gfralpha1 and Ret mRNA but not persephin's conventional receptor GFRalpha4. As the activation of GFRalpha1/RET was shown to rescue dopaminergic neurons, our results suggest the potential of persephin for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",Molecular and cellular neurosciences,2010
9808667,Pharmacological and biochemical characterization of a recombinant human galanin GALR1 receptor: agonist character of chimeric galanin peptides.,"The galanin neuropeptide system is widely distributed throughout the brain and periphery and is thought to play a role in feeding, pain and reproduction. To evaluate the human galanin receptor 1 as a potential therapeutic target, we fully characterized its interaction with several galanin-like peptides. The human galanin receptor 1 receptor was stably expressed using an episomal system in human embryonic kidney 293E cells. Saturation isotherms using 125I-human galanin revealed two distinct populations of receptor affinity states in membranes and whole cells with picomolar and nanomolar affinities at the high- and low affinity states, respectively. A scintillation proximity assay revealed that 125I-human galanin binding in membranes reached steady-state within 2 to 2.5 hr; however, only 50% of galanin radiolabel dissociated from the receptors by excess galanin or guanosine 5'-O-3-thiotriphosphate even after 20 hr. In contrast, galanin binding in whole cells was completely reversible within 1 hr. Competition binding assays showed that galanin-like peptides bound with picomolar affinities in membranes and whole cells. These peptides behaved as full agonists as determined by the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophosphate production and the stimulation of guanosine 5'-O-(3-[35S]thiotriphosphate binding. The agonist profile of M40, a representative chimeric peptide, was found not to be the result of receptor reserve because receptor inactivation by partial alkylation experiments confirmed its full intrinsic efficacy under conditions of a ""zero"" reserve state. These observations suggest that the antagonist effects in vivo of M40, and perhaps other chimeric peptides, are not mediated via direct interactions with the galanin receptor 1 receptor.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,1998
15944009,Pharmacological and functional characterization of galanin-like peptide fragments as potent galanin receptor agonists.,"The hypothalamic galanin-like peptide (GALP) was isolated by its ability to activate galanin receptors. The mature porcine GALP is a 60-amino acid neuropeptide proteolytically processed from a 120-amino acid precursor protein. It contains a region identical to the N-terminal 13-amino acids of the neuropeptide galanin. Within the sequence of human GALP (1-60) a potential proteolytic cleavage site between two basic amino acids is present at position 33, which might lead to a shorter C-terminally amidated peptide. In addition, the first two amino acids could be potentially removed via the action of dipeptidase IV. Ligand binding assays using the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y transfected with the respective galanin receptors revealed that human GALP (1-60) displayed the highest affinity for the galanin receptor subtype GalR3 (IC50 = 10 nM) followed by GalR2 (IC50 = 28 nM) and GalR1 (IC50 = 77 nM). Ligand binding assays and functional studies showed that the human GALP (3-32) fragment was at least as potent as full length GALP (1-60). Other studies have shown that shorter fragments like human GALP (1-21) and GALP (22-60) were not effective on feeding responses in mice as compared to the full length peptide. Taken together these data suggest that the putative fragment GALP (3-32) might represent the strongest mediator of biological GALP activity. Furthermore it might be a useful tool to study the affinity of GALP to galanin receptors and to search for specific GALP receptors.",,
12603839,Pharmacological and immunohistochemical characterization of the APJ receptor and its endogenous ligand apelin.,"Apelin peptides have recently been identified to be the endogenous ligands for the G protein-coupled receptor APJ. However, little is known about the physiological roles of this ligand-receptor pairing. In the present study we investigated the pharmacology of several apelin analogues at the human recombinant APJ receptor using radioligand binding and functional assays. This has led to the identification of key residues in the apelin peptide required for functional potency and binding affinity through structure-activity studies. In particular, we have identified that replacement of leucine in position 5, or arginine in position 2 and 4 of the C-terminal apelin peptide, apelin-13, resulted in significant changes in pharmacology. We also investigated the detailed localization of pre-proapelin and APJ receptor mRNA in a wide range of human, rat and mouse tissues using quantitative RT-PCR, and carried out a detailed immunohistochemical study of the distribution of the APJ receptor in rat brain and spinal cord. Interestingly, the APJ receptor was not only co-localized in white matter with GFAP in the spinal cord, but was also clearly localized on neurones in the brain, suggesting that this receptor and its peptide may be involved in a wide range of biological process yet to be determined.",,
12070757,Pharmacological characterisation of [(pX)Phe4]nociceptin(1-13)amide analogues. 1. In vitro studies.,"Phe(4) in the nociceptin (NC) sequence has been identified as the most critical residue for receptor interaction. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacological activity of a series of NC(1-13)NH(2) analogues, in which the hydrogen atom in the para position of Phe(4) was substituted with F, NO(2), CN, Cl, Br, I, CH(3), OH or NH(2). In receptor binding studies, performed using CHO cells expressing the recombinant human NC receptor (CHO(hOP4)) and in rat cerebral cortex membranes, [(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2), [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2), and [(pCN)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) displayed higher affinity than NC(1-13)NH(2). The affinity of [(pCl)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) was essentially identical to that of NC(1-13)NH(2), while the remaining compounds displayed reduced affinity. In a series of functional assays (stimulation of GTPgammaS binding in CHO(hOP4)cells and rat cerebral cortex membranes and inhibition of cAMP accumulation in CHO(hOP4) cells), the para substituted analogues behaved as full agonists (with the exception of [(pOH)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) which acted as a partial agonist in the GTPgammaS binding assays) with the following rank order potency:[(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) and [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) were either inactive or displayed micromolar potencies in cAMP accumulation experiments performed on cells expressing classical opioid receptors. All compounds were full agonists in isolated tissues from various species (guinea pig ileum, mouse colon and mouse/rat vas deferens) with the exception of [(pOH)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) which displayed partial agonist/weak antagonist activities. The rank order of potency was similar to that found in the other assays. The effects of all analogues were not modified by naloxone. The selective OP(4) receptor antagonist [Nphe(1)]NC(1-13)NH(2), tested in all preparations against one or both of the highly potent derivatives [(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) and [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2), showed pA(2) values similar to those found against NC, the pA(2) in the GTPgammaS binding/rat cerebral cortex assay being much higher (ca. 7.5) than in the other functional assays (ca. 6). This study further supports the notion that Phe(4) of NC is the critical residue for receptor occupation and activation. Moreover, as part of this study, we have identified two novel, highly potent and selective agonists for the OP(4) receptor, [(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) and [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2).",,
9168941,Pharmacological characterization and tissue distribution of the human and rat GALR1 receptors.,"The diverse biological functions of galanin are mediated via membrane bound high-affinity receptors. In order to identify and characterize potential galanin receptor subtypes, we have examined the specific 125I-galanin binding to the CHP-212 human neuroblastoma cell line. The galanin receptors expressed in CHP-212 cells, like GALR1 have high affinity for galanin (Kd = 0.07 nM) and the potency for inhibition of 125I-galanin binding by galanin peptides parallels that of hGALR1 expressed in a stable CHO cell line. We confirmed that GALR1 is expressed in these cells by RT-PCR. We further determined the tissue expression patterns of hGALR1 which is expressed in a variety of human tissues at a very low level, with the highest levels seen in heart, small intestine and prostate. A species of approximately 70 kDa is recognized by antisera specific for hGALR1 by Western blot analysis and should allow future measurements of receptor protein expression.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1997
17095587,"Pharmacological characterization of a novel nonpeptide antagonist of the human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, NBI-42902.","Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by peptides that act at the GnRH receptor has found widespread use in clinical practice for the management of sex-steroid-dependent diseases (such as prostate cancer and endometriosis) and reproductive disorders. Efforts to develop orally available GnRH receptor antagonists have led to the discovery of a novel, potent nonpeptide antagonist, NBI-42902, that suppresses serum LH concentrations in postmenopausal women after oral administration. Here we report the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterization of this compound. NBI-42902 is a potent inhibitor of peptide radioligand binding to the human GnRH receptor (K(i) = 0.56 nm). Tritiated NBI-42902 binds with high affinity (K(d) = 0.19 nm) to a single class of binding sites and can be displaced by a range of peptide and nonpeptide GnRH receptor ligands. In vitro experiments demonstrate that NBI-42902 is a potent functional, competitive antagonist of GnRH stimulated IP accumulation, Ca(2+) flux, and ERK1/2 activation. It did not stimulate histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells. Finally, it is effective in lowering serum LH in castrated male macaques after oral administration. Overall, these data provide a benchmark of pharmacological characteristics required for a nonpeptide GnRH antagonist to effectively suppress gonadotropins in humans and suggest that NBI-42902 may have clinical utility as an oral agent for suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.",,
10602324,Pharmacological characterization of antagonists of the C5a receptor.,"1. Potent and highly selective small molecule antagonists have recently been developed by us for C5a receptors (C5aR) on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). In this study we compared a new cyclic antagonist, F-[OPdChaWR], with an acyclic derivative, MeFKPdChaWr, for their capacities to bind to C5aR on human PMN and human umbilical artery membranes. We also compared their inhibition of myeloperoxidase (MPO) secretion from human PMNs and their inhibition of human umbilical artery contraction induced by human recombinant C5a. 2. In both PMNs and umbilical artery, the cyclic and acyclic C5a antagonists displayed insurmountable antagonism against C5a. There were differences in selectivities for the C5aR with F-[OPdChaWR] (pKb 8.64+/-0.21) being 30 times more potent than MeFKPdChaWr (pKb 7.16+/-0.11, P<0.05) in PMNs, but of similar potency (pKb 8.19+/-0.38 vs pKb 8.28+/-0.29, respectively) in umbilical artery. This trend was also reflected in their relative binding affinities, both antagonists having similar affinities (-logIC50 values) for C5aR in umbilical artery membranes (F-[OPdChaWR], 7.00+/-0.46; MeFKPdChaWr, 7.23+/-0.17), whereas in PMN membranes the C5aR affinity of the cycle F-[OPdChaWR] (7.05+/-0. 06) was four times higher than that of acyclic MeFKPdChaWr (6.43+/-0. 24, P<0.05). 3. In summary, the results reveal that these antagonists are insurmountable in nature against C5a for C5aR on at least two human cell types, and the differences in relative receptor binding affinities and antagonistic potencies against C5a are consistent with differences in receptors within these cell types. The nature of these differences is yet to be elucidated.",British journal of pharmacology,1999
15761110,Pharmacological characterization of CXC chemokine receptor 3 ligands and a small molecule antagonist.,"The CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) is predominantly expressed on T helper type 1 (Th1) cells that are involved in inflammatory diseases. The three CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 are produced at sites of inflammation and elicit migration of pathological Th1 cells. Here, we are the first to characterize the pharmacological potencies and specificity of a CXCR3 antagonist, N-1R-[3-(4-ethoxy-phenyl)-4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-yl]-ethyl-N-pyridin-3-ylmethyl-2-(4-fluoro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-acetamide (NBI-74330), from the T487 small molecule series. NBI-74330 demonstrated potent inhibition of [(125)I]CXCL10 and [(125)I]CXCL11 specific binding (K(i) of 1.5 and 3.2 nM, respectively) and of functional responses mediated by CXCR3, such as ligand-induced guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding, calcium mobilization, and cellular chemotaxis (IC(50) of 7 to 18 nM). NBI-74330 was selective for CXCR3 because it showed no significant inhibition of chemotactic responses to other chemokines and did not inhibit radioligand binding to a panel of nonchemokine G-protein coupled receptors. There was a striking difference in potencies among the three CXCR3 ligands, with CXCL11 >> CXCL10 > CXCL9. A comparison of the rank order of K(i) values with the rank order of monocyte production levels of these three ligands revealed a precise inverse correlation, suggesting that the weaker receptor affinities of CXCL9 and CXCL10 were physiologically compensated for by an elevated expression, perhaps to maintain effectiveness of each ligand under physiological conditions.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2005
12242085,Pharmacological characterization of human NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptors expressed in CHO cells by using NPY Y(1) receptor antagonists.,"Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) belongs to an opioid-modulatory system including two precursors (pro-NPFF(A) and pro-NPFF(B)) and two G-protein coupled receptors (NPFF(1) and NPFF(2)). The pharmacological and functional profiles of human NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were compared by determining the affinity of several peptides derived from both NPFF precursors and by measuring their abilities to inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Each NPFF receptor recognizes peptides from both precursors with nanomolar affinities, however, with a slight preference of pro-NPFF(A) peptides for NPFF(2) receptors and of pro-NPFF(B) peptides for NPFF(1) receptors. BIBP3226 ((R)-N(2)-(diphenylacetyl)-N-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)-methyl]-argininamide) and BIBO3304 ((R)-N(2)-(diphenylacetyl)-N-[4-(aminocarbonylaminomethyl)-benzyl]-argininamide trifluoroacetate), two selective neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y(1) receptor antagonists, display relative high affinities for NPFF receptors and exhibit antagonist properties towards hNPFF(1) receptors. The structural determinants responsible for binding of these molecules to NPFF receptors were investigated and led to the synthesis of hNPFF(1) receptor antagonists with affinities from 40 to 80 nM. Our results demonstrate differences in pharmacological characteristics between NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptors and the feasibility of subtype-selective antagonists.",European journal of pharmacology,2002
11033437,Pharmacological characterization of receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) and the human calcitonin receptor.,"Receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) are a family of single transmembrane domain proteins shown to be important for the transport and ligand specificity of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor. In this report, we describe the analysis of pharmacological properties of the human calcitonin receptor (hCTR) coexpressed with different RAMPs with the use of the Xenopus laevis melanophore expression system. We show that coexpression of RAMP3 with human calcitonin receptor changed the relative potency of hCTR to human calcitonin (hCAL) and rat amylin. RAMP1 and RAMP2, in contrast, had little effect on the change of hCTR potency to hCAL or rat amylin. When coexpressed with RAMP3, hCTR reversed the relative potency by a 3.5-fold loss in sensitivity to hCAL and a 19-fold increase in sensitivity to rat amylin. AC66, an inverse agonist, produced apparent simple competitive antagonism of hCAL and rat amylin, as indicated by linear Schild regressions. The potency of AC66 was changed in the blockade of rat amylin but not hCAL responses with RAMP3 coexpression. The mean pK(B) for AC66 to hCAL was 9.4 +/- 0.3 without RAMP3 and 9.45 +/- 0.07 with RAMP3. For the antagonism of AC66 to rat amylin, the pK(B) was 9.25 +/- 0.15 without RAMP3 and 8.2 +/- 0.35 with RAMP3. The finding suggests that RAMP3 might modify the active states of calcitonin receptor in such a way as to create a new receptor phenotype that is ""amylin-like."" Irrespective of the physiological association of the new receptor species, the finding that a coexpressed membrane protein can completely change agonist and antagonist affinities for a receptor raises implications for screening in recombinant receptor systems.",Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods,1999
15367576,Pharmacological characterization of relaxin-3/INSL7 receptors GPCR135 and GPCR142 from different mammalian species.,"Relaxin-3 has recently been identified as a ligand for two structurally related G-protein-coupled receptors, human GPCR135 and GPCR142. This current study reports the characterization of mouse and rat GPCR135 as well as GPCR142 from mouse, monkey, cow, and pig at the molecular and pharmacological levels. Mouse and rat GPCR135 exhibit high homology (>85%) to the human GPCR135 and have very similar pharmacological properties to that of the human GPCR135. Human and mouse/rat relaxin-3 both bind to and activate mouse, rat, and human GPCR135 at high affinity with IC(50) or EC(50) values close to 0.5 nM. In contrast, the mouse GPCR142 is less well conserved (74% homology) with human GPCR142. The rat GPCR142 gene was found to be a pseudogene. We further cloned GPCR142 genes from monkey, cow, and pig and found that they are highly homologous (>84%) to human GPCR142. Pharmacological characterization of GPCR142 from different species demonstrated that relaxin-3 binds to GPCR142 from different species at high affinity (IC(50) < 5 nM). However, relaxin-3 does not stimulate a Ca(2+) response in cells coexpressing Galpha(16) and mouse GPCR142, whereas it does for cells expressing GPCR142 from other species tested. Our results suggest that GPCR142 may have a diminished role as a receptor for relaxin-3 in rodents, or perhaps GPCR142 functions as a receptor for another ligand in nonrodents. Boels and Schaller recently reported bradykinin as a ligand for GPCR142 (also known as GPR100). In this report, we demonstrate that bradykinin activates neither GPCR135 nor GPCR142, whereas relaxin-3 does.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2005
12381680,"Pharmacological characterization of the chemokine receptor, hCCR1 in a stable transfectant and differentiated HL-60 cells: antagonism of hCCR1 activation by MIP-1beta.","C-C chemokine receptor-1 (CCR1) has been implicated in mediating a variety of inflammatory conditions including multiple sclerosis and organ rejection. Although originally referred to as the MIP-1alpha/RANTES receptor, CCR1 is quite promiscuous and can be activated by numerous chemokines. We used radioligand binding and [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays in membranes from a cell line transfected to express CCR1 (Ba/F3-hCCR1) to characterize a panel of chemokines (HCC-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MIP-1delta, MPIF-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and RANTES) as CCR1 ligands. In this recombinant model, these chemokines displaced 125I-MIP-1alpha with a wide range of potencies and, with the exception of MCP-2, acted as full agonists in stimulating [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange. We then assessed the utility of HL-60 cells cultured with known differentiating agents (PMA, DMSO, dibutyryl-cAMP or retinoic acid) for investigating CCR1 pharmacology. In [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, membranes from cells cultured with retinoic acid (4-6 days) were the most responsive to activation by MIP-1alpha and MPIF-1. FACS analysis and comparative pharmacology confirmed that these activities were mediated by CCR1. Using [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, intracellular calcium flux and/or whole cell chemotaxis assays in HL-60(Rx) cells, we validated that MIP-1alpha was the most potent CCR1 ligand (MIP-1alpha>MPIF-1>RANTES>or=MIP-1beta) although the ligands differed in their efficacy as agonists. MPIF-1 was the more efficacious (MPIF-1>RANTES=MIP-1alpha>>MIP-1beta). 125I-MIP-1beta binding in Ba/F3-hCCR1 and HL-60(Rx) membranes was competitively displaced by MIP-1alpha, MPIF-1 and MIP-1beta. The binding K(i) for these chemokines with 125I-MIP-1beta were essentially identical in the two membrane systems. Lastly, MIP-1beta antagonized [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange, Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis in HL-60(Rx) cells in response to robust agonists such as MIP-1alpha, RANTES and MPIF-1. Based on our results, we propose that MIP-1beta could function as an endogenous inhibitor of CCR1 function.",British journal of pharmacology,2002
9884074,Pharmacological characterization of the human vasopressin receptor subtypes stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.,"Three subtypes of human (h) arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptors, hV1A, hV1B and hV2, were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and characterized by [3H]-AVP binding studies. In addition, the coupling of the expressed receptor protein to a variety of signal transduction pathways was investigated. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms for the specific binding of [3H]-AVP to membranes, prepared from CHO cells transfected with hV1A, hV1B and hV2 receptors, yielded an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.39, 0.25 and 1.21 nM and a maximum receptor density (Bmax) of 1580 fmol mg(-1) protein, 5230 fmol mg(-1) protein and 7020 fmol mg(-1) protein, respectively. Hill coefficients did not differ significantly from unity, suggesting binding to homogenous, non-interacting receptor populations. Pharmacological characterization of the transfected human AVP receptors was undertaken by measuring the relative ability of nonpeptide AVP receptor antagonists, YM087, OPC-21268, OPC-31260, SR 49059 and SR 121463A, to inhibit binding of [3H]-AVP. At hV1A receptors, the relative order of potency was SR49059>YM087>OPC-31260>SR 121463A> >OPC-21268 and at hV2 receptors, YM087=SR 121463A>OPC-31260>SR 49059> >OPC-21268. In contrast, the relative order of potency, at hV1B receptors, was SR 49059> >SR 121463A=YM087=OPC-31260=OPC-21268. In CHO cells expressing either hV1A or hV1B receptors, AVP caused a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with an EC50 value of 1.13 nM and 0.90 nM, respectively. In contrast, stimulation of CHO cells expressing hV2 receptors resulted in an accumulation of cyclic AMP with an EC50 value of 2.22 nM. The potency order of antagonists in inhibiting AVP-induced [Ca2+]i or cyclic AMP response was similar to that observed in radioligand binding assays. In conclusion, we have characterized the pharmacology of human cloned V1A, V1B and V2 receptors and used these to determine the affinity, selectivity and potency of nonpeptide AVP receptor antagonists. Thus they may prove to be a valuable tool in further examination of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of AVP.",,
9459574,"Pharmacological characterization of YM087, a potent, nonpeptide human vasopressin V1A and V2 receptor antagonist.","The effects of YM087 (4'-[(2-methyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydroimidazo[4,5-d] [1]benzazepin-6-yl)-carbonyl]-2-phenylbenzanilide monohydrochloride), a novel nonpeptide vasopressin (AVP) receptor antagonist, on [3H]AVP binding to human AVP receptors (V1A, V1B and V2) cloned and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells generated from monkey renal tissue were studied. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms for the specific binding of [3H]AVP to membranes, prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with human V1A, V1B and V2 receptors, yielded an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.67 nM, 0.28 nM and 2.14 nM and a maximum receptor density (Bmax) of 2180 fmol/mg protein, 369 fmol/mg protein and 2660 fmol/mg protein, respectively. YM087 showed high affinity for AVP V1A and V2 receptors with Ki values of 6.3 and 1.1 nM, respectively, but had no effect on [3H]AVP binding to AVP V1B receptors. In COS-1 cells expressing either AVP V1A or V1B receptors, AVP caused a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). YM087 inhibited the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in COS-1 cells expressing AVP V1A receptors in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 14.3 nM, but did not influence this increase in AVP V1B-receptor expressing cells. In contrast, stimulation of COS-1 cells expressing AVP V2 receptors resulted in an accumulation of cAMP. YM087 inhibited AVP-induced cAMP production in COS-1 cells expressing AVP V2 receptors in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 1.95 nM. In all assays used, YM087 was devoid of any agonistic activity. These results suggest that YM087 is a potent nonpeptide dual human AVP V1A and V2 receptor antagonist, and that YM087 will be a powerful tool in investigation of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of AVP.",,
15692146,Pharmacological discrimination of calcitonin receptor: receptor activity-modifying protein complexes.,"Calcitonin (CT) receptors dimerize with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) to create high-affinity amylin (AMY) receptors, but there is no reliable means of pharmacologically distinguishing these receptors. We used agonists and antagonists to define their pharmacology, expressing the CT(a) receptor alone or with RAMPs in COS-7 cells and measuring cAMP accumulation. Intermedin short, otherwise known as adrenomedullin 2, mirrored the action of alpha CGRP, being a weak agonist at CT(a), AMY(2a), and AMY(3a) receptors but considerably more potent at AMY(1a) receptors. Likewise, the linear calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) analogs (Cys(ACM)(2,7))h alpha CGRP and (Cys(Et)(2,7))h alpha CGRP were only effective at AMY(1a) receptors, but they were partial agonists. As previously observed in COS-7 cells, there was little induction of the AMY(2a) receptor phenotype; thus, AMY(2a) was not examined further in this study. The antagonist peptide salmon calcitonin(8-32) (sCT(8-32)) did not discriminate strongly between CT and AMY receptors; however, AC187 was a more effective antagonist of AMY responses at AMY receptors, and AC413 additionally showed modest selectivity for AMY(1a) over AMY(3a) receptors. CGRP(8-37) also demonstrated receptor-dependent effects. CGRP(8-37) more effectively antagonized AMY at AMY(1a) than AMY(3a) receptors, although it was only a weak antagonist of both, but it did not inhibit responses at the CT(a) receptor. Low CGRP(8-37) affinity and agonism by linear CGRP analogs at AMY(1a) are the classic signature of a CGRP2 receptor. Our data indicate that careful use of combinations of agonists and antagonists may allow pharmacological discrimination of CT(a), AMY(1a), and AMY(3a) receptors, providing a means to delineate the physiological significance of these receptors.",,
11786503,"Pharmacological profile of the novel mammalian tachykinin, hemokinin 1.","1. The effects of the novel mammalian tachykinin, hemokinin 1 (HEK-1), have been investigated by radioligand binding and functional in vitro and in vivo experiments. 2. Similar to SP (K(i)=0.13 nM), HEK-1 inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner and with high affinity [(3)H]-substance P (SP) binding to human NK(1) receptor (K(i)=0.175 nM) while its affinity for [(125)I]-neurokinin A (NKA) binding at human NK(2) receptor was markedly lower (K(i)=560 nM). 3. In isolated bioassays HEK-1 was a full agonist at tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptors. In the rat urinary bladder (RUB) HEK-1 was about 3 fold less potent than SP. In the rabbit pulmonary artery (RPA) HEK-1 and in the guinea-pig ileum (GPI), HEK-1 was about 500 fold less potent than NKA and NKB, respectively. 4. The responses to HEK-1 were antagonized by GR 82334 in RUB (pK(B)=5.6+/-0.07), by nepadutant in RPA (pK(B)=8.6+/-0.04) and by SR 142801 in GPI (pK(B)=9.0+/-0.2) with apparent affinities comparable to that measured against tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptor-selective agonists, respectively. 5. Intravenous HEK-1 produced dose-related decrease of blood pressure in anaesthetized guinea-pigs (ED(50)=0.1 nmol kg(-1)) and salivary secretion in anaesthetized rats (ED(50)=6 nmol kg(-1)) with potencies similar to that of SP. All these effects were blocked by the selective tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonist, SR 140333. 6. We conclude that HEK-1 is a full agonist at tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptors, possesses a remarkable selectivity for NK(1) as compared to NK(2) or NK(3) receptors and acts in vivo experiments with potency similar to that of SP.",British journal of pharmacology,2002
8242249,"Pharmacological profile of valsartan: a potent, orally active, nonpeptide antagonist of the angiotensin II AT1-receptor subtype.","1. The pharmacological profile of valsartan, (S)-N-valeryl-N-([2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]-methyl)-vali ne, a potent, highly selective, and orally active antagonist at the angiotensin II (AII) AT1-receptor, was studied in vitro and in vivo. 2. Valsartan competed with [125I]-AII at its specific binding sites in rat aortic smooth muscle cell membranes (AT1-receptor subtype) with a Ki of 2.38 nM, but was about 30,000 times less active in human myometrial membranes (AT2-receptor subtype). 3. In rabbit aortic rings incubated for 5 min with valsartan, at concentrations of 2, 20 and 200 nM, the concentration-response curve of AII was displaced to the right and the maximum response was reduced by 33%, 36% and 40%, respectively. Prolongation of the incubation time with valsartan to 1 h or 3 h, further reduced the maximum response by 48% or 59% (after 20 nM) and by 59% or 60% (after 200 nM) respectively. After 3 h incubation an apparent pKb value of 9.26 was calculated. Contractions induced by noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or potassium chloride were not affected by valsartan. No agonistic effects were observed in the rabbit aorta at concentrations of valsartan up to 2 microM. 4. In bovine adrenal glomerulosa, valsartan inhibited AII-stimulated aldosterone release without affecting the maximum response (pA2 8.4). 5. In the pithed rat, oral administration of valsartan (10 mg kg-1) shifted the AII-induced pressor response curves to the right, without affecting responses induced by the electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow or by noradrenaline. Animals treated with valsartan 24 h before pithing also showed significant inhibition of the response to AII. 6. In conscious, two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K1C), valsartan decreased blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner after single i.v. or oral administration. The respective ED30 values were 0.06 mg kg-1 (i.v.) and 1.4 mg kg-1 (p.o.). The antihypertensive effect lasted for at least 24 h after either route of administration. After repeated oral administration for 4 days (3 and 10 mg kg-1 daily), in 2K1C renal hypertensive rats, systolic blood pressure was consistently decreased, but heart rate was not significantly affected. 7. In conscious, normotensive, sodium-depleted marmosets, valsartan decreased mean arterial pressure, measured by telemetry, after oral doses of 1-30 mg kg-1. The hypotensive effect persisted up to 12 h after 3 and 10 mg kg-1 and up to 24 h after 30 mg kg-1. 8. In sodium-depleted marmosets, the hypotensive effect of valsartan lasted longer than that of losartan(DuP 753). In renal hypertensive rats, both agents had a similar duration (24 h), but a different onset of action (valsartan at 1 h, losartan between 2 h and 24 h).9. These results demonstrate that valsartan is a potent, specific, highly selective antagonist of AII at theAT1-receptor subtype and does not possess agonistic activity. Furthermore, it is an efficacious, orally active, blood pressure-lowering agent in conscious renal hypertensive rats and in conscious normotensive,sodium-depleted primates.",,
21729729,Pharmacology and selectivity of various natural and synthetic bombesin related peptide agonists for human and rat bombesin receptors differs.,"The mammalian bombesin (Bn)-receptor family [gastrin-releasing peptide-receptor (GRPR-receptor), neuromedin B-receptor (NMB receptor)], their natural ligands, GRP/NMB, as well as the related orphan receptor, BRS-3, are widely distributed, and frequently overexpressed by tumors. There is increased interest in agonists for this receptor family to explore their roles in physiological/pathophysiological processes, and for receptor-imaging/cytotoxicity in tumors. However, there is minimal data on human pharmacology of Bn receptor agonists and most results are based on nonhuman receptor studies, particular rodent-receptors, which with other receptors frequently differ from human-receptors. To address this issue we compared hNMB-/GRP-receptor affinities and potencies/efficacies of cell activation (assessing phospholipase C activity) for 24 putative Bn-agonists (12 natural, 12 synthetic) in four different cells with these receptors, containing native receptors or receptors expressed at physiological densities, and compared the results to native rat GRP-receptor containing cells (AR42J-cells) or rat NMB receptor cells (C6-glioblastoma cells). There were close correlations (r=0.92-99, p<0.0001) between their affinities/potencies for the two hGRP- or hNMB-receptor cells. Twelve analogs had high affinities (≤ 1 nM) for hGRP receptor with 15 selective for it (greatest=GRP, NMC), eight had high affinity/potencies for hNMB receptors and four were selective for it. Only synthetic Bn analogs containing β-alanine(11) had high affinity for hBRS-3, but also had high affinities/potencies for all GRP-/hNMB-receptor cells. There was no correlation between affinities for human GRP receptors and rat GRP receptors (r=0.131, p=0.54), but hNMB receptor results correlated with rat NMB receptor (r=0.71, p<0.0001). These results elucidate the human and rat GRP-receptor pharmacophore for agonists differs markedly, whereas they do not for NMB receptors, therefore potential GRP-receptor agonists for human studies (such as Bn receptor-imaging/cytotoxicity) must be assessed on human Bn receptors. The current study provides affinities/potencies on a large number of potential agonists that might be useful for human studies.",Peptides,2011

We report the biochemical, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic characterization in vitro and in vivo of this compound. Compound 1 competitively inhibits binding of [3H]oxytocin and the peptide antagonist 125I-ornithine vasotocin analog to human and rat oxytocin receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA or Chinese hamster ovary cells with nanomolar potency. Selectivity against vasopressin receptor subtypes is >6-fold for V1a and >350-fold for V2 and V1b. Compound 1 inhibits oxytocin-evoked intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (IC50 = 8 nM). Compound 1 has no intrinsic agonist activity at the oxytocin receptor. Oxytocininduced contraction of isolated rat uterine strips is blocked by compound 1 (pA2 = 7.82). In anesthetized nonpregnant rats, single administration of compound 1 by i.v. or oral routes causes dose-dependent inhibition of contractions elicited by repeated injections of oxytocin with ED50 = 3.5 mg/kg i.v. and 89 mg/kg p.o., respectively. Compound 1 significantly inhibits spontaneous uterine contractions in pregnant rats near term when administered intravenously or orally. We conclude that compound 1 is a potent, selective, and orally active nonpeptide oxytocin receptor antagonist, which is a suitable candidate for evaluation as a potential tocolytic agent for the management of preterm labor.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2003
1331689,Phospholipase C activation by neurotensin and neuromedin N in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the rat neurotensin receptor.,"The rat neurotensin receptor cDNA sequence was transfected in Chinese hamster ovary cells and cellular clones which stably express the corresponding protein were isolated and characterized. The Scatchard analysis of the specific binding of [3H]neurotensin indicated a Kd value of 0.45 +/- 0.08 nM and a Bmax value of 3.27 +/- 0.29 pmol/mg of protein. Displacement experiments using peptidic analogs of neurotensin and levocabastine confirmed that the transfected receptor exhibits the binding properties of the neurotensin receptor characterized in the rat brain. Neurotensin stimulated the phosphoinositides hydrolysis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and this effect was mimicked by neurotensin(8-13) and by neuromedin N. The stimulation of phosphoinositides hydrolysis was not inhibited by pertussis toxin. These results indicate that the transfected cells actively express the rat neurotensin receptor which is functionally coupled to phospholipase C through a pertussis toxin-insensitive GTP-binding protein, and that neuromedin N is able to induce the phosphoinositides turnover by interaction with the neurotensin receptor.",,
14559902,Phospholipid transfer protein interacts with and stabilizes ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 and enhances cholesterol efflux from cells.,"Phospholipid lipid transfer protein (PLTP) is ubiquitously expressed in animal tissues and plays multiple roles in lipoprotein metabolism, but the function of peripheral PLTP is still poorly understood. Here we show that one of its possible functions is to transport cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to lipoprotein particles by a process involving PLTP interactions with cellular ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). When ABCA1 was induced in murine macrophages or ABCA1-transfected baby hamster kidney cells, PLTP gained the ability to promote cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from cells. Although PLTP alone had lipid efflux activity, its maximum activity was observed in the presence of high density lipoprotein particles. Pulsechase studies showed that the interaction of PLTP with ABCA1-expressing cells played a role in promoting lipid efflux. Overexpression of ABCA1 dramatically increased binding of both PLTP and apoA-I to common sites on the cell surface. Both PLTP and apoA-I were covalently cross-linked to ABCA1, each protein blocked cross-linking of the other, and both PLTP and apoA-I stabilized ABCA1 protein. These results are consistent with PLTP and apoA-I binding to ABCA1 at the same or closely related sites. Thus, PLTP mimics apolipoproteins in removing cellular lipids by the ABCA1 pathway, except that PLTP acts more as an intermediary in the transfer of cellular lipids to lipoprotein particles.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
12377945,Phosphorylation-dependent interaction of osteopontin with its receptors regulates macrophage migration and activation.,"Neutrophil-independent macrophage responses are a prominent part of delayed-type immune and healing processes and depend on T cell-secreted cytokines. An important mediator in this setting is the phosphoprotein osteopontin, whose secretion by activated T cells confers resistance to infection by several intracellular pathogens through recruitment and activation of macrophages. Here, we analyze the structural basis of this activity following cleavage of the phosphoprotein by thrombin into two fragments. An interaction between the C-terminal domain of osteopontin and the receptor CD44 induces macrophage chemotaxis, and engagement of beta(3)-integrin receptors by a nonoverlapping N-terminal osteopontin domain induces cell spreading and subsequent activation. Serine phosphorylation of the osteopontin molecule on specific sites is required for functional interaction with integrin but not CD44 receptors. Thus, in addition to regulation of intracellular enzymes and substrates, phosphorylation also regulates the biological activity of secreted cytokines. These data, taken as a whole, indicate that the activities of distinct osteopontin domains are required to coordinate macrophage migration and activation and may bear on incompletely understood mechanisms of delayed-type hypersensitivity, wound healing, and granulomatous disease.",,
8662698,Physical association of Gi2alpha with interleukin-8 receptors.,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8), one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response, belongs to a family of chemokines that includes NAP-2 (neutrophil-activating peptide-2) and Gro-alpha and whose biological activities are directed to a great extent toward neutrophils. Two distinct receptors have been described with overlapping, but not identical, binding affinities for IL-8, NAP-2, and Gro-alpha. This study was designed to examine the intracellular pathways activated upon the occupation of each of the IL-8 receptors (IL-8R). The formation of a physical coupling between IL-8 receptors and the alpha-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins was tested in neutrophils by examining the presence of the former in anti-Galpha immune precipitates. The addition of IL-8 to a suspension of human neutrophils led to a time-dependent detection of IL-8 in anti-Gi2alpha (raised against amino acids 159-168 (LERIAQSDYI) of Gi2alpha) and anti-Gtalpha (raised against the COOH-terminal 10 amino acids (KENLKDCGLF) of Gtalpha), but not anti-Gq, immunoprecipitates. Similar results were obtained in human 293 cells stably transfected with IL-8RA or IL-8RB. The peptide derived from the COOH-terminal sequence of Gt inhibited the co-immunoprecipitation of IL-8R and Gi observed in response to the anti-Gtalpha and anti-Gi2alpha antibodies. On the other hand, the Gi2alpha peptide only inhibited the immunoprecipitation induced by the anti-Gi2alpha antibody. Peptides derived from Gi1alpha or Gi3alpha had no effect in this assay. The introduction of the anti-Gi2alpha or anti-Gtalpha antibodies or their neutralizing peptides, but not the Gi1alpha or Gi3alpha peptides, into 293 IL-8RA or 293 IL-8RB cells completely blocked the calcium responses obtained upon stimulation with IL-8. These results demonstrate that the occupation of either type of IL-8 receptor leads to a physical coupling to the alpha-subunit of Gi2. In addition, the use of the subunit-specific peptides identified two functionally important but distinct regions of Gialpha, one involved in receptor/Gialpha interaction (KENLKDCGLF) and the other mediating downstream signal transmission (LERIAQSDYI). Finally, the results of this study also validate the use of the transfected 293 cell line as a model for the study of the signal transduction pathway(s) initiated by IL-8.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
6268632,Physical characterization of the transferrin receptor in human placentae.,"The physical properties and binding characteristics of the solubilized transferrin receptor isolated from the placental brush-border membrane of a human trophoblast cell were investigated. The receptor protein was isolated from solubilized 125I-labeled membranes by immunoprecipitation with anti-human transferrin in the presence of saturating amounts of human transferrin. Gel filtration on acrylamide agarose (AcA-22) at 23 degrees C in the absence of transferrin indicates the transferrin receptor has a Stokes radius of 4.6 nm. In the presence of transferrin, the Stokes radius of the receptor shifts to 6.3 nm. Sucrose density centrifugation studies indicate that it has a sedimentation coefficient of 9.8 S in the absence of transferrin and 11.2 S in the presence of transferrin. The molecular weight for the transferrin free receptor is calculated to be 213,000. Upon incubation with transferrin, it increases to 364,000. This is consistent with the idea that the active form of the solubilized receptor is a dimer and the dimer is in turn capable of binding two transferrin molecules.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1981
11006133,"Physical interaction of Delta1, Jagged1, and Jagged2 with Notch1 and Notch3 receptors.","The Delta/Serrate/LAG-2 (DSL) domain-containing proteins, Delta1, Jagged1, and Jagged2, are considered to be ligands for Notch receptors. However, the physical interaction between the three DSL proteins and respective Notch receptors remained largely unknown. In this study, we investigated this issue through the targeting of Notch1 and Notch3 in two experimental systems using fusion proteins comprising their extracellular portions. Cell-binding assays showed that soluble forms of Notch1 and Notch3 proteins physically bound to the three DSL proteins on the cell surface. In solid-phase binding assays using immobilized soluble Notch1 and Notch3 proteins, it was revealed that each DSL protein directly bound to the soluble Notch proteins with different affinities. All interactions between the DSL proteins and soluble Notch proteins were dependent on Ca(2+). Taken together, these results suggest that Delta1, Jagged1, and Jagged2 are ligands for Notch1 and Notch3 receptors.",,
12842087,"Physiological levels of tumstatin, a fragment of collagen IV alpha3 chain, are generated by MMP-9 proteolysis and suppress angiogenesis via alphaV beta3 integrin.","We demonstrate a physiological role for tumstatin, a cleavage fragment of the alpha3 chain of type IV collagen (Col IValpha3), which is present in the circulation. Mice with a genetic deletion of Col IValpha3 show accelerated tumor growth associated with enhanced pathological angiogenesis, while angiogenesis associated with development and tissue repair are unaffected. Supplementing Col IValpha3-deficient mice with recombinant tumstatin to a normal physiological concentration abolishes the increased rate of tumor growth. The suppressive effects of tumstatin require alphaVbeta3 integrin expressed on pathological, but not on physiological, angiogenic blood vessels. Mice deficient in matrix metalloproteinase-9, which cleaves tumstatin efficiently from Col IValpha3, have decreased circulating tumstatin and accelerated growth of tumor. These results indicate that MMP-generated fragments of basement membrane collagen can have endogenous function as integrin-mediated suppressors of pathologic angiogenesis and tumor growth.",,
15655707,Physiology of GIP--a lesson from GIP receptor knockout mice.,"A much greater insulin response is observed after oral glucose load than after intravenous injection of glucose. The hormonal factor(s) implicated as transmitters of signals from the gut to pancreatic beta-cells was referred to incretin; gastric inhibitory polypeptide or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is identified as one of the incretins. GIP exerts its effects by binding to its specific receptor, the GIP receptor, which is expressed in various tissues including pancreatic islets, adipose tissue, and brain. However, the physiological role of GIP has been generally thought to stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells, and the other actions of GIP have received little attention. We have bred and characterized mice with a targeted mutation of the GIP receptor gene. From these studies, we now know that GIP not only mediates early insulin secretion by acting on pancreatic beta-cells, but also links overnutrition to obesity by acting on adipocytes.",,
11897681,Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptors mediating insulin secretion in rodent pancreatic islets are coupled to adenylate cyclase but not to PLC.,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a potentiator of glucose-induced insulin secretion. PACAP binds to a PACAP-specific receptor (PAC1) and to VPAC receptors (VPAC1 and VPAC2), which share high affinity for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). In the present study, the molecular expression of PACAP receptor isoforms and the signaling pathways involved in the insulin secretory effect of PACAP were investigated in isolated rat and mouse pancreatic islets. mRNA encoding PAC1-short, -hop, and -very short variants, as well as VPAC1 and VPAC2, were expressed in pancreatic islets. PACAP and VIP were equipotent in potentiating glucose-induced insulin release. Both peptides were also equipotent in increasing cAMP production, but PACAP was more efficient than VIP. Unlike carbachol, PACAP and VIP had no effect on inositol phosphate production. In the PAC1-deficient mouse, the insulinotropic effect of PACAP was reduced, and its differential effect on cAMP production was abolished, whereas the effects of VIP remained unchanged. These results clearly show that the insulinotropic effect of PACAP involved both VPAC and PAC1. The PAC1 variants expressed in rat and mouse pancreatic islets seem to be coupled to adenylate cyclase but not to PLC.",Endocrinology,2002
12045255,Pivotal role of the renin/prorenin receptor in angiotensin II production and cellular responses to renin.,"Renin is an aspartyl protease essential for the control of blood pressure and was long suspected to have cellular receptors. We report the expression cloning of the human renin receptor complementary DNA encoding a 350-amino acid protein with a single transmembrane domain and no homology with any known membrane protein. Transfected cells stably expressing the receptor showed renin- and prorenin-specific binding. The binding of renin induced a fourfold increase of the catalytic efficiency of angiotensinogen conversion to angiotensin I and induced an intracellular signal with phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine residues associated to an activation of MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2. High levels of the receptor mRNA are detected in the heart, brain, placenta, and lower levels in the kidney and liver. By confocal microscopy the receptor is localized in the mesangium of glomeruli and in the subendothelium of coronary and kidney artery, associated to smooth muscle cells and colocalized with renin. The renin receptor is the first described for an aspartyl protease. This discovery emphasizes the role of the cell surface in angiotensin II generation and opens new perspectives on the tissue renin-angiotensin system and on renin effects independent of angiotensin II.",The Journal of clinical investigation,2002
15247268,Plasmin-induced migration requires signaling through protease-activated receptor 1 and integrin alpha(9)beta(1).,"Plasmin is a major extracellular protease that elicits intracellular signals to mediate platelet aggregation, chemotaxis of peripheral blood monocytes, and release of arachidonate and leukotriene from several cell types in a G protein-dependent manner. Angiostatin, a fragment of plasmin(ogen), is a ligand and an antagonist for integrin alpha(9)beta(1). Here we report that plasmin specifically interacts with alpha(9)beta(1) and that plasmin induces of cells expressing migration recombinant alpha(9)beta(1) (alpha(9)-Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells). Migration was dependent on an interaction of the kringle domains of plasmin with alpha(9)beta(1) as well as the catalytic activity of plasmin. Angiostatin, representing the kringle domains of plasmin, alone did not induce the migration of alpha(9)-CHO cells, but simultaneous activation of the G protein-coupled protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 with an agonist peptide induced the migration on angiostatin, whereas PAR-2 or PAR-4 agonist peptides were without effect. Furthermore, a small chemical inhibitor of PAR-1 (RWJ 58259) and a palmitoylated PAR-1-blocking peptide inhibited plasmin-induced migration of alpha(9)-CHO cells. These results suggest that plasmin induces migration by kringle-mediated binding to alpha(9)beta(1) and simultaneous proteolytic activation of PAR-1.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2004
10871287,Plasmin-sensitive dibasic sequences in the third fibronectin-like domain of L1-cell adhesion molecule (CAM) facilitate homomultimerization and concomitant integrin recruitment.,"L1 is a multidomain transmembrane neural recognition molecule essential for neurohistogenesis. While moieties in the immunoglobulin-like domains of L1 have been implicated in both heterophilic and homophilic binding, the function of the fibronectin (FN)-like repeats remains largely unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that the third FN-like repeat of L1 (FN3) spontaneously homomultimerizes to form trimeric and higher order complexes. Remarkably, these complexes support direct RGD-independent interactions with several integrins, including alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(5)beta(1). A pep- tide derived from the putative C-C' loop of FN3 (GSQRKHSKRHIHKDHV(852)) also forms trimeric complexes and supports alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(5)beta(1) binding. Substitution of the dibasic RK(841) and KR(845) sequences within this peptide or the FN3 domain limited multimerization and abrogated integrin binding. Evidence is presented that the multimerization of, and integrin binding to, the FN3 domain is regulated both by conformational constraints imposed by other domains and by plasmin- mediated cleavage within the sequence RK( downward arrow)HSK( downward arrow)RH(846). The integrin alpha(9)beta(1), which also recognizes the FN3 domain, colocalizes with L1 in a manner restricted to sites of cell-cell contact. We propose that distal receptor ligation events at the cell-cell interface may induce a conformational change within the L1 ectodomain that culminates in receptor multimerization and integrin recruitment via interaction with the FN3 domain.",,
12902511,Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 supports IL-8-mediated neutrophil transendothelial migration by inhibition of the constitutive shedding of endothelial IL-8/heparan sulfate/syndecan-1 complexes.,"The endothelium is the primary barrier to leukocyte recruitment at sites of inflammation. Neutrophil recruitment is directed by transendothelial gradients of IL-8 that, in vivo, are bound to the endothelial cell surface. We have investigated the identity and function of the binding site(s) in an in vitro model of neutrophil transendothelial migration. In endothelial culture supernatants, IL-8 was detected in a trimolecular complex with heparan sulfate and syndecan-1. Constitutive shedding of IL-8 in this form was increased in the presence of a neutralizing Ab to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), indicating a role for endothelial plasminogen activator in the shedding of IL-8. Increased shedding of IL-8/heparan sulfate/syndecan-1 complexes was accompanied by inhibition of neutrophil transendothelial migration, and aprotinin, a potent plasmin inhibitor, reversed this inhibition. Platelets, added as an exogenous source of PAI-1, had no effect on shedding of the complexes or neutrophil migration. Our results indicate that IL-8 is immobilized on the endothelial cell surface through binding to syndecan-1 ectodomains, and that plasmin, generated by endothelial plasminogen activator, induces the shedding of this form of IL-8. PAI-1 appears to stabilize the chemoattractant form of IL-8 at the cell surface and may represent a therapeutic target for novel anti-inflammatory strategies.",,
2413022,Plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator bind to immobilized fibronectin.,"Fibronectin immobilized onto polystyrene surface was found to bind plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) but only slightly the urokinase type as determined using mono- and polyclonal antibodies against the activators. Of the defined fibronectin fragments tested, the Mr 120,000-140,000 fragment was found to bind both plasminogen and t-PA. Proteolytically modified plasminogen (Lys-plasminogen) bound considerably better than the native form (Glu-plasminogen). Experiments with 125I-plasminogen yielded Kd = 9.1 X 10(-8) M for the binding to immobilized fibronectin. The partially or completely inactive single-chain form of t-PA (pro-t-PA) bound considerably better than the activated two-chain form. Lysine at greater than 3 mM inhibited the binding of plasminogen. The interaction was independent of calcium ions. CaCl2 (greater than 0.5 mM) and NaCl (greater than 0.2 M) inhibited the binding of pro-t-PA and of t-PA. Fibronectin-bound t-PA retained its ability to activate plasminogen. The observed interactions may operate in directional proteolysis localizing plasminogen and plasminogen activator to degrade fibronectin-containing extracellular matrix including fibrin clots.",,
9395524,Platelet factor 4 binds to glycanated forms of thrombomodulin and to protein C. A potential mechanism for enhancing generation of activated protein C.,"Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is an abundant platelet alpha-granule heparin-binding protein. We have previously shown that PF4 accelerates up to 25-fold the proteolytic conversion of protein C to activated protein C by the thrombin.thrombomodulin complex by increasing its affinity for protein C 30-fold. This stimulatory effect requires presence of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain in protein C and is enhanced by the presence of a chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) domain on thrombomodulin. We hypothesized that cationic PF4 binds to both protein C and thrombomodulin through these anionic domains. Qualitative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of avidin extracts of solutions containing biotinylated PF4 and candidate ligands shows that PF4 binds to GAG+ but not GAG- forms of thrombomodulin and native but not Gla-domainless protein C. Quantitative analysis using the surface plasmon resonance-based BIAcoreTM biosensor system confirms the extremely high affinity of PF4 for heparin (KD = 4 nM) and shows that PF4 binds to GAG+ thrombomodulin with a KD of 31 nM and to protein C with a KD of 0.37 microM. In contrast, PF4 had no measurable interaction with GAG- thrombomodulin or Gla-domainless protein C. Western blot analysis of normal human plasma extracted with biotinylated PF4 demonstrates PF4 binding to protein C in a physiologic context. Thus, PF4 binds with relative specificity and high affinity to the GAG- domain of thrombomodulin and the Gla domain of protein C. These interactions may enhance the affinity of the thrombin.thrombomodulin complex for protein C and thereby promote the generation of activated protein C.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
11986215,"Platelet factor 4 binds to low-density lipoprotein receptors and disrupts the endocytic machinery, resulting in retention of low-density lipoprotein on the cell surface.","The influence of platelets on the cellular metabolism of atherogenic lipoproteins has not been characterized in detail. Therefore, we investigated the effect of platelet factor 4 (PF4), a cationic protein released in high concentration by activated platelets, on the uptake and degradation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) via the LDL receptor (LDL-R). LDL-R-dependent binding, internalization, and degradation of LDL by cultured cells were inhibited 50%, 80%, and 80%, respectively, on addition of PF4. PF4 bound specifically to the ligand-binding domain of recombinant soluble LDL-R (half-maximal binding 0.5 microg/mL PF4) and partially (approximately 50%) inhibited the binding of LDL. Inhibition of internalization and degradation by PF4 required the presence of cell-associated proteoglycans, primarily those rich in chondroitin sulfate. PF4 variants with impaired heparin binding lacked the capacity to inhibit LDL. PF4, soluble LDL-R, and LDL formed ternary complexes with cell-surface proteoglycans. PF4 induced the retention of LDL/LDL-R complexes on the surface of human fibroblasts in multimolecular clusters unassociated with coated pits, as assessed by immuno-electron microscopy. These studies demonstrate that PF4 inhibits the catabolism of LDL in vitro in part by competing for binding to LDL-R, by promoting interactions with cell-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and by disrupting the normal endocytic trafficking of LDL/LDL-R complexes. Retention of LDL on cell surfaces may facilitate proatherogenic modifications and support an expanded role for platelets in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",,
9558385,Platelet factor 4 modulates fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) activity and inhibits FGF-2 dimerization.,"Platelet factor 4 (PF-4) inhibits angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of inhibition is poorly understood. We have investigated the mechanism of inhibition by examining the interaction of PF-4 and the fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2)/fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) system. PF-4 inhibited the binding of FGF-2 to high-affinity and low-affinity binding sites in murine microvascular endothelial cells (LEII cells) and proliferation. Maximum inhibition of binding to endothelial FGF receptors was observed at PF-4 concentrations between 5 and 10 microg/mL (half maximum inhibition at 0.6 micro/mL), and proliferation was completely inhibited at 2 microg/mL. At this concentration, PF-4 reduced internalization of 125I-FGF-2 by threefold and delayed degradation. To gain insight into the mechanism of inhibition, we have analyzed the interaction of PF-4 with FGF-2/FGFR by using mutant heparan sulfate-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the FGFR-1 cDNA (CHOm-FGFR-1) and by examining the direct interaction with FGF-2. In the absence of heparin, PF-4 inhibited binding of 125I-FGF-2 to CHOm-FGFR-1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, although not completely. In the presence of heparin, PF-4 abolished totally the stimulatory effect of heparin. Furthermore, PF-4 complexed to FGF-2 and inhibited endogenous or heparin-induced FGF-2 dimerization. These results indicate that PF-4 interacts with FGF-2 by complex formation, inhibiting FGF-2 dimerization, binding to FGF receptors, and internalization. This mechanism most likely contributes to the antiangiogenic properties of PF-4.",Blood,1998
11024046,Platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha binds to thrombin anion-binding exosite II inducing allosteric changes in the activity of thrombin.,"The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex is a platelet surface receptor that binds thrombin as one of its ligands, although the biological significance of thrombin interaction remains unclear. In this study we have used several approaches to investigate the GPIb alpha-thrombin interaction in more detail and to study its effect on the thrombin-induced elaboration of fibrin. We found that both glycocalicin and the amino-terminal fragment of GPIb alpha reduced the release of fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen by about 50% by a noncompetitive allosteric mechanism. Similarly, GPIb alpha caused in thrombin an allosteric reduction in the rate of turnover of the small peptide substrate d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA. The K(d) for the glycocalicin-thrombin interaction was 1 microm at physiological ionic strength but was highly salt-dependent, decreasing to 0.19 microm at 100 mm NaCl (Gamma(salt) = -4.2). The salt dependence was characteristic of other thrombin ligands that bind to exosite II of this enzyme, and we confirmed this as the GPIb alpha-binding site on thrombin by using thrombin mutants and by competition binding studies. R68E or R70E mutations in exosite I of thrombin had little effect on its interaction with GPIb alpha. Both the allosteric inhibition of fibrinogen turnover caused by GPIb alpha binding to these mutants, and the K(d) values for their interactions with GPIb alpha were similar to those of wild-type thrombin. In contrast, R89E and K248E mutations in exosite II of thrombin markedly increased the K(d) values for the interactions of these thrombin mutants with GPIb alpha by 10- and 25-fold, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that low molecular weight heparin (which binds to thrombin exosite II) but not hirugen (residues 54-65 of hirudin, which binds to exosite I of thrombin) inhibited thrombin binding to GPIb alpha. These data demonstrate that GPIb alpha binds to thrombin exosite II and in so doing causes a conformational change in the active site of thrombin by an allosteric mechanism that alters the accessibility of both its natural substrate, fibrinogen, and the small peptidyl substrate d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
11854294,Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). Evidence for integrated co-receptor function betwenn LRP and the PDGF.,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) functions in the catabolism of numerous ligands including proteinases, proteinase inhibitor complexes, and lipoproteins. In the current study we provide evidence indicating an expanded role for LRP in modulating cellular signaling events. Our results show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB induces a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP cytoplasmic domain in a process dependent on PDGF receptor activation and c-Src family kinase activity. Other growth factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, were unable to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP. The basis for this selectivity may result from the ability of LRP to bind PDGFBB, because surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated that only PDGF, and not basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor-1, bound to purified LRP immobilized on a sensor chip. The use of LRP mini-receptor mutants as well as in vitro phosphorylation studies demonstrated that the tyrosine located within the second NPXY motif found in the LRP cytoplasmic domain is the primary site of tyrosine phosphorylation by Src and Src family kinases. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of LRPs cytoplasmic domain results in increased association of the adaptor protein Shc with LRP and that Shc recognizes the second NPXY motif within LRPs cytoplasmic domain. In the accompanying paper, Boucher et al. (Boucher, P., Liu, P. V., Gotthardt, M., Hiesberger, T., Anderson, R. G. W., and Herz, J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15507-15513) reveal that LRP is found in caveolae along with the PDGF receptor. Together, these studies suggest that LRP functions as a co-receptor that modulates signal transduction pathways initiated by the PDGF receptor.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
11297552,"Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C), a novel growth factor that binds to PDGF alpha and beta receptor.","We have characterized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) C, a novel growth factor belonging to the PDGF family. PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
11903042,Platelet-derived growth factor-BB-mediated glycosaminoglycan synthesis is transduced through Akt.,"Previously we have demonstrated that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K) signal-transduction pathway mediates platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis in fetal lung fibroblasts. In the present study we further investigated the signal-transduction pathway(s) that results in PDGF-BB-induced GAG synthesis. Over-expression of a soluble PDGF beta-receptor as well as a mutated form of the beta-receptor, unable to bind PI-3K, diminished GAG synthesis in fetal lung fibroblasts subsequent to PDGF-BB stimulation. The PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin blocked PDGF-BB-induced Akt activity as well as significantly diminishing PDGF-BB-mediated GAG synthesis. Expression of dominant-negative PI-3K also abrogated Akt activity and GAG synthesis. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative Akt abrogated endogenous Akt activity, Rab3D phosphorylation and GAG synthesis, whereas expression of constitutively activated Akt stimulated Rab3D phosphorylation and GAG synthesis in the absence of PDGF-BB. Over-expression of wild-type PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10) inhibited Akt activity and concomitantly attenuated GAG synthesis in fibroblasts stimulated with PDGF-BB. These data suggest that Akt is an integral protein involved in PDGF-BB-mediated GAG regulation in fetal lung fibroblasts.",,
11460491,Platelet-fibrinogen interactions.,"Binding of fibrinogen to GPIIb-IIIa on agonist-stimulated platelets results in platelet aggregation, presumably by crosslinking adjacent activated platelets. Although unactivated platelets express numerous copies of GPIIb-IIIa on their surface, spontaneous, and potentially deleterious, platelet aggregation is prevented by tightly regulating the fibrinogen binding activity of GPIIb-IIIa. Preliminary evidence suggests that it is the submembranous actin or actin-associated proteins that constrains GPIIb-IIIa in a low affinity state and that relief of this constraint by initiating actin filament turnover enables GPIIb-IIIa to bind fibrinogen. Two regions of the fibrinogen alpha chain that contain an RGD motif, as well as the carboxyl-terminus of the fibrinogen gamma chain, represent potential binding sites for GPIIb-IIIa in the fibrinogen molecule. However, ultrastructural studies using purified fibrinogen and GPIIb-IIIa, and studies using recombinant fibrinogen in which the RGD and relevant gamma chain motifs were mutated indicate that sequences located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the gamma chain mediates fibrinogen binding to GPIIb-IIIa. There is evidence that fibrinogen itself binds to regions in the amino terminal portions of both GPIIb and GPIIIa and that the sites interacting with the fibrinogen gamma chain and with RGD-containing peptides are spatially distinct. Nonetheless, there appears to be allosteric linkage between these sites, accounting for the ability of RGD-containing peptides to inhibit platelet aggregation and arterial thrombosis.",,

10706604,Pleiotrophin signals increased tyrosine phosphorylation of beta beta-catenin through inactivation of the intrinsic catalytic activity of the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta.,"Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a platelet-derived growth factor-inducible, 18-kDa heparin-binding cytokine that signals diverse phenotypes in normal and deregulated cellular growth and differentiation. To seek the mechanisms of PTN signaling, we studied the interactions of PTN with the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) beta/zeta in U373-MG cells. Our results suggest that PTN is a natural ligand for RPTP beta/zeta. PTN signals through ""ligand-dependent receptor inactivation"" of RPTP beta/zeta and disrupts its normal roles in the regulation of steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules. We have found that PTN binds to and functionally inactivates the catalytic activity of RPTP beta/zeta. We also have found that an active site-containing domain of RPTP beta/zeta both binds beta-catenin and functionally reduces its levels of tyrosine phosphorylation when added to lysates of pervanidate-treated cells. In contrast, an (inactivating) active-site mutant of RPTP beta/zeta also binds beta-catenin but fails to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin. Finally, in parallel to its ability to inactivate endogenous RPTP beta/zeta, PTN sharply increases tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin in PTN-treated cells. The results suggest that in unstimulated cells, RPTP beta/zeta is intrinsically active and functions as an important regulator in the reciprocal control of the steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation levels of beta-catenin by tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. The results also suggest that RPTP beta/zeta is a functional receptor for PTN; PTN signals through ligand-dependent receptor inactivation of RPTP beta/zeta to increase levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin to initiate downstream signaling. PTN is the first natural ligand identified for any of the RPTP family; its identification provides a unique tool to pursue the novel signaling pathway activated by PTN and the relationship of PTN signaling with other pathways regulating beta-catenin.",,
16715077,Plexin-A1 and its interaction with DAP12 in immune responses and bone homeostasis.,"Semaphorins and their receptors have diverse functions in axon guidance, organogenesis, vascularization and/or angiogenesis, oncogenesis and regulation of immune responses. The primary receptors for semaphorins are members of the plexin family. In particular, plexin-A1, together with ligand-binding neuropilins, transduces repulsive axon guidance signals for soluble class III semaphorins, whereas plexin-A1 has multiple functions in chick cardiogenesis as a receptor for the transmembrane semaphorin, Sema6D, independent of neuropilins. Additionally, plexin-A1 has been implicated in dendritic cell function in the immune system. However, the role of plexin-A1 in vivo, and the mechanisms underlying its pleiotropic functions, remain unclear. Here, we generated plexin-A1-deficient (plexin-A1(-/-)) mice and identified its important roles, not only in immune responses, but also in bone homeostasis. Furthermore, we show that plexin-A1 associates with the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (Trem-2), linking semaphorin-signalling to the immuno-receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing adaptor protein, DAP12. These findings reveal an unexpected role for plexin-A1 and present a novel signalling mechanism for exerting the pleiotropic functions of semaphorins.",Nature cell biology,2006
18327254,"Plexin-A2 and its ligand, Sema6A, control nucleus-centrosome coupling in migrating granule cells.","During their migration, cerebellar granule cells switch from a tangential to a radial mode of migration. We have previously demonstrated that this involves the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A. We show here that plexin-A2 is the receptor that controls Sema6A function in migrating granule cells. In plexin-A2-deficient (Plxna2(-/-)) mice, which were generated by homologous recombination, many granule cells remained in the molecular layer, as we saw in Sema6a mutants. A similar phenotype was observed in mutant mice that were generated by mutagenesis with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and had a single amino-acid substitution in the semaphorin domain of plexin-A2. We found that this mutation abolished the ability of Sema6A to bind to plexin-A2. Mouse chimera studies further suggested that plexin-A2 acts in a cell-autonomous manner. We also provide genetic evidence for a ligand-receptor relationship between Sema6A and plexin-A2 in this system. Using time-lapse video microscopy, we found that centrosome-nucleus coupling and coordinated motility were strongly perturbed in Sema6a(-/-) and Plxna2(-/-) granule cells. This suggests that semaphorin-plexin signaling modulates cell migration by controlling centrosome positioning.",,
15210733,Plexin-B1/RhoGEF-mediated RhoA activation involves the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB-2.,"Plexins are widely expressed transmembrane proteins that mediate the effects of semaphorins. The molecular mechanisms of plexin-mediated signal transduction are still rather unclear. Plexin-B1 has recently been shown to mediate activation of RhoA through a stable interaction with the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG. However, it is unclear how the activity of plexin-B1 and its downstream effectors is regulated by its ligand Sema4D. Here, we show that plexin-B family members stably associate with the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB-2. Binding of Sema4D to plexin-B1 stimulates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of ErbB-2, resulting in the phosphorylation of both plexin-B1 and ErbB-2. A dominant-negative form of ErbB-2 blocks Sema4D-induced RhoA activation as well as axonal growth cone collapse in primary hippocampal neurons. Our data indicate that ErbB-2 is an important component of the plexin-B receptor system and that ErbB-2-mediated phosphorylation of plexin-B1 is critically involved in Sema4D-induced RhoA activation, which underlies cellular phenomena downstream of plexin-B1, including axonal growth cone collapse.",The Journal of cell biology,2004
29100074,Plexin-B2 Mediates Physiologic and Pathologic Functions of Angiogenin.,"Angiogenin (ANG) is a secreted ribonuclease (RNase) with cell-type- and context-specific roles in growth, survival, and regeneration. Although these functions require receptor-mediated endocytosis and appropriate subcellular localization, the identity of the cell surface receptor remains undefined. Here, we show that plexin-B2 (PLXNB2) is the functional receptor for ANG in endothelial, cancer, neuronal, and normal hematopoietic and leukemic stem and progenitor cells. Mechanistically, PLXNB2 mediates intracellular RNA processing that contribute to cell growth, survival, and regenerative capabilities of ANG. Antibodies generated against the ANG-binding site on PLXNB2 restricts ANG activity in vitro and in vivo, resulting in inhibition of established xenograft tumors, ANG-induced neurogenesis and neuroprotection, levels of pro-self-renewal transcripts in hematopoietic and patient-derived leukemic stem and progenitor cells, and reduced progression of leukemia in vivo. PLXNB2 is therefore required for the physiological and pathological functions of ANG and has significant therapeutic potential in solid and hematopoietic cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.",,
15218527,Plexin-B3 is a functional receptor for semaphorin 5A.,"Semaphorins are a large family of molecular cues implicated in neural development and in a variety of functions outside the nervous system. Semaphorin 5A (Sema5A) is a transmembrane semaphorin, containing seven thrombospondin type-1 repeats, which was recently found to control axon guidance. Here we show that plexin-B3 is a high-affinity receptor specific for Sema5A. We further demonstrate that plexin-B3 activation by Sema5A mediates functional responses in plexin-B3-expressing cells (either fibroblasts, epithelial and primary endothelial cells). In addition, Sema5A can trigger the intracellular signalling of the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor receptor, Met, associated in a complex with plexin-B3. We thus conclude that Sema5A is able to elicit multiple functional responses through its receptor plexin-B3.",EMBO reports,2004
10520994,Plexin-neuropilin-1 complexes form functional semaphorin-3A receptors.,"Class 1 and 3 semaphorins repulse axons but bind to different cell surface proteins. We find that the two known semaphorin-binding proteins, plexin 1 (Plex 1) and neuropilin-1 (NP-1), form a stable complex. Plex 1 alone does not bind semaphorin-3A (Sema3A), but the NP-1/Plex 1 complex has a higher affinity for Sema3A than does NP-1 alone. While Sema3A binding to NP-1 does not alter nonneuronal cell morphology, Sema3A interaction with NP-1/Plex 1 complexes induces adherent cells to round up. Expression of a dominant-negative Plex 1 in sensory neurons blocks Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. Sema3A treatment leads to the redistribution of growth cone NP-1 and plexin into clusters. Thus, physiologic Sema3A receptors consist of NP-1/plexin complexes.",Cell,1999
15239958,PlexinD1 and semaphorin signaling are required in endothelial cells for cardiovascular development.,"The identification of new signaling pathways critical for cardiac morphogenesis will contribute to our understanding of congenital heart disease (CHD), which remains a leading cause of mortality in newborn children worldwide. Signals mediated by semaphorin ligands and plexin receptors contribute to the intricate patterning of axons in the central nervous system. Here, we describe a related signaling pathway involving secreted class 3 semaphorins, neuropilins, and a plexin receptor, PlexinD1, expressed by endothelial cells. Interruption of this pathway in mice results in CHD and vascular patterning defects. The type of CHD caused by inactivation of PlexinD1 has previously been attributed to abnormalities of neural crest. Here, we show that this form of CHD can be caused by cell-autonomous endothelial defects. Thus, molecular programs that mediate axon guidance in the central nervous system also function in endothelial cells to orchestrate critical aspects of cardiac morphogenesis.",,
10520995,"Plexins are a large family of receptors for transmembrane, secreted, and GPI-anchored semaphorins in vertebrates.","In Drosophila, plexin A is a functional receptor for semaphorin-1a. Here we show that the human plexin gene family comprises at least nine members in four subfamilies. Plexin-B1 is a receptor for the transmembrane semaphorin Sema4D (CD100), and plexin-C1 is a receptor for the GPI-anchored semaphorin Sema7A (Sema-K1). Secreted (class 3) semaphorins do not bind directly to plexins, but rather plexins associate with neuropilins, coreceptors for these semaphorins. Plexins are widely expressed: in neurons, the expression of a truncated plexin-A1 protein blocks axon repulsion by Sema3A. The cytoplasmic domain of plexins associates with a tyrosine kinase activity. Plexins may also act as ligands mediating repulsion in epithelial cells in vitro. We conclude that plexins are receptors for multiple (and perhaps all) classes of semaphorins, either alone or in combination with neuropilins, and trigger a novel signal transduction pathway controlling cell repulsion.",Cell,1999
10788520,Polyubiquitination of the epidermal growth factor receptor occurs at the plasma membrane upon ligand-induced activation.,"We have previously shown that, although overexpression of mutant dynamin inhibits clathrin-dependent endocytosis and disrupts high affinity binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the EGF receptor (EGFR), it does not inhibit ligand-induced translocation of the EGFR into clathrin-coated pits. In the present study, we demonstrate that, upon ligand binding and incubation at 37 degrees C, the EGFR was polyubiquitinated regardless of overexpression of mutant dynamin. In cells not overexpressing mutant dynamin, the EGFR was rapidly internalized and deubiquitinated. In cells being endocytosis-deficient, due to overexpression of mutant dynamin, however, the EGFR was upon prolonged chase first found in deeply invaginated coated pits, and then eventually moved out of the coated pits and back onto the smooth plasma membrane. Polyubiquitination occurred equally efficiently in cells with or without intact clathrin-dependent endocytosis, while the kinetics of ubiquitination and deubiquitination was somewhat different. We further found that the EGF-induced ubiquitination of Eps15 occurred both in the absence and presence of endocytosis with the same kinetics as polyubiquitination of the EGFR, but that the EGF-induced monoubiquitination of Eps15 was somewhat reduced upon overexpression of mutant dynamin. Our data show that EGF-induced polyubiquitination of the EGFR occurs at the plasma membrane.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
30477585,Pooled extracellular receptor-ligand interaction screening using CRISPR activation.,Extracellular interactions between cell surface receptors are necessary for signaling and adhesion but identifying them remains technically challenging. We describe a cell-based genome-wide approach employing CRISPR activation to identify receptors for a defined ligand. We show receptors for high-affinity antibodies and low-affinity ligands can be unambiguously identified when used in pools or as individual binding probes. We apply this technique to identify ligands for the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors and show that the Nogo myelin-associated inhibitory proteins are ligands for ADGRB1. This method will enable extracellular receptor-ligand identification on a genome-wide scale.,,

If a clonotypic T cell receptor expressed on a circulating T cell binds to the pMHC complex, the cell presenting the pMHC is killed. In this manner, some tumor cells expressing aberrant proteins are recognized and removed by the immune system. However, not all tumors are recognized efficiently. One reason hypothesized for poor T cell recognition of tumor-associated peptides is poor binding of those peptides to class I MHC molecules. Many peptides, derived from the proto-oncogene HER-2/neu have been shown to be recognized by cytotoxic T cells derived from HLA-A2(+) patients with breast cancer and other adenocarcinomas. Seven of these peptides were found to bind with intermediate to poor affinity. In particular, GP2 (HER-2/neu residues 654-662) binds very poorly even though it is predicted to bind well based upon the presence of the correct HLA-A2.1 peptide-binding motif. Altering the anchor residues to those most favored by HLA-A2.1 did not significantly improve binding affinity. The crystallographic structure shows that unlike other class I-peptide structures, the center of the peptide does not assume one specific conformation and does not make stabilizing contacts with the peptide-binding cleft.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
22353464,Possible roles of DLK1 in the Notch pathway during development and disease.,"The Delta-Notch pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway which controls a broad range of developmental processes including cell fate determination, terminal differentiation and proliferation. In mammals, four Notch receptors (NOTCH1-4) and five activating canonical ligands (JAGGED1, JAGGED2, DLL1, DLL3 and DLL4) have been described. The precise function of noncanonical Notch ligands remains unclear. Delta-like 1 homolog (DLK1), the best studied noncanonical Notch ligand, has been shown to act as an inhibitor of Notch signaling in vitro, but its function in vivo is poorly understood. In this review we summarize Notch signaling during development and highlight recent studies in DLK1expression that reveal new insights into its function.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,2012
8621728,Post-translational modifications of recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 required for binding to P- and E-selectin.,"P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a mucin-like ligand for P- and E-selectin on human leukocytes. PSGL-1 requires sialylated, fucosylated O-linked glycans and tyrosine sulfate to bind P-selectin. Less is known about the determinants that PSGL-1 requires to bind E-selectin. To further define the modifications required for PSGL-1 to bind P- and E-selectin, we transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with cDNAs for PSGL-1 and specific glycosyltransferases. CHO cells synthesize only core 1 O-linked glycans (Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha1-Se r/Thr); they lack core 2 O-linked glycans (Galbeta1-3(Galbeta1-4GlcNAcbeta1-6)GalNAcalpha1 -Ser/Thr) because they do not express the core 2 beta1 6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT). CHO cells also lack alpha1 3 fucosyltransferase activity. PSGL-1 expressed on transfected CHO cells bound P- and E-selectin only when it was co-expressed with both C2GnT and an alpha1 3 fucosyltransferase (Fuc-TIII, Fuc-TIV, or Fuc-TVII). Chromatography of beta-eliminated O-linked glycans from PSGL-1 co-expressed with C2GnT confirmed synthesis of core 2 structures. Tyrosine residues on PSGL-1 expressed in CHO cells were shown to be sulfated. Phenylalanine replacement of three tyrosines within a consensus sequence for tyrosine sulfation abolished binding to P-selectin but not to E-selectin. These results demonstrate that PSGL-1 requires core 2 O-linked glycans that are sialylated and fucosylated to bind P- and E-selectin. PSGL-1 also requires tyrosine sulfate to bind P-selectin but not E-selectin.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996

They have been characterised using specific peptidic and non-peptidic ligands with affinities differing by 1000 fold or more. These subtypes are present in adrenal glomerulosa of both species. Human uterus contains only subtype A, whereas both subtypes are found in rat uterus. Vascular smooth muscle cells in culture express only subtype B. Dithio-threitol totally inhibits binding to subtype B, but enhances the affinity to subtype A. There is a good correlation between the affinities of the selected agonists and antagonists for the two subtypes in the various tissues tested which is a usual requirement for receptor classification.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1989
12374741,Presenilins mediate a dual intramembranous gamma-secretase cleavage of Notch-1.,"Following ectodomain shedding, Notch-1 undergoes presenilin (PS)-dependent constitutive intramembranous endoproteolysis at site-3. This cleavage is similar to the PS-dependent gamma-secretase cleavage of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP). However, topological differences in cleavage resulting in amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) or the Notch-1 intracellular domain (NICD) indicated independent mechanisms of proteolytic cleavage. We now demonstrate the secretion of an N-terminal Notch-1 Abeta-like fragment (Nbeta). Analysis of Nbeta by MALDI-TOF MS revealed that Nbeta is cleaved at a novel site (site-4, S4) near the middle of the transmembrane domain. Like the corresponding cleavage of betaAPP at position 40 and 42 of the Abeta domain, S4 cleavage is PS dependent. The precision of this cleavage is affected by familial Alzheimer's disease-associated PS1 mutations similar to the pathological endoproteolysis of betaAPP. Considering these similarities between intramembranous processing of Notch and betaAPP, we conclude that these proteins are cleaved by a common mechanism utilizing the same protease, i.e. PS/gamma-secretase.",The EMBO journal,2002
21464395,Pressor and renal hemodynamic effects of the novel angiotensin A peptide are angiotensin II type 1A receptor dependent.,"Recently, a new derivative of angiotensin (Ang) II, called ""Ang A,"" has been discovered to be present in plasma of healthy humans and, in increased concentrations, in end-stage renal failure patients. The objectives of the study were to investigate the blood pressure and renal hemodynamic responses to Ang A in normotensive and hypertensive rats and in genetically modified mice and the binding properties of Ang A to Ang II type 1 (AT(1)) or Ang II type 2 (AT(2)) receptors. Intravenous and intrarenal administration of Ang A induced dose-dependent pressor and renal vasoconstrictor responses in normotensive rats, which were blocked by the AT(1) receptor antagonist candesartan but were not altered by the AT(2) receptor ligands PD123319, CGP42112A, or compound 21. Similar responses were observed after intravenous administration in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Deletion of AT(1a) receptors in mice almost completely abolished the pressor and renal vasoconstrictor responses to Ang A, indicating that its effects are mediated via AT(1a) receptors. Ang A was less potent than Ang II in vivo. The in vitro study demonstrated that Ang A is a full agonist for AT(1) receptors, with similar affinity for AT(1) and AT(2) receptors as Ang II. Overall, the responses to Ang A and Ang II were similar. Ang A has no physiological role to modulate the pressor and renal hemodynamic effects of Ang II.",,
8170987,Primary structure and functional expression of a guinea pig kappa opioid (dynorphin) receptor.,"A full-length cDNA encoding the guinea pig kappa opioid (dynorphin) receptor has been isolated. The deduced protein contains 380 aa and seven hydrophobic alpha-helices characteristic of the G protein-coupled receptors. This receptor is 90% identical to the mouse and rat kappa receptors, with the greatest level of divergence in the N-terminal region. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the receptor displays high affinity and stereospecificity toward dynorphin peptides and other kappa-selective opioid ligands such as U50, 488. It does not bind the mu- and delta-selective opioid ligands. The expressed receptor is functionally coupled to G protein(s) to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and Ca2+ channels. The guinea pig kappa receptor mRNA is expressed in many brain areas, including the cerebellum, a pattern that agrees well with autoradiographic maps of classical guinea pig kappa binding sites. Species differences in the pharmacology and mRNA distribution between the cloned guinea pig and rat kappa receptors may be worthy of further examination.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1994
10196234,Pro-adhesive and chemotactic activities of thrombospondin-1 for breast carcinoma cells are mediated by alpha3beta1 integrin and regulated by insulin-like growth factor-1 and CD98.,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a matricellular protein that displays both pro- and anti-adhesive activities. Binding to sulfated glycoconjugates mediates most high affinity binding of soluble TSP1 to MDA-MB-435 cells, but attachment and spreading of these cells on immobilized TSP1 is primarily beta1 integrin-dependent. The integrin alpha3beta1 is the major mediator of breast carcinoma cell adhesion and chemotaxis to TSP1. This integrin is partially active in MDA-MB-435 cells but is mostly inactive in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, which require beta1 integrin activation to induce spreading on TSP1. Integrin-mediated cell spreading on TSP1 is accompanied by extension of filopodia containing beta1 integrins. TSP1 binding activity of the alpha3beta1 integrin is not stimulated by CD47-binding peptides from TSP1 or by protein kinase C activation, which activate alphavbeta3 integrin function in the same cells. In MDA-MB-231 but not MDA-MB-435 cells, this integrin is activated by pertussis toxin, whereas serum, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and ligation of CD98 increase activity of this integrin in both cell lines. Serum stimulation is accompanied by increased surface expression of CD98, whereas insulin-like growth factor-1 does not increase CD98 expression. Thus, the pro-adhesive activity of TSP1 for breast carcinoma cells is controlled by several signals that regulate activity of the alpha3beta1 integrin.",,
11359786,Pro-collagenase-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1) binds the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin upon release from keratinocytes migrating on type I collagen.,"In injured skin, collagenase-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1)) is induced in migrating keratinocytes. This site-specific expression is regulated by binding of the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin with dermal type I collagen, and the catalytic activity of MMP-1 is required for keratinocyte migration. Because of this functional association among substrate/ligand, receptor, and proteinase, we assessed whether the integrin also directs the compartmentalization of MMP-1 to its matrix target. Indeed, pro-MMP-1 co-localized to sites of alpha(2)beta(1) contacts in migrating keratinocytes. Furthermore, pro-MMP-1 co-immunoprecipitated with alpha(2)beta(1) from keratinocytes, and alpha(2)beta(1) co-immunoprecipitated with pro-MMP-1. No other MMPs bound alpha(2)beta(1), and no other integrins interacted with MMP-1. Pro-MMP-1 also provided a substrate for alpha(2)beta(1)-dependent adhesion of platelets. Complex formation on keratinocytes was most efficient on native type I collagen and reduced or ablated on denatured or cleaved collagen. Competition studies suggested that the alpha(2) I domain interacts with the linker and hemopexin domains of pro-MMP-1, not with the pro-domain. These data indicate that the interaction of pro-MMP-1 with alpha(2)beta(1) confines this proteinase to points of cell contact with collagen and that the ternary complex of integrin, enzyme, and substrate function together to drive and regulate keratinocyte migration.",,

The MrgX2 receptor has been shown to be activated by the peptides cortistatin and proadrenomedullin N-terminal peptides (PAMP). Here we investigated the structure activity relationship of PAMP and identified key structural features that are shared with cortistatin and might explain why two apparently unrelated peptides are able to activate a single G protein-coupled receptor.,European journal of pharmacology,2005
12787023,Probing the interface between factor Xa and tissue factor in the quaternary complex tissue factor-factor VIIa-factor Xa-tissue factor pathway inhibitor.,"Blood coagulation is triggered by the formation of a complex between factor VIIa (FVIIa) and its cofactor, tissue factor (TF). TF-FVIIa is inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in two steps: first TFPI is bound to the active site of factor Xa (FXa), and subsequently FXa-TFPI exerts feedback inhibition of TF-FVIIa. The FXa-dependent inhibition of TF-FVIIa activity by TFPI leads to formation of the quaternary complex TF-FVIIa-FXa-TFPI. We used site-directed fluorescence probing to map part of the region of soluble TF (sTF) that interacts with FXa in sTF-FVIIa-FXa-TFPI. We found that the C-terminal region of sTF, including positions 163, 166, 200 and 201, is involved in binding to FXa in the complex, and FXa, most likely via its Gla domain, is also in contact with the Gla domain of FVIIa in this part of the binding region. Furthermore, a region that includes the N-terminal part of the TF2 domain and the C-terminal part of the TF1 domain, i.e. the residues 104 and 197, participates in the interaction with FXa in the quaternary complex. Moreover, comparisons of the interaction areas between sTF and FX(a) in the quaternary complex sTF-FVIIa-FXa-TFPI and in the ternary complexes sTF-FVII-FXa or sTF-FVIIa-FX demonstrated large similarities.",,
10736564,Production and characterization of the extracellular domain of recombinant human fibroblast growth factor receptor 4.,"Among the members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family the FGFR4 has demonstrated strong dependence on heparin-like material for its activation by fibroblast growth factors. We have produced and characterized a recombinant human FGFR4 extracellular domain (FGFR4ed), in order to study its biochemical properties in isolated conditions. The FGFR4ed was expressed in an insect cell system and purified from the culture medium by Ni(2+)-affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Pure FGFR4ed was tested for FGF- and heparin-binding by covalent crosslinking experiments and by biosensor analysis. In solution, FGFR4ed formed complexes with acidic FGF (FGF-1) and basic FGF (FGF-2), both in the presence and absence of heparin. Immobilized FGFR4 also bound FGF-8 besides FGF-1 and FGF-2. Furthermore, heparin alone induced receptor oligomerization on the surface of the receptor coupled chip. Thus, the recombinant FGFR4ed revealed properties described for the cellular form of this receptor and can be used for interaction studies.",,
11811984,Production of recombinant large proneurotensin/neuromedin N-derived peptides and characterization of their binding and biological activity.,"Proneurotensin/neuromedin N (pro-NT/NN) is the common precursor of two biologically active related peptides, neuromedin N (NN) and neurotensin (NT). It undergoes a tissue-specific processing leading to the formation in some tissues and cancer cell lines of large peptides ending with the NT (large NT) or NN (large NN) sequence. In this study, we prepared and purified high amounts of recombinant large NT and large NN using the Drosophila S2 cell expression system. The binding and pharmacological properties of recombinant large peptides were characterized and compared to those of NT and NN using either COS cells transfected with the human subtype-1 NT receptor (hNTS1) or the human colon adenocarcinoma HT29 cell line that endogenously expresses hNTS1. Furthermore, the metabolic stability of the large peptides, when exposed to HT29 cells, was compared to that of NT and NN. Both large NT and large NN were able to bind to and activate hNTS1 with potencies that were approximately 10 times lower than that of their small counterpart. In addition, the large forms proved to be far less sensitive to degradation than the small peptides. Taken together, these data suggest that the large forms might represent endogenous, long-lasting activators of hNTS1 in a number of physiopathological situations.",,
11850634,Proenkephalin A gene products activate a new family of sensory neuron--specific GPCRs.,"Several peptide fragments are produced by proteolytic cleavage of the opioid peptide precursor proenkephalin A, and among these are a number of enkephalin fragments, in particular bovine adrenal medulla peptide 22 (BAM22). These peptide products have been implicated in diverse biological functions, including analgesia. We have cloned a newly identified family of 'orphan' G protein--coupled receptors (GPCRs) and demonstrate that BAM22 and a number of its fragments bind to and activate these receptors with nanomolar affinities. This family of GPCRs is uniquely localized in the human and rat small sensory neuron, and we called this family the sensory neuron--specific G protein--coupled receptors (SNSRs). Receptors of the SNSR family are distinct from the traditional opioid receptors in their insensitivity to the classical opioid antagonist naloxone and poor activation by opioid ligands. The unique localization of SNSRs and their activation by proenkephalin A peptide fragments indicate a possible function for SNSRs in sensory neuron regulation and in the modulation of nociception.",Nature neuroscience,2002
17629517,Programmed death-1 ligand 1 interacts specifically with the B7-1 costimulatory molecule to inhibit T cell responses.,"Pathways in the B7:CD28 family of costimulatory molecules regulate T cell activation and tolerance. B7-dependent responses in Cd28(-/-)Ctla4(-/-) T cells together with reports of stimulatory and inhibitory functions for Programmed Death-1 Ligand 1 or 2 molecules (PD-L1 or PD-L2) have suggested additional receptors for these B7 family members. We show that B7-1 and PD-L1 interacted with affinity intermediate to that of B7-1:CD28 and B7-1:CTLA-4. The PD-L1:B7-1 interface overlapped with the B7-1:CTLA-4 and PD-L1:PD-1 (Programmed Death-1) interfaces. T cell activation and cytokine production were inhibited by the interaction of B7-1 with PD-L1. The responses of PD-1-deficient versus PD-1,B7-1 double-deficient T cells to PD-L1 and of CD28,CTLA-4 double-deficient versus CD28,CTLA-4,PD-L1 triple-deficient T cells to B7-1 demonstrated that PD-L1 and B7-1 interact specifically to inhibit T cell activation. Our findings point to a substantial bidirectional inhibitory interaction between B7-1 and PD-L1 and add an additional dimension to immunoregulatory functions of the B7:CD28 family.",,
25398877,"Proinflammatory secreted phospholipase A2 type IIA (sPLA-IIA) induces integrin activation through direct binding to a newly identified binding site (site 2) in integrins αvβ3, α4β1, and α5β1.","Integrins are activated by signaling from inside the cell (inside-out signaling) through global conformational changes of integrins. We recently discovered that fractalkine activates integrins in the absence of CX3CR1 through the direct binding of fractalkine to a ligand-binding site in the integrin headpiece (site 2) that is distinct from the classical RGD-binding site (site 1). We propose that fractalkine binding to the newly identified site 2 induces activation of site 1 though conformational changes (in an allosteric mechanism). We reasoned that site 2-mediated activation of integrins is not limited to fractalkine. Human secreted phospholipase A2 type IIA (sPLA2-IIA), a proinflammatory protein, binds to integrins αvβ3 and α4β1 (site 1), and this interaction initiates a signaling pathway that leads to cell proliferation and inflammation. Human sPLA2-IIA does not bind to M-type receptor very well. Here we describe that sPLA2-IIA directly activated purified soluble integrin αvβ3 and transmembrane αvβ3 on the cell surface. This activation did not require catalytic activity or M-type receptor. Docking simulation predicted that sPLA2-IIA binds to site 2 in the closed-headpiece of αvβ3. A peptide from site 2 of integrin β1 specifically bound to sPLA2-IIA and suppressed sPLA2-IIA-induced integrin activation. This suggests that sPLA2-IIA activates αvβ3 through binding to site 2. sPLA2-IIA also activated integrins α4β1 and α5β1 in a site 2-mediated manner. We recently identified small compounds that bind to sPLA2-IIA and suppress integrin-sPLA2-IIA interaction (e.g. compound 21 (Cmpd21)). Cmpd21 effectively suppressed sPLA2-IIA-induced integrin activation. These results define a novel mechanism of proinflammatory action of sPLA2-IIA through integrin activation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2015
12024206,Prokineticin 2 transmits the behavioural circadian rhythm of the suprachiasmatic nucleus.,"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controls the circadian rhythm of physiological and behavioural processes in mammals. Here we show that prokineticin 2 (PK2), a cysteine-rich secreted protein, functions as an output molecule from the SCN circadian clock. PK2 messenger RNA is rhythmically expressed in the SCN, and the phase of PK2 rhythm is responsive to light entrainment. Molecular and genetic studies have revealed that PK2 is a gene that is controlled by a circadian clock (clock-controlled). Receptor for PK2 (PKR2) is abundantly expressed in major target nuclei of the SCN output pathway. Inhibition of nocturnal locomotor activity in rats by intracerebroventricular delivery of recombinant PK2 during subjective night, when the endogenous PK2 mRNA level is low, further supports the hypothesis that PK2 is an output molecule that transmits behavioural circadian rhythm. The high expression of PKR2 mRNA within the SCN and the positive feedback of PK2 on its own transcription through activation of PKR2 suggest that PK2 may also function locally within the SCN to synchronize output.",,
9626554,"Prolactin (PRL) and its receptor: actions, signal transduction pathways and phenotypes observed in PRL receptor knockout mice.","PRL is an anterior pituitary hormone that, along with GH and PLs, forms a family of hormones that probably resulted from the duplication of an ancestral gene. The PRLR is also a member of a larger family, known as the cytokine class-1 receptor superfamily, which currently has more than 20 different members. PRLRs or binding sites are widely distributed throughout the body. In fact, it is difficult to find a tissue that does not express any PRLR mRNA or protein. In agreement with this wide distribution of receptors is the fact that now more than 300 separate actions of PRL have been reported in various vertebrates, including effects on water and salt balance, growth and development, endocrinology and metabolism, brain and behavior, reproduction, and immune regulation and protection. Clearly, a large proportion of these actions are directly or indirectly associated with the process of reproduction, including many behavioral effects. PRL is also becoming well known as an important regulator of immune function. A number of disease states, including the growth of different forms of cancer as well as various autoimmune diseases, appear to be related to an overproduction of PRL, which may act in an endocrine, autocrine, or paracrine manner, or via an increased sensitivity to the hormone. The first step in the mechanism of action of PRL is the binding to a cell surface receptor. The ligand binds in a two-step process in which site 1 on PRL binds to one receptor molecule, after which a second receptor molecule binds to site 2 on the hormone, forming a homodimer consisting of one molecule of PRL and two molecules of receptor. The PRLR contains no intrinsic tyrosine kinase cytoplasmic domain but associates with a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, JAK2. Dimerization of the receptor induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the JAK kinase followed by phosphorylation of the receptor. Other receptor-associated kinases of the Src family have also been shown to be activated by PRL. One major pathway of signaling involves phosphorylation of cytoplasmic State proteins, which themselves dimerize and translocate to nucleus and bind to specific promoter elements on PRL-responsive genes. In addition, the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway is also activated by PRL and may be involved in the proliferative effects of the hormone. Finally, a number of other potential mediators have been identified, including IRS-1, PI-3 kinase, SHP-2, PLC gamma, PKC, and intracellular Ca2+. The technique of gene targeting in mice has been used to develop the first experimental model in which the effect of the complete absence of any lactogen or PRL-mediated effects can be studied. Heterozygous (+/-) females show almost complete failure to lactate after the first, but not subsequent, pregnancies. Homozygous (-/-) females are infertile due to multiple reproductive abnormalities, including ovulation of premeiotic oocytes, reduced fertilization of oocytes, reduced preimplantation oocyte development, lack of embryo implantation, and the absence of pseudopregnancy. Twenty per cent of the homozygous males showed delayed fertility. Other phenotypes, including effects on the immune system and bone, are currently being examined. It is clear that there are multiple actions associated with PRL. It will be important to correlate known effects with local production of PRL to differentiate classic endocrine from autocrine/paracrine effects. The fact that extrapituitary PRL can, under some circumstances, compensate for pituitary PRL raises the interesting possibility that there may be effects of PRL other than those originally observed in hypophysectomized rats. The PRLR knockout mouse model should be an interesting system by which to look for effects activated only by PRL or other lactogenic hormones. On the other hand, many of the effects reported in this review may be shared with other hormones, cytokines, or growth factors and thus will be more difficult to study. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",,
11356126,Prolactin receptor heterogeneity: processing and signalling of the long and short isoforms during development.,"During development, the fetus is exposed to prolactin activity from the placenta, as well as from the developing fetal pituitary. Distinct prolactin receptor isoforms, having different cytoplasmic domains generated by alternative splicing, are expressed as development proceeds at different levels in different organs. The ""long"" receptors are able to mediate transduction of all signals examined, in contrast with the ""short"" isoforms, whose truncated cytoplasmic domains are able to mediate a much smaller repertoire of signals and can act as dominant negatives. Our studies demonstrate that, although these forms share internalization mechanisms, the long form is internalized faster, resulting in more rapid down-regulation of this form. In order to examine the mechanisms by which prolactin may exert trophic effects on its target tissues during development, we have examined the signalling pathways through which prolactin binding to the long receptor regulates the transcription of cyclin D1. Our studies reveal the importance of the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transduction and activators of transcription) pathway, and the complexity of prolactin signalling to this promoter.",,
12606605,Prolactin releasing peptide has high affinity and efficacy at neuropeptide FF2 receptors.,"Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) and prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) are two members of the RFamide peptide family. In this study we investigated whether these RFamide peptides, which have common structural features in their C-terminal RFamide motif and share several physiologically important functions, could exert their effects through the same set of receptors. The affinity and functional activity of several related RFamide peptides were determined at the human neuropeptide FF receptor subtype 2 (hNPFF2) and the human prolactin-releasing peptide (hPrRP) receptors. The full-length human prolactin releasing peptide 31 (hPrRP31) had significantly higher efficacy compared with NPFF and its stable analog, (1DMe)Y8Fa, at the hNPFF2 receptor. In contrast, NPFF and (1DMe)Y8Fa were not efficacious at the hPrRP receptor. Our study indicated a generally relatively low level of discrimination for RFamide peptides at the NPFF receptor, whereas the hPrRP receptor clearly preferred PrRP or very closely related peptides. The seemingly promiscuous binding of the RFamide peptides to the NPFF receptor was further confirmed by receptor autoradiography. PrRP may thus signal through the NPFF receptors in vivo.",,
22021614,Proliferating cell nuclear antigen is a novel inhibitory ligand for the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp44.,"NK cells play an important role in the early immune response to cancer. The NKp44 activating receptor is the only natural cytotoxicity receptor that is expressed exclusively by primate NK cells, yet its cellular ligands remain largely unknown. Proliferating cell nuclear Ag (PCNA) is overexpressed in cancer cells. In this study, we show that the NKp44 receptor recognizes PCNA. Their interaction inhibits NK cell function through NKp44/ITIM. The physical interaction of NKp44 and PCNA is enabled by recruitment of target cell PCNA to the NK immunological synapse. We demonstrate that PCNA promotes cancer survival by immune evasion through inhibition of NKp44-mediated NK cell attack.",,
12011057,"Prominent role of the Ig-like V domain in trans-interactions of nectins. Nectin3 and nectin 4 bind to the predicted C-C'-C""-D beta-strands of the nectin1 V domain.","Nectins form a family of integral molecules that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Their ectodomain is made of three Ig-like domains (V, C, C). This family comprises at least five members, namely nectin1, -2, -3, -4, and poliovirus receptor (PVR), that are involved in different physiological and pathological processes. (i) Nectins are adhesion molecules localized at adherens junctions in epithelial cells. (ii) Some nectins act as poliovirus or alpha-herpesvirus receptors (nectin1). (iii) Nectin1 mutations are involved in orofacial developmental abnormalities in humans. Adhesion properties of nectins are mediated by Ca(2+)-independent homophilic and heterophilic processes through ectodomain trans-interactions. We have described a nectin trans-hetero-interaction network: nectin3 binds to nectin1, nectin2, and PVR; nectin1 also binds to nectin4. In the present study we compared the affinities of the different trans-interactions mediated by nectin1. We found that the K(D) of nectin1/nectin3 and nectin1/nectin4 interactions is 1 and 100 nm, respectively, whereas the K(D) of the nectin1-mediated homophilic interaction is 1 microm. We show that nectin1/nectin3 and nectin1/nectin4 trans-hetero-interactions were mediated through trans V to V domain interactions, whereas C domains contributed to increase the affinity of the interaction. Nectin3 and nectin4 share a common binding region in the nectin1 V domain: (i) nectin3 strongly competed with nectin4 binding, (ii) nectin3 and nectin4 binding to nectin1 was reduced by a number of monoclonal antibodies directed against the nectin1 V domain, and (iii) the glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus-1 that binds to the V domain of nectin1 reduced nectin3 and nectin4 binding. Finally, using chimeric nectin1/PVR receptors where PVR V domain beta-strands were substituted with the corresponding regions of nectin1, the nectin3 and nectin4 minimal binding region on nectin1 V domain was mapped to the C-C'-C""-D beta-strands.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002

Mechanisms that regulate the appropriate timing of cell cycle withdrawal of these neuronal progenitors during brain development are not well defined. The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) is highly expressed in the proliferating GCPs, but is downregulated once the cells leave the cell cycle. This receptor has primarily been characterized as a death receptor for its ability to induce neuronal apoptosis following injury. Here we demonstrate a novel function for p75(NTR) in regulating proper cell cycle exit of neuronal progenitors in the developing rat and mouse EGL, which is stimulated by proNT3. In the absence of p75(NTR), GCPs continue to proliferate beyond their normal period, resulting in a larger cerebellum that persists into adulthood, with consequent motor deficits.",eLife,2016
12672054,Prostaglandin D2 inhibits the production of interleukin-12 in murine dendritic cells through multiple signaling pathways.,"Prostaglandin (PG) D(2), and its metabolites, are known to be important mediators during acute and chronic inflammation. However, their functions during the early phases of the immune response are poorly documented. In the present study, we show that PGD(2 )inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, the CD40- and LPS-induced secretion of the Th1-driving factor IL-12 by murine splenic dendritic cells (DC), the most potent antigen-presenting cells. The inhibition of IL-12 production is mediated only in part by the cell surface G alpha s protein-coupled D prostanoid receptor (termed DP1) but not by the G alpha i protein-coupled DP receptor, DP2. We show that recruitment of DP1 in DC results in the activation of a cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway that is partially responsible for the inhibition of IL-12 production. We also suggest that the DP1-independent effects exerted by PGD(2) on IL-12 production may be due to the action of ist PGJ(2), but not PGF(2)alpha, metabolites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that PGD(2) affects NF-kappa B activation through (the) DP1-independent pathway(s). Together these data suggest that PGD(2), by interacting with DP1 and by binding to other target cellular proteins, may regulate immune responses by affecting IL-12 production in DC.",European journal of immunology,2003
11208866,"Prostaglandin D2 selectively induces chemotaxis in T helper type 2 cells, eosinophils, and basophils via seven-transmembrane receptor CRTH2.","Prostaglandin (PG)D2, which has long been implicated in allergic diseases, is currently considered to elicit its biological actions through the DP receptor (DP). Involvement of DP in the formation of allergic asthma was recently demonstrated with DP-deficient mice. However, proinflammatory functions of PGD2 cannot be explained by DP alone. We show here that a seven-transmembrane receptor, CRTH2, which is preferentially expressed in T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, eosinophils, and basophils in humans, serves as the novel receptor for PGD2. In response to PGD2, CRTH2 induces intracellular Ca2+mobilization and chemotaxis in Th2 cells in a Galphai-dependent manner. In addition, CRTH2, but not DP, mediates PGD2-dependent cell migration of blood eosinophils and basophils. Thus, PGD2 is likely involved in multiple aspects of allergic inflammation through its dual receptor systems, DP and CRTH2.",,
11748263,Proteasomal regulation of betac signaling reveals a novel mechanism for cytokine receptor heterotypic desensitization.,"IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF are hematopoietic cytokines that are key mediators of the allergic inflammatory response. The receptors for these three cytokines consist of a cytokine-specific alpha (Ralpha) chain and a shared common beta (betac) chain. Herein, we demonstrate that agonistic ligation of these receptor subunits rapidly induces proteasomal degradation of the betac, but not the Ralpha, cytoplasmic domain, resulting in termination of signal transduction and yielding a truncated betac isoform ligated to the Ralpha subunit. Proteasomal degradation of the betac cytoplasmic domain was also a prerequisite for endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the ligated receptor subunits. Moreover, proteasome-dependent termination of signaling induced by one betac-engaging cytokine resulted in cellular desensitization to signal transduction by subsequent stimulation with another betac-engaging cytokine. These data provide the first evidence for ligand-dependent proteasomal degradation of the betac cytoplasmic domain, and they establish a novel mechanism for heterotypic desensitization of shared cytokine receptor signaling.",The Journal of clinical investigation,2001
16814777,Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z is inactivated by ligand-induced oligomerization.,"Receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are considered to transduce extracellular signals across the membrane through changes in their PTP activity, however, our understanding of the regulatory mechanism is still limited. Here, we show that pleiotrophin (PTN), a natural ligand for protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (Ptprz) (also called PTPzeta/RPTPbeta), inactivates Ptprz through oligomerization and increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates for Ptprz, G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactor 1 (Git1) and membrane associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain containing 1 (Magi1). Oligomerization of Ptprz by an artificial dimerizer or polyclonal antibodies against its extracellular region also leads to inactivation, indicating that Ptprz is active in the monomeric form and inactivated by ligand-induced oligomerization.",,
11356985,Proteinase-activated receptors.,"Proteinase-activated receptors are a recently described, novel family of seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors. Rather then being stimulated through ligand receptor occupancy, activation is initiated by cleavage of the N terminus of the receptor by a serine protease resulting in the generation of a new tethered ligand that interacts with the receptor within extracellular loop-2. To date, four proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) have been identified, with distinct N-terminal cleavage sites and tethered ligand pharmacology. In addition to the progress in the generation of PAR-1 antagonists, we describe the role of thrombin in such processes as wound healing and the evidence implicating PAR-1 in vascular disorders and cancer. We also identify advances in the understanding of PAR-1-mediated intracellular signaling and receptor desensitization. The cellular functions, signaling events, and desensitization processes involved in PAR-2 activation are also assessed. However, other major aspects of PAR-2 are highlighted, in particular the ability of several serine protease enzymes, in addition to trypsin, to function as activators of PAR-2. The likely physiological and pathophysiological roles for PAR-2 in skin, intestine, blood vessels, and the peripheral nervous system are considered in the context of PAR-2 activation by multiple serine proteases. The recent discovery of PAR-3 and PAR-4 as additional thrombin-sensitive PARs further highlights the complexity in assessing the effects of thrombin in several different systems, an issue that remains to be fully addressed. These discoveries have also highlighted possible PAR-PAR interactions at both functional and molecular levels. The future identification of other PARs and their modes of activation are an important future direction for this expanding field of study.",,
15188402,Proteins associated with type II bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR-II) and identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry.,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are polypeptide growth factors that regulate cell differentiation and proliferation. BMPs bind to type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors to initiate intracellular signalling. BMPR-II is the type II receptor, its mutations lead to hereditary pulmonary hypertension, and knockout of Bmpr-II results in early embryonic lethality. To identify novel interacting proteins and explore signalling pathways that can be initiated by BMPR-II, we performed glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays with BMPR-II protein constructs fused to GST and extracts of mouse myoblast C2C12 cells. We generated three constructs which contain different parts of the cytoplasmic region of BMPR-II: full-length cytoplasmic part of BMPR-II, only the kinase domain, or only the C-terminal tail of BMPR-II. Proteins which formed complexes with these BMPR-II constructs were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D GE), and specifically interacting proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). We identified 33 interacting proteins; 11 proteins interacted with the C-terminal tail of BMPR-II, 4 with full-length BMPR-II, and 18 with a short form of the receptor with a deleted tail. Fourteen proteins have assigned functions in various signalling processes, suggesting links of BMP signalling to regulation of MAP kinase pathway, apoptosis, transcription, PKCss, and PKA. Five of the identified proteins are components of the cytoskeleton, and four are enzymes involved in metabolism, e.g., processing of estrogens or lipids. We confirmed interaction of PKC beta and CtBP with BMPR-II using immunodetection. We showed that the C-terminal tail of BMPR-II provides binding sites for a number of regulatory proteins that may initiate Smad-independent signalling.",,
11015614,Proteoglycans in the developing brain: new conceptual insights for old proteins.,"Proteoglycans are a heterogeneous class of proteins bearing sulfated glycosaminoglycans. Some of the proteoglycans have distinct core protein structures, and others display similarities and thus may be grouped into families such as the syndecans, the glypicans, or the hyalectans (or lecticans). Proteoglycans can be found in almost all tissues being present in the extracellular matrix, on cellular surfaces, or in intracellular granules. In recent years, brain proteoglycans have attracted growing interest due to their highly regulated spatiotemporal expression during nervous system development and maturation. There is increasing evidence that different proteoglycans act as regulators of cell migration, axonal pathfinding, synaptogenesis, and structural plasticity. This review summarizes the most recent data on structures and functions of brain proteoglycans and focuses on new physiological concepts for their potential roles in the developing central nervous system.",Physiological reviews,2000
10978167,Proteolysis of the exodomain of recombinant protease-activated receptors: prediction of receptor activation or inactivation by MALDI mass spectrometry.,"Protease-activated receptors (PARs) mediate cell activation after proteolytic cleavage of their extracellular amino terminus. Thrombin selectively cleaves PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 to induce activation of platelets and vascular cells, while PAR2 is preferentially cleaved by trypsin. In pathological situations, other proteolytic enzymes may be generated in the circulation and could modify the responses of PARs by cleaving their extracellular domains. To assess the ability of such proteases to activate or inactivate PARs, we designed a strategy for locating cleavage sites on the exofacial NH(2)-terminal fragments of the receptors. The first extracellular segments of PAR1 (PAR1E) and PAR2 (PAR2E) expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli were incubated with a series of proteases likely to be encountered in the circulation during thrombosis or inflammation. Kinetic and dose-response studies were performed, and the cleavage products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Thrombin cleaved PAR1E at the Arg41-Ser42 activation site at concentrations known to induce cellular activation, supporting a native conformation of the recombinant polypeptide. Plasmin, calpain and leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3 cleaved at multiple sites and would be expected to disable PAR1 by cleaving COOH-terminal to the activation site. Cleavage specificities were further confirmed using activation site defective PAR1E S42P mutant polypeptides. Surface plasmon resonance studies on immobilized PAR1E or PAR1E S42P were consistent with cleavage results obtained in solution and allowed us to determine affinities of PAR1E-thrombin binding. FACS analyses of intact platelets confirmed the cleavage of PAR1 downstream of the Arg41-Ser42 site. Mass spectrometry studies of PAR2E predicted activation of PAR2 by trypsin through cleavage at the Arg36-Ser37 site, no effect of thrombin, and inactivation of the receptor by plasmin, calpain and leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3. The inhibitory effect of elastase was confirmed on native PAR1 and PAR2 on the basis of Ca(2+) signaling studies in endothelial cells. It was concluded that none of the main proteases generated during fibrinolysis or inflammation appears to be able to signal through PAR1 or PAR2. This strategy provides results which can be extended to the native receptor to predict its activation or inactivation, and it could likewise be used to study other PARs or protease-dependent processes.",,
10438732,Proteolytic processing of big endothelin-3 by the kell blood group protein.,"Kell blood group protein shares a consensus sequence (H.E.X.X.H) with a large family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases. Kell has closest homology with neutral endopeptidase 24.11, endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), and the PEX gene product that, as a group, comprise the M13 subfamily of mammalian neutral endopeptidases. The proteolytic activity of the M13 members, but not of Kell, has been previously demonstrated. A secreted form of wild-type Kell protein (s-Kell), devoid of the intracellular and transmembrane domains, was expressed in sf9 cells. As a negative control, an inactive mutant Kell protein (E582G) was expressed. As determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry of the cleaved products, wild-type s-Kell, but not the control mutant protein, specifically cleaved big endothelin-3 (ET-3) at Trp(21)-Ile(22), yielding ET-3, and, to a much lesser extent, also cleaved big ET-1 and big ET-2 at Trp(21)-Val(22), yielding ET-1 and ET-2. Enzymatic activity was partially inhibited by phosphoramidon. s-Kell has an acidic pH optimum (pH 6.0 to 6.5). Like the recombinant protein, red blood cells of common Kell phenotype also preferentially process big ET-3, in contrast to Ko (null) cells that do not. These data demonstrate that the Kell blood group protein is a proteolytic enzyme that processes big ET-3, generating ET-3, a potent bioactive peptide with multiple biological roles.",,
19897580,"Proteomics-based discovery of a novel, structurally unique, and developmentally regulated plasminogen receptor, Plg-RKT, a major regulator of cell surface plasminogen activation.","Activation of plasminogen, the zymogen of the primary thrombolytic enzyme, plasmin, is markedly promoted when plasminogen is bound to cell surfaces, arming cells with the broad spectrum proteolytic activity of plasmin. In addition to its role in thrombolysis, cell surface plasmin facilitates a wide array of physiologic and pathologic processes. Carboxypeptidase B-sensitive plasminogen binding sites promote plasminogen activation on eukaryotic cells. However, no integral membrane plasminogen receptors exposing carboxyl terminal basic residues on cell surfaces have been identified. Here we use the exquisite sensitivity of multidimensional protein identification technology and an inducible progenitor cell line to identify a novel differentiation-induced integral membrane plasminogen receptor that exposes a C-terminal lysine on the cell surface, Plg-R(KT) (C9orf46 homolog). Plg-R(KT) was highly colocalized on the cell surface with the urokinase receptor, uPAR. Our data suggest that Plg-R(KT) also interacts directly with tissue plasminogen activator. Furthermore, Plg-R(KT) markedly promoted cell surface plasminogen activation. Database searching revealed that Plg-R(KT) mRNA is broadly expressed by migratory cell types, including leukocytes, and breast cancer, leukemic, and neuronal cells. This structurally unique plasminogen receptor represents a novel control point for regulating cell surface proteolysis.",Blood,2010
20335479,Protogenin defines a transition stage during embryonic neurogenesis and prevents precocious neuronal differentiation.,"Many Ig superfamily members are expressed in the developing nervous system, but the functions of these molecules during neurogenesis are not all clear. Here, we explore the expression and function of one of members of this superfamily, protogenin (PRTG), in the developing nervous system. Expression of PRTG protein is strong in the neural tube of mouse embryos between embryonic days 7.75 and 9.5 but disappears after embryonic day 10.5 when the neural progenitor marker nestin expresses prominently. Perturbation of PRTG activity in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells and in chick embryos, by either RNA interference or a dominant-negative PRTG mutant, increases neuronal differentiation. Using yeast two-hybrid screening and an in situ binding assay, we were able to identify ERdj3 (a stress-inducible endoplasmic reticulum DnaJ homolog) as a putative PRTG ligand. Addition of purified ERdj3 protein into the P19 differentiation assay reduced neurogenesis. This effect was blocked by addition of either a neutralizing antibody against PRTG or purified PRTG ectodomain protein, indicating that the effect of ERdj3 on neurogenesis is mediated through PRTG. Forced expression of ERdj3 in the chick neural tube also impairs neuronal differentiation. Together, these results suggest that expression of PRTG defines a stage between pluripotent epiblasts and committed neural progenitors, and its signaling plays a critical role in suppressing premature neuronal differentiation during early neural development.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2010
9990065,Prototypic G protein-coupled receptor for the intestinotrophic factor glucagon-like peptide 2.,"Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) is a 33-aa proglucagon-derived peptide produced by intestinal enteroendocrine cells. GLP-2 stimulates intestinal growth and up-regulates villus height in the small intestine, concomitant with increased crypt cell proliferation and decreased enterocyte apoptosis. Moreover, GLP-2 prevents intestinal hypoplasia resulting from total parenteral nutrition. However, the mechanism underlying these actions has remained unclear. Here we report the cloning and characterization of cDNAs encoding rat and human GLP-2 receptors (GLP-2R), a G protein-coupled receptor superfamily member expressed in the gut and closely related to the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors. The human GLP-2R gene maps to chromosome 17p13.3. Cells expressing the GLP-2R responded to GLP-2, but not GLP-1 or related peptides, with increased cAMP production (EC50 = 0.58 nM) and displayed saturable high-affinity radioligand binding (Kd = 0.57 nM), which could be displaced by synthetic rat GLP-2 (Ki = 0.06 nM). GLP-2 analogs that activated GLP-2R signal transduction in vitro displayed intestinotrophic activity in vivo. These results strongly suggest that GLP-2, like glucagon and GLP-1, exerts its actions through a distinct and specific novel receptor expressed in its principal target tissue, the gastrointestinal tract.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1999
29812912,Proximity Labeling by a Recombinant APEX2-FGF1 Fusion Protein Reveals Interaction of FGF1 with the Proteoglycans CD44 and CSPG4.,"Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) binds to specific FGF receptors (FGFRs) at the surface of target cells to initiate intracellular signaling. While heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are well-described coreceptors, it is uncertain whether there are additional binding sites for FGF1 at the cell surface. To address this, we devised and tested a method to identify novel binding sites for FGF1 at the cell surface, which may also be applicable for other protein ligands. We constructed an APEX2-FGF1 fusion protein to perform proximal biotin labeling of proteins following binding of the fusion protein to the cell surface. After functional validation of the fusion protein by a signaling assay, we used this method to identify binding sites for FGF1 on cell surfaces of living cells. We confirmed the feasibility of our approach by detection of FGFR4, a well-known and specific receptor for FGF1. We subsequently screened for novel interactors using RPE1 cells and identified the proteoglycans CSPG4 (NG2) and CD44. We found that FGF1 binds CD44 through its heparin-binding moiety. Moreover, we found that FGF1 was colocalized with both CSPG4 and CD44 at the cell surface, suggesting that these receptors act as storage molecules that create a reservoir of FGF1. Importantly, our data demonstrate that recombinant ligand-APEX2 fusion proteins can be used to identify novel receptor interactions on the cell surface.",Biochemistry,2018
29934346,PTPσ Drives Excitatory Presynaptic Assembly via Various Extracellular and Intracellular Mechanisms.,"Leukocyte common antigen-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) are hub proteins that organize excitatory and inhibitory synapse development through binding to various extracellular ligands. Here, we report that knockdown (KD) of the LAR-RPTP family member PTPσ reduced excitatory synapse number and transmission in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, whereas KD of PTPδ produced comparable decreases at inhibitory synapses, in both cases without altering expression levels of interacting proteins. An extensive series of rescue experiments revealed that extracellular interactions of PTPσ with Slitrks are important for excitatory synapse development. These experiments further showed that the intracellular D2 domain of PTPσ is required for induction of heterologous synapse formation by Slitrk1 or TrkC, suggesting that interaction of LAR-RPTPs with distinct intracellular presynaptic proteins, drives presynaptic machinery assembly. Consistent with this, double-KD of liprin-α2 and -α3 or KD of PTPσ substrates (N-cadherin and p250RhoGAP) in neurons inhibited Slitrk6-induced, PTPσ-mediated heterologous synapse formation activity. We propose a synaptogenesis model in presynaptic neurons involving LAR-RPTP-organized retrograde signaling cascades, in which both extracellular and intracellular mechanisms are critical in orchestrating distinct synapse types.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2018
9325300,Purification and characterization of the human interleukin-18 receptor.,"Interleukin (IL)-18 was identified as a molecule that induces IFN-gamma production and enhances NK cell cytotoxicity. In this paper, we report upon the purification and characterization of human IL-18 receptor (hIL-18R). We selected the Hodgkin's disease cell line, L428, as the most strongly hIL-18R-expressing cell line based on the results of binding assays. This binding was inhibited by IL-18 but not by IL-1beta. The dissociation constant (Kd) of 125I-IL-18 binding to L428 cells was about 18.5 nM, with 18,000 binding sites/cell. After immunizing mice with L428 cells and cloning, a single monoclonal antibody (mAb) against hIL-18R was obtained (mAb 117-10C). Sequentially, hIL-18R was purified from 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS)-extracted L428 cells by wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 4B chromatography and mAb 117-10C-Sepharose chromatography. The internal amino acid sequences of hIL-18R all matched those of human IL-1 receptor-related protein (IL-1Rrp), the ligand of which was unknown to date. When expressed in COS-1 cells, the cDNA of IL-1Rrp conferred IL-18 binding properties on the cells and the capacity for signal transduction. From these results, we conclude that a functional IL-18 receptor component is IL-1Rrp.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
8253796,Purification and characterization of the receptor for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide.,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a 38-amino acid peptide (PACAP38) or a truncated peptide with the same 27 amino-terminal residues (PACAP27). The PACAP receptor was solubilized from bovine brain membranes with digitonin and purified 30-fold by the combination of DEAE-Toyopearl and hydroxylapatite chromatographic analyses. The partially purified PACAP receptors were mixed with biotinylated PACAP27 to form receptor-ligand complexes and then adsorbed onto avidin-agarose. The adsorbed PACAP receptors were eluted with an acidic buffer containing 1.0 M NaCl (pH 4.0). The eluted receptors were purified further by hydroxylapatite and gel filtration chromatography. A single protein band with a M(r) = 55,000-60,000 was found in the final preparation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Affinity labeling of the purified receptors with 125I-PACAP27 labeled the M(r) 55,000-60,000 protein specifically. The dissociation constant and the specific activity of the purified receptors were 25.8 pM and 17.2 nmol of ligand binding per mg of protein, respectively. Inhibitory constants determined by competitive binding experiments were 30.0 pM for PACAP27, 4.6 pM for PACAP38, and 37.3 nM for vasoactive intestinal peptide. Therefore, the purified PACAP receptor retained high affinity and ligand specificity.

1694173,Purification and functional characterization of integrin alpha v beta 5. An adhesion receptor for vitronectin.,"We have purified a novel member of the integrin gene family from placenta that serves as a vitronectin receptor. This integrin is composed of the alpha v subunit and a beta subunit that we designate beta 5. Purification was accomplished by immunodepleting a placental extract of integrin alpha v beta 3, allowing us to purify alpha v beta 5 from the remaining extract by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography on LM 142-Sepharose, which binds to the alpha v subunit. Purification to homogeneity was subsequently achieved by affinity chromatography on wheat germ lectin-Sepharose. Western blot analysis with antibodies raised against alpha v beta 5 and alpha v beta 3 demonstrated that beta 3 and beta 5 were distinct but confirmed that the alpha subunit of the two integrins were immunologically identical. Similarly, antibodies that bind beta 3 proximal to the ligand-binding site failed to react with beta 5, indicating an architectural difference at the ligand-binding site of these related integrins. This structural difference apparently results in a functional distinction, since purified alpha v beta 3 bound to vitronectin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin, whereas integrin alpha v beta 5 bound preferentially to vitronectin. Finally, we demonstrate by three criteria that beta 5 and beta x, the latter of which was identified in lung carcinoma cells (Cheresh, D. A., Smith, J. W., Cooper, H. M., and Quaranta, V. (1989) Cell 57, 59-69), are identical. First, peptide maps of beta x and beta 5 are identical. Secondly, polyclonal antibodies raised against alpha v beta 5 immunoprecipitate both beta 5 and beta x, and finally, the amino-terminal amino acid sequences of beta x and beta 5 are identical.",,
17215244,Purification and identification of G protein-coupled receptor protein complexes under native conditions.,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of membrane receptors and are of major therapeutic importance. The identification of GPCR-associated proteins is an important step toward a better understanding of these receptors. However, current methods are not satisfying as only isolated receptor domains (intracellular loops or carboxyl-terminal tails) can be used as ""bait."" We report here a method based on tandem affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry that overcomes these limitations as the entire receptor is used to identify protein complexes formed in living mammalian cells. The human MT(1) and MT(2) melatonin receptors were chosen as model GPCRs. Both receptors were tagged with the tandem affinity purification tag at their carboxyl-terminal tails and expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Receptor solubilization and purification conditions were optimized. The method was validated by the co-purification of G(i) proteins, which are well known GPCR interaction partners but which are difficult to identify with current protein-protein interaction assays. Several new and functionally relevant MT(1)- and MT(2)-associated proteins were identified; some of them were common to both receptors, and others were specific for each subtype. Taken together, our protocol allowed for the first time the purification of GPCR-associated proteins under native conditions in quantities suitable for mass spectrometry analysis.",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,2007
10231374,Purification of receptor complexes of interleukin-10 stoichiometry and the importance of deglycosylation in their crystallization.,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic immunosuppressive cytokine that has a wide range of effects in controlling inflammatory responses. Viral IL-10 (vIL-10) is a homologue of human IL-10 (hIL-10) produced by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Both hIL-10 and vIL-10 bind to the soluble extracellular fragment of the cytokine receptor IL-10R1 (shIL-10R1). The stoichiometry of the vIL-10 : shIL-10R1 complex has been found to be the same as hIL-10 : shIL-10R1, with two vIL-10 dimers binding to four shIL-10R1 monomers. Complexes of both hIL-10 and vIL-10 with glycosylated shIL-10R1 could not be crystallized. Controlled deglycosylation using peptide : N-glycosidase F and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F3 resulted in the formation of crystals of both hIL-10 : shIL-10R1 and vIL-10 : shIL-10R1 complexes, indicating that the difficulty in the crystal formation was largely due to the presence of complex carbohydrate side chains. The availability of the structure of the ligand-receptor complexes should facilitate our understanding of the basis of the interaction between IL-10 and the IL-10 receptor.",,

16602827,Purified Wnt5a protein activates or inhibits beta-catenin-TCF signaling depending on receptor context.,"The Wnts comprise a large class of secreted proteins that control essential developmental processes such as embryonic patterning, cell growth, migration, and differentiation. In the most well-understood ""canonical"" Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt binding to Frizzled receptors induces beta-catenin protein stabilization and entry into the nucleus, where it complexes with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcription factors to affect the transcription of target genes. In addition to the canonical pathway, evidence for several other Wnt signaling pathways has accumulated, in particular for Wnt5a, which has therefore been classified as a noncanonical Wnt family member. To study the alternative mechanisms by which Wnt proteins signal, we purified the Wnt5a protein to homogeneity. We find that purified Wnt5a inhibits Wnt3a protein-induced canonical Wnt signaling in a dose-dependent manner, not by influencing beta-catenin levels but by downregulating beta-catenin-induced reporter gene expression. The Wnt5a signal is mediated by the orphan tyrosine kinase Ror2, is pertussis toxin insensitive, and does not influence cellular calcium levels. We show that in addition to its inhibitory function, Wnt5a can also activate beta-catenin signaling in the presence of the appropriate Frizzled receptor, Frizzled 4. Thus, this study shows for the first time that a single Wnt ligand can initiate discrete signaling pathways through the activation of two distinct receptors. Based on these and additional observations, we propose a model wherein receptor context dictates Wnt signaling output. In this model, signaling by different Wnt family members is not intrinsically regulated by the Wnt proteins themselves but by receptor availability.",PLoS biology,2006

In order to identify the cellular ligands recognized by ""orphan"" triggering receptors, mice were immunized with NK susceptible target cells. mAbs were selected that inhibited NK cytotoxicity and recognized two different molecules of 70 and 60-65 kDa. Tryptic digestion and mass spectra analysis of purified proteins identified these molecules as PVR and Nectin-2, respectively. PVR-Fc and Nectin-2-Fc chimeric molecules stained COS-7 cells expressing the DNAM-1 activating receptor and conversely, PVR and Nectin-2 CHO-K cell transfectants were stained by DNAM-1-Fc. Thus, both PVR and Nectin-2 represent specific ligands for DNAM-1.

12421602,Quantitative autoradiographic distribution of NPFF1 neuropeptide FF receptor in the rat brain and comparison with NPFF2 receptor by using [125I]YVP and [(125I]EYF as selective radioligands.,"The selectivity of two new radioligands, [(125)I]YVP ([(125)I]YVPNLPQRF-NH(2)) and [(125)I]EYF ([(125)I]EYWSLAAPQRF-NH(2)), for neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor subtypes was determined using HEK293 cells expressing hNPFF(1) and CHO cells expressing hNPFF(2) receptors. Saturation binding and displacement experiments showed that [(125)I]YVP and [(125)I]EYF bound selectively with a very high affinity, K(D)=0.18 nM and 0.06 nM, to NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptors respectively. By using in vitro autoradiography with these radioligands and frog pancreatic polypeptide (PP) as selective unlabelled competitor of NPFF(2) binding sites, NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptor distribution was analyzed throughout the rat CNS. The highest densities of [(125)I]EYF binding sites were seen in the most external layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the parafascicular thalamic nucleus, laterodorsal thalamic nucleus and presubiculum of hippocampus. All specific binding of this radioligand was inhibited by 200 nM frog PP. The density of 0.1 nM [(125)I]YVP binding was much smaller in all brain areas and frog PP-insensitive binding sites (NPFF(1) receptor subtype) were detected in septal, thalamic and hypothalamic areas but were absent in the spinal cord. The restricted distribution of NPFF(1) receptors in the CNS supports its specific role in a limited number of neuronal functions. In contrast to the rat spinal cord where the NPFF(1) system is absent, there is no strict separation between NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) system at the supraspinal level.",Neuroscience,2002
26124272,Quantitative Characterization of E-selectin Interaction with Native CD44 and P-selectin Glycoprotein Ligand-1 (PSGL-1) Using a Real Time Immunoprecipitation-based Binding Assay.,"Selectins (E-, P-, and L-selectins) interact with glycoprotein ligands to mediate the essential tethering/rolling step in cell transport and delivery that captures migrating cells from the circulating flow. In this work, we developed a real time immunoprecipitation assay on a surface plasmon resonance chip that captures native glycoforms of two well known E-selectin ligands (CD44/hematopoietic cell E-/L-selectin ligand and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1) from hematopoietic cell extracts. Here we present a comprehensive characterization of their binding to E-selectin. We show that both ligands bind recombinant monomeric E-selectin transiently with fast on- and fast off-rates, whereas they bind dimeric E-selectin with remarkably slow on- and off-rates. This binding requires the sialyl Lewis x sugar moiety to be placed on both O- and N-glycans, and its association, but not dissociation, is sensitive to the salt concentration. Our results suggest a mechanism through which monomeric selectins mediate initial fast on and fast off kinetics to help capture cells out of the circulating shear flow; subsequently, tight binding by dimeric/oligomeric selectins is enabled to significantly slow rolling.",,
18400942,R-Spondin family members regulate the Wnt pathway by a common mechanism.,"The R-Spondin (RSpo) family of secreted proteins is implicated in the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Despite the high structural homology between the four members, expression patterns and phenotypes in knockout mice have demonstrated striking differences. Here we dissected and compared the molecular and cellular function of all RSpo family members. Although all four RSpo proteins activate the canonical Wnt pathway, RSpo2 and 3 are more potent than RSpo1, whereas RSpo4 is relatively inactive. All RSpo members require Wnt ligands and LRP6 for activity and amplify signaling of Wnt3A, Wnt1, and Wnt7A, suggesting that RSpo proteins are general regulators of canonical Wnt signaling. Like RSpo1, RSpo2-4 antagonize DKK1 activity by interfering with DKK1 mediated LRP6 and Kremen association. Analysis of RSpo deletion mutants indicates that the cysteine-rich furin domains are sufficient and essential for the amplification of Wnt signaling and inhibition of DKK1, suggesting that Wnt amplification by RSpo proteins may be a direct consequence of DKK1 inhibition. Together, these findings indicate that RSpo proteins modulate the Wnt pathway by a common mechanism and suggest that coexpression with specific Wnt ligands and DKK1 may determine their biological specificity in vivo.",,
21693646,R-spondins function as ligands of the orphan receptors LGR4 and LGR5 to regulate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.,"The Wnt/β-catenin signaling system plays essential roles in embryonic development and in the self-renewal and maintenance of adult stem cells. R-spondins (RSPOs) are a group of secreted proteins that enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling and have pleiotropic functions in development and stem cell growth. LGR5, an orphan receptor of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, is specifically expressed in stem cells of the intestinal crypt and hair follicle. Knockout of LGR5 in the mouse results in neonatal lethality. LGR4, a receptor closely related to LGR5, also has essential roles in development, as its knockout leads to reduced viability and retarded growth. Overexpression of both receptors has been reported in several types of cancer. Here we demonstrate that LGR4 and LGR5 bind the R-spondins with high affinity and mediate the potentiation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by enhancing Wnt-induced LRP6 phosphorylation. Interestingly, neither receptor is coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins or to β-arrestin when stimulated by the R-spondins, indicating a unique mechanism of action. The findings provide a basis for stem cell-specific effects of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and for the broad range of functions LGR4, LGR5, and the R-spondins have in normal and malignant growth.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2011
15292653,Radioligand binding and functional characterization of recombinant human NmU1 and NmU2 receptors stably expressed in clonal human embryonic kidney-293 cells.,"Neuromedin U (NmU) is a smooth muscle contracting peptide. Recently, two G-protein-coupled receptors for NmU (NmU1R and NmU2R) have been cloned having approximately 50% homology. They have distinct patterns of expression suggesting they may have different biological functions. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of both NmU receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. [125I]hNmU binding to the recombinant NmU receptors was rapid, saturable, of high affinity and to a single population of binding sites. Exposure of these cells to NmU isopeptides resulted in an increase in intracellular [Ca2+]i release (EC50 value of 0.50 +/- 0.10 nmol/l) and inositol phosphate formation (EC50 1.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.50 +/- 0.4 nmol/l for NmU1R and NmU2R respectively). Furthermore, hNmU inhibited forskolin (3 micromol/l)-stimulated accumulation of cAMP in intact HEK-293 cells expressing either NmU1R or NmU2R. The inhibitory effect was significant for the cells expressing NmU2R with IC50 value of 0.80 +/- 0.21 nmol/l. In summary, both NmU1R and NmU2R in HEK-293 cells have similar signaling capability.",Pharmacology,2004
9620797,RAMPs regulate the transport and ligand specificity of the calcitonin-receptor-like receptor.,"Calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin are related peptides with distinct pharmacological profiles. Here we show that a receptor with seven transmembrane domains, the calcitonin-receptor-like receptor (CRLR), can function as either a CGRP receptor or an adrenomedullin receptor, depending on which members of a new family of single-transmembrane-domain proteins, which we have called receptor-activity-modifying proteins or RAMPs, are expressed. RAMPs are required to transport CRLR to the plasma membrane. RAMP1 presents the receptor at the cell surface as a mature glycoprotein and a CGRP receptor. RAMP2-transported receptors are core-glycosylated and are adrenomedullin receptors.",Nature,1998

Both receptors regulated growth hormone release from the rat anterior pituitary gland. The availability of high-affinity, subtype-selective agonists for each of the somatostatin receptors provides a direct approach to defining their physiological functions.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1998
18287277,Rational design of a novel calcium-binding site adjacent to the ligand-binding site on CD2 increases its CD48 affinity.,"Electrostatic interactions are important for molecular recognition processes including Ca2+-binding and cell adhesion. To understand these processes, we have successfully introduced a novel Ca2+-binding site into the non-Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion protein CD2 using our criteria that are specifically tailored to the structural and functional properties of the protein environment and charged adhesion surface. This designed site with ligand residues exclusively from the beta-sheets selectively binds to Ca2+ and Ln3+ over other mono- and divalent cations. While Ca2+ and Ln3+ binding specifically alters the local environment of the designed Ca2+-binding site, the designed protein undergoes a significantly smaller conformation change compared with those observed in naturally occurring Ca2+-binding sites that are composed of at least part of the flexible loop and helical regions. In addition, the CD2-CD48-binding affinity increased approximately threefold after protein engineering, suggesting that the cell adhesion of CD2 can be modulated by altering the local electrostatic environment. The study provides site-specific information for regulating cell adhesion within CD2 and gives insight into the structural factors required for Ca2+-modulated biological processes.",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,2008

This receptor is widely distributed in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract; target disruption leads to obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, however, its role in physiological and pathological processes remain unknown due to lack of selective ligands or identification of its natural ligand. We have recently discovered (Mantey, S. A., Weber, H. C., Sainz, E., Akeson, M., Ryan, R. R. Pradhan, T. K., Searles, R. P., Spindel, E. R., Battey, J. F., Coy, D. H., and Jensen, R. T. (1997) J.

However, use of this ligand is limited because it has high affinity for all known Bn receptors. In the present study we have attempted to identify BRS-3 selective ligands using a strategy of rational peptide design with the substitution of conformationally restricted amino acids into the prototype ligand [d-Tyr(6),beta-Ala(11),Phe(13),Nle(14)]Bn-(6-14) or its d-Phe(6) analogue. Each of the 22 peptides synthesized had binding affinities determined for hBRS-3, hGRPR, and hNMBR, and hBRS-3 selective ligands were tested for their ability to activate phospholipase C and increase inositol phosphates ([(3)H]inositol phosphate). Using this approach we have identified a number of BRS-3 selective ligands. These ligands functioned as receptor agonists and their binding affinities were reflected in their potencies for altering [(3)H]inositol phosphate. Two peptides with an (R)- or (S)-amino-3-phenylpropionic acid substitution for beta-Ala(11) in the prototype ligand had the highest selectivity for the hBRS-3 over the mammalian Bn receptors and did not interact with receptors for other gastrointestinal hormones/neurotransmitters. Molecular modeling demonstrated these two selective BRS-3 ligands had a unique conformation of the position 11 beta-amino acid. This selectivity was of sufficient magnitude that these should be useful in explaining the role of hBRS-3 activation in obesity, glucose homeostasis, hypertension, and other physiological or pathological processes.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
11382746,Real-time monitoring of the interactions of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta ) isoforms with latency-associated protein and the ectodomains of the TGF-beta type II and III receptors reveals different kinetic models and stoichiometries of binding.,"Mature transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is proteolytically derived from the C terminus of a precursor protein. Latency-associated protein (LAP), the N-terminal remnant of the TGF-beta precursor, is able to bind and neutralize TGF-beta. Mature TGF-beta exerts its activity by binding and complexing members of two subfamilies of receptors, the type I and II receptors. In addition to these signaling receptors, TGF-beta can also interact with an accessory receptor termed the type III receptor. Using a surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor (BIAcore), we determined the mechanisms of interaction of four binding proteins (LAP, the type II and III receptor ectodomains (EDs), and a type II receptor ED/Fc chimera) with three TGF-beta isoforms, and we quantified their related kinetic parameters. Using global fitting based on a numerical integration data analysis method, we demonstrated that LAP and the type II receptor/Fc chimera interacted with the TGF-beta isoforms with a 1:1 stoichiometry. In contrast, the type II ED interactions with TGF-beta were best fit by a kinetic model assuming the presence of two independent binding sites on the ligand molecule. We also showed that the type III ED bound two TGF-beta molecules. Further experiments revealed that LAP was able to block the interactions of TGF-beta with the two EDs, but that the two EDs did not compete or cooperate with each other. Together, these results strongly support the existence of a cell-surface complex consisting of one type III receptor, two TGF-beta molecules, and four type II receptors, prior to the recruitment of the type I receptor for signal transduction. Additionally, our results indicate that the apparent dissociation rate constants are more predictive of the neutralizing potency of these TGF-beta-binding proteins (LAP, the type II and III receptor EDs, and the type II receptor/Fc chimera) than the apparent equilibrium constants.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
16500002,"Recent advances in mammalian RFamide peptides: the discovery and functional analyses of PrRP, RFRPs and QRFP.","Since the first discovery of a peptide with RFamide structure at its C-terminus (i.e., an RFamide peptide) from an invertebrate in 1977, numerous studies on RFamide peptides have been conducted, and a variety have been identified in various phyla throughout the animal kingdom. The first reported mammalian RFamide peptides were neuropeptide FF (NPFF) and neuropeptide AF (NPAF) in 1985. However, for many years after this, no new novel RFamide peptides were identified in mammals. A breakthrough in discovering mammalian RFamide peptides was made possible by reverse pharmacology on the basis of orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) research. The first report of an RFamide peptide identified from orphan GPCR research was prolactin (PRL)-releasing peptide (PrRP) in 1998. To date, a total of five RFamide peptide genes have been discovered in mammals. Orphan GPCR research has contributed considerably to the identification of these peptides and their receptor genes. This paper examines these mammalian RFamide peptides focusing especially on PrRP, RFamide-related peptides (RFRPs) and, the most recently identified, pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide (QRFP), the discovery of all of which the authors were at least partly involved in. We review here the strategies employed for the identification of these peptides and examine their characteristics, tissue distribution, receptors and functions.",,

Modulation of response by heparin.,"fgf3 has been implicated in the embryonic and fetal development of the mouse and as an oncogene in murine breast cancer. We describe a procedure to purify the product of the mouse fgf3 gene and show it to be a potent mitogen for some epithelial cell lines. Using a receptor binding competition assay, Fgf3 was shown to bind with high affinity to the IIIb isoforms of Fgf receptor (FgfR) 1 and FgfR2 (ID50 = approximately 0.8 nM) and with a lower affinity to the IIIc variant of FgfR2 (ID50 = approximately 9 nM). No competition for the binding of 125I-Fgf1 was observed for FgfR1 (IIIc), FgfR3 (IIIb and IIIc), or FgfR4. Mitogenicity assays using BaF3 cells containing individual Fgf receptors showed a pattern of response in agreement with the receptor binding results. A comparison of two mammary epithelial cell lines showed a marked difference of potency and dependence upon heparin in their response to mouse Fgf3, suggesting a complex interaction between the ligand and its low and high affinity receptors.",,
11700046,Receptor binding kinetics of human IL-3 variants with altered proliferative activity.,"The binding kinetics of native IL-3 and a set of truncated IL-3 variants to the alpha subunit of the IL-3 receptor (IL-3Ralpha) were studied using surface plasmon resonance. These variants, with amino acid substitutions at residues, 22, 42, 43, 45, 46, 113, or 116, have previously been identified to have altered capacity to stimulate cell proliferation compared to native IL-3(1-133). In this study, variants E43N and F113Y exhibited >100-fold slower association rates than IL-3(15-125) consistent with residues 43 and 113 being essential for the binding of IL-3 to the IL-3Ralpha. Variants G42A, G42D, Q45V, D46S, K116V, and K116W exhibited increased association rates (up to 15-fold relative to IL-3(15-125)) and decreased dissociation rates (up to 7-fold). The results demonstrate that both the association and dissociation rates for the binding of IL-3 to the IL-3Ralpha are altered by truncation and by amino acid substitution at individual sites.

10851242,Receptor for the pain modulatory neuropeptides FF and AF is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor.,"Opiate tolerance and dependence are major clinical and social problems. The anti-opiate neuropeptides FF and AF (NPFF and NPAF) have been implicated in pain modulation as well as in opioid tolerance and may play a critical role in this process, although their mechanism of action has remained unknown. Here we describe a cDNA encoding a novel neuropeptide Y-like human orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), referred to as HLWAR77 for which NPAF and NPFF have high affinity. Cells transiently or stably expressing HLWAR77 bind and respond in a concentration-dependent manner to NPAF and NPFF and are also weakly activated by FMRF-amide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide) and a variety of related peptides. The high affinity and potency of human NPFF and human NPAF for HLWAR77 strongly suggest that these are the cognate ligands for this receptor. Expression of HLWAR77 was demonstrated in brain regions associated with opiate activity, consistent with the pain-modulating activity of these peptides, whereas the expression in adipose tissue suggests other physiological and pathophysiological activities for FMRF-amide neuropeptides. The discovery that the anti-opiate neuropeptides are the endogenous ligands for HLWAR77 will aid in defining the physiological role(s) of these ligands and facilitate the identification of receptor agonists and antagonists.",,
7642713,Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu associates with cadherins and catenins in vivo.,"The extracellular segment of the receptor-type type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu, possesses an MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats. It binds homophilically, i.e., PTPmu on the surface of one cell binds to PTPmu on an apposing cell, and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain. The intracellular segment of PTPmu has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. In cadherins, this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we demonstrate that PTPmu associates with a complex containing cadherins, alpha- and beta-catenin in mink lung (MvLu) cells, and in rat heart, lung, and brain tissues. Greater than 80% of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X-100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PTPmu; however, the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent, SDS-containing RIPA buffer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of PTPmu binds directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, but not to alpha- or beta-catenin. Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo, PTPmu, cadherins, and catenins all localized to points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical staining. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including PTPmu, the cadherins associated with PTPmu are now found in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for PTPmu. These data suggest that PTPmu may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus function, of the cadherin/catenin complex in vivo.",The Journal of cell biology,1995
8626516,Receptor recognition and specificity of interleukin-8 is determined by residues that cluster near a surface-accessible hydrophobic pocket.,"To determine the regions of interleukin-8 (IL-8) that allow high affinity and interleukin-8 receptor type 1 (IL8R1)-specific binding of chemokines, we produced chimeric proteins containing structural domains from IL-8, which binds to both IL8R1 and interleukin-8 receptor type 2 (IL8R2) with high affinity, and from GRO gamma, which does not bind to IL8R1 and binds to IL8R2 with reduced affinity. Receptor binding activity was tested by competition of 125I-IL-8 binding to recombinant IL8R1 and IL8R2 cell lines. Substitution into IL-8 of the GRO gamma sequences corresponding to either the amino-terminal loop (amino acids 1-18) or the first beta-sheet (amino acids 18-32) reduced binding to both IL8R1 and IL8R2. The third beta-sheet of IL-8 (amino acids 46-53) was required for binding to IL8R1 but not IL8R2. Exchanges of the second beta-sheet (amino acids 32-46) or the carboxyl-terminal alpha-helix (amino acids 53-72) had no significant effect. When IL-8 sequences were substituted into GRO gamma, a single domain containing the second beta-sheet of IL-8 (amino acids 18-32) was sufficient to confer high affinity binding for both IL8R1 and IL8R2. The amino-terminal loop (amino acids 1-18) and the third beta-sheet (amino acids 46-53) of IL-8 had little effect when substituted individually but showed increased binding to both receptors when substituted in combination. Individual amino acid substitutions were made at positions where IL-8 and GRO gamma sequences differ within the regions of residues 11-21 and 46-53. IL-8 mutations L49A or L49F selectively inhibited binding to IL8R1. Mutations Y13L and F21N enhanced binding to IL8R1 with little effect on IL8R2. A combined mutation Y13L/S14Q selectively decreased binding to IL8R2. Residues Tyr13, Ser14, Phe21, and Lys49 are clustered in and around a surface-accessible hydrophobic pocket on IL-8 that is physically distant from the previously identified ELR binding sequence. A homology model of GRO gamma, constructed from the known structure of IL-8 by refinement calculations, indicated that access to the hydrophobic pocket was effectively abolished in GRO gamma. These studies suggest that the surface hydrophobic pocket and/or adjacent residues participate in IL-8 receptor recognition for both IL8R1 and IL8R2 and that the hydrophobic pocket itself may be essential for IL8R1 binding. Thus this region contains a second site for IL-8 receptor recognition that, in combination with the Glu4-Leu5-Arg6 region, can modulate receptor binding affinity and IL8R1 specificity.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996

Using these receptor preparations, we examined the binding affinities of ANP, BNP, and CNP for the C-receptor and their potencies for cGMP production via the ANP-A receptor (GC-A) and the ANP-B receptor (GC-B). These analyses revealed the presence of a marked species difference in the receptor selectivity of the natriuretic peptide family, especially among BNPs. Therefore, we investigated the receptor selectivity of the natriuretic peptide family using the homologous assay system with endogenous ligands and receptors of the same species. The rank order of binding affinity for the C-receptor was ANP greater than CNP greater than BNP in both humans and rats. The rank order of potency for cGMP production via the ANP-A receptor (GC-A) was ANP greater than or equal to BNP much greater than CNP, but that via the ANP-B receptor (GC-B) was CNP greater than ANP greater than or equal to BNP. These findings on the receptor selectivity of the natriuretic peptide family provide a new insight into the understanding of the physiological and clinical implications of the natriuretic peptide system.",Endocrinology,1992
8663044,Receptor specificity of the fibroblast growth factor family.,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are essential molecules for mammalian development. The nine known FGF ligands and the four signaling FGF receptors (and their alternatively spliced variants) are expressed in specific spatial and temporal patterns. The activity of this signaling pathway is regulated by ligand binding specificity, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and the differential signaling capacity of individual FGF receptors. To determine potentially relevant ligand-receptor pairs we have engineered mitogenically responsive cell lines expressing the major splice variants of all the known FGF receptors. We have assayed the mitogenic activity of the nine known FGF ligands on these cell lines. These studies demonstrate that FGF 1 is the only FGF that can activate all FGF receptor splice variants. Using FGF 1 as an internal standard we have determined the relative activity of all the other members of the FGF family.

FGFs bind and activate alternatively spliced forms of four tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFRs 1-4). The spatial and temporal expression patterns of FGFs and FGFRs and the ability of specific ligand-receptor pairs to actively signal are important factors regulating FGF activity in a variety of biological processes. FGF signaling activity is regulated by the binding specificity of ligands and receptors and is modulated by extrinsic cofactors such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In previous studies, we have engineered BaF3 cell lines to express the seven principal FGFRs and used these cell lines to determine the receptor binding specificity of FGFs 1-9 by using relative mitogenic activity as the readout. Here we have extended these semiquantitative studies to assess the receptor binding specificity of the remaining FGFs 10-23. This study completes the mitogenesis-based comparison of receptor specificity of the entire FGF family under standard conditions and should help in interpreting and predicting in vivo biological activity.",,
11481429,Receptor subtype-specific pronociceptive and analgesic actions of galanin in the spinal cord: selective actions via GalR1 and GalR2 receptors.,"Galanin is a 29-aa neuropeptide with a complex role in pain processing. Several galanin receptor subtypes are present in dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord with a differential distribution. Here, we describe a generation of a specific galanin R2 (GalR2) agonist, AR-M1896, and its application in studies of a rat neuropathic pain model (Bennett). The results show that in normal rats mechanical and cold allodynia of the hindpaw are induced after intrathecal infusion of low-dose galanin (25 ng per 0.5 microl/h). The same effect is seen with equimolar doses of AR-M1896 or AR-M961, an agonist both at GalR1 and GalR2 receptors. In allodynic Bennett model rats, the mechanical threshold increased dose-dependently after intrathecal injection of a high dose of AR-M961, whereas no effect was observed in the control or AR-M1896 group. No effect of either of the two compounds was observed in nonallodynic Bennett model rats. These data indicate that a low dose of galanin has a nociceptive role at the spinal cord level mediated by GalR2 receptors, whereas the antiallodynic effect of high-dose galanin on neuropathic pain is mediated by the GalR1 receptors. Thus, a selective GalR1 agonist may be used to treat neuropathic pain.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2001
10854424,Receptor subunit-specific action of oncostatin M in hepatic cells and its modulation by leukemia inhibitory factor.,"The related cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin M (OSM), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) direct the formation of specific heteromeric receptor complexes to achieve signaling. Each complex includes the common signal-transducing subunit gp130. OSM and LIF also recruit the signaling competent, but structurally distinct OSMRbeta and LIFRalpha subunits, respectively. To test the hypothesis that the particularly prominent cell regulation by OSM is due to signals contributed by OSMRbeta, we introduced stable expression of human or mouse OSMRbeta in rat hepatoma cells which have endogenous receptors for IL-6 and LIF, but not OSM. Both mouse and human OSM engaged gp130 with their respective OSMRbeta subunits, but only human OSM also acted through LIFR. Signaling by OSMRbeta-containing receptors was characterized by highest activation of STAT5 and ERK, recruitment of the insulin receptor substrate and Jun-N-terminal kinase pathways, and induction of a characteristic pattern of acute phase proteins. Since LIF together with LIFRalpha appear to form a more stable complex with gp130 than OSM with gp130 and OSMRbeta, co-activation of LIFR and OSMR resulted in a predominant LIF-like response. These results suggest that signaling by IL-6 cytokines is not identical, and that a hierarchical order of cytokine receptor action exists in which LIFR ranks as dominant member.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
25074926,"Receptor tyrosine kinases, TYRO3, AXL, and MER, demonstrate distinct patterns and complex regulation of ligand-induced activation.","TYRO3, AXL, and MER receptors (TAMs) are three homologous type I receptor-tyrosine kinases that are activated by endogenous ligands, protein S (PROS1) and growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6). These ligands can either activate TAMs as soluble factors, or, in turn, opsonize phosphatidylserine (PS) on apoptotic cells (ACs) and serve as bridging molecules between ACs and TAMs. Abnormal expression and activation of TAMs have been implicated in promoting proliferation and survival of cancer cells, as well as in suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Despite the fact that TAM receptors share significant similarity, little is known about the specificity of interaction between TAM receptors and their ligands, particularly in the context of ACs, and about the functional diversity of TAM receptors. To study ligand-mediated activation of TAMs, we generated a series of reporter cell lines expressing chimeric TAM receptors. Using this system, we found that each TAM receptor has a unique pattern of interaction with and activation by GAS6 and PROS1, which is also differentially affected by the presence of ACs, PS-containing lipid vesicles and enveloped virus. We also demonstrated that γ-carboxylation of ligands is essential for the full activation of TAMs and that soluble immunoglobulin-like TAM domains act as specific ligand antagonists. These studies demonstrate that, despite their similarity, TYRO3, AXL, and MER are likely to perform distinct functions in both immunoregulation and the recognition and removal of ACs.",,
8264577,Receptor tyrosine phosphatase R-PTP-kappa mediates homophilic binding.,"Receptor tyrosine phosphatases (R-PTPases) feature PTPase domains in the context of a receptor-like transmembrane topology. The R-PTPase R-PTP-kappa displays an extracellular domain composed of fibronectin type III motifs, a single immunoglobulin domain, as well as a recently defined MAM domain (Y.-P. Jiang, H. Wang, P. D'Eustachio, J.M. Musacchio, J. Schlessinger, and J. Sap, Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:2942-2951, 1993). We report here that R-PTP-kappa can mediate homophilic intercellular interaction. Inducible expression of the R-PTP-kappa protein in heterologous cells results in formation of stable cellular aggregates strictly consisting of R-PTP-kappa-expressing cells. Moreover, the purified extracellular domain of R-PTP-kappa functions as a substrate for adhesion by cells expressing R-PTP-kappa and induces aggregation of coated synthetic beads. R-PTP-kappa-mediated intercellular adhesion does not require PTPase activity or posttranslational proteolytic cleavage of the R-PTP-kappa protein and is calcium independent. The results suggest that R-PTPases may provide a link between cell-cell contact and cellular signaling events involving tyrosine phosphorylation.",,
11023820,Receptor-activity-modifying protein 1 forms heterodimers with two G-protein-coupled receptors to define ligand recognition.,"Receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) with single transmembrane domains define the function of two G-protein-coupled receptors of the B family. Cell-surface complexes of human RAMP1 (hRAMP1) and human calcitonin (CT) receptor isotype 2 (hCTR2) or rat CT-receptor-like receptor (rCRLR) have now been identified through protein cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. They are two distinct CT-gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors coupled to cAMP production and pharmacologically distinguished by the CT and CGRP antagonists salmon CT(8-32) and human or rat CGRP(8-37). Thus direct molecular interactions of hRAMP1 with hCTR2 or rCRLR are required for CGRP recognition. hCTR2, moreover, adopts non-traditional functions through its association with hRAMP1.",,
23744080,Receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase ζ is a functional receptor for interleukin-34.,"Interleukin-34 (IL-34) is highly expressed in brain. IL-34 signaling via its cognate receptor, colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), is required for the development of microglia. However, the differential expression of IL-34 and the CSF-1R in brain suggests that IL-34 may signal via an alternate receptor. By IL-34 affinity chromatography of solubilized mouse brain membrane followed by mass spectrometric analysis, we identified receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase ζ (PTP-ζ), a cell surface chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan, as a novel IL-34 receptor. PTP-ζ is primarily expressed on neural progenitors and glial cells and is highly expressed in human glioblastomas. IL-34 selectively bound PTP-ζ in CSF-1R-deficient U251 human glioblastoma cell lysates and inhibited the proliferation, clonogenicity, and motility of U251 cells in a PTP-ζ-dependent manner. These effects were correlated with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the previously identified PTP-ζ downstream effectors focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. IL-34 binding to U251 cells was abrogated by chondroitinase ABC treatment, and CS competed with IL-34 for binding to the extracellular domain of PTP-ζ and to the cells, indicating a dependence of binding on PTP-ζ CS moieties. This study identifies an alternate receptor for IL-34 that may mediate its action on novel cellular targets.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2013
12529937,"Receptors for calcitonin gene-related peptide, adrenomedullin, and amylin: the contributions of novel receptor-activity-modifying proteins.","The discovery of receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMP) revealed a new principle for the function of G protein-coupled receptors. The initially orphan calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) was identified as a CGRP receptor when coexpressed with RAMP1. The same receptor is specific for adrenomedullin (ADM) in the presence of RAMP2. Calcitonin receptors (CTR) with 60% homology to the CRLR predominantly recognize calcitonin in the absence of RAMP. An amylin/CGRP receptor was recognized when a calcitonin receptor (CTR) was coexpressed with RAMP1. In the presence of RAMP3, the CTR only interacts with amylin. Noncovalent association of the RAMP with the CRLR or the CTR reveals heterodimeric RAMP/receptor complexes at the cell surface. Thus, two Class II G protein-coupled receptors, the CRLR and CTR, associate with three RAMP to form high affinity receptors for CGRP, ADM, or amylin. Here, the molecular composition and the functional properties of these receptors is reviewed.",,
8999945,Recognition of phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic spermatogenic cells and subsequent phagocytosis by Sertoli cells of the rat.,"In a primary co-culture of spermatogenic and Sertoli cells of the rat, many spermatogenic cells die by apoptosis and are subsequently engulfed by Sertoli cells. We investigated the mechanism of this phagocytosis reaction. Testicular cells from 20-day-old rats were cultured, and spermatogenic cells and Sertoli cells were separated. When the recovered spermatogenic cells were maintained without Sertoli cells, the viability of the cells decreased and they became more susceptible to phagocytosis by Sertoli cells. Phagocytosis was severely impaired when liposomes containing acidic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and cardiolipin, were included in the reaction, whereas those consisting of neutral phospholipids showed little effect. Such anionic liposomes were more efficiently engulfed by Sertoli cells than were the other neutral liposomes. Also, the number of spermatogenic cells that exposed phosphatidylserine to the surface increased when cells were maintained in single culture. The results indicate that upon induction of spermatogenic cell apoptosis, phosphatidylserine and probably other acidic phospholipids, which are normally localized in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, translocate to the outer leaflet and serve as a signal for phagocytosis by Sertoli cells.",,
12909644,Recognition of the N-terminal modules of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 by alpha6beta1 integrin.,"In addition to its recognition by alpha3beta1 and alpha4beta1 integrins, the N-terminal pentraxin module of thrombospondin-1 is a ligand for alpha6beta1 integrin. alpha6beta1 integrin mediates adhesion of human microvascular endothelial and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells to immobilized thrombospondin-1 and recombinant N-terminal regions of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2. alpha6beta1 also mediates chemotaxis of microvascular cells to thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2. Using synthetic peptides, LALERKDHSG was identified as an alpha6beta1-binding sequence in thrombospondin-1. This peptide inhibited alpha6beta1-dependent cell adhesion to thrombospondin-1, thrombospondin-2, and the E8 fragment of murine laminin-1. The Glu residue in this peptide was required for activity, and the corresponding residue (Glu90) in the N-terminal module of thrombospondin-1 was required for its recognition by alpha6beta1, but not by alpha4beta1. alpha6beta1 was also expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells; but in these cells, only certain agonists could activate the integrin to recognize thrombospondins. Selective activation of alpha6beta1 integrin in microvascular endothelial cells by the anti-beta1 antibody TS2/16 therefore accounts for their adhesion responses to thrombospondins and explains the distinct functions of alpha4beta1 and alpha6beta1 integrins as thrombospondin receptors in microvascular and large vessel endothelial cells.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
8144591,"Recombinant human betacellulin. Molecular structure, biological activities, and receptor interaction.","Soluble forms of human betacellulin (BTC) were purified to homogeneity from the conditioned medium of mouse A9 cells transfected with the BTC precursor cDNA. Three types of soluble BTC, designated BTC-1a, BTC-1b and BTC-2, were resolved by cation-exchange and size-exclusion column chromatography. Physicochemical analysis has revealed that BTC-1a represents the glycosylated, intact molecule composed of 80 amino acid residues (Asp32 to Tyr111 of the precursor molecule). BTC-1b appears to be a truncated molecule lacking 12 amino acid residues from the amino terminus of BTC-1a. BTC-2 was found to be a 50-amino acid molecule (Arg62 to Tyr111) that corresponds to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) structural unit. The biological activities of these BTC molecules were essentially identical as judged by their mitogenicity on Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts. BTC and EGF were equipotent in stimulating Balb/c 3T3 cell proliferation and rat mesangial cell Ca2+ mobilization as well as in inhibiting the growth of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. BTC and EGF antagonized each other with similar dose dependence for binding to A431 cells, indicating that these factors bind the same receptor molecules with equivalent avidity. The Kd value of EGF receptor (EGFR) and BTC is 0.5 nM as determined on Balb/c 3T3 cells. In addition, human mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-453 cells, which express multiple members of the EGFR family, were found to possess 2.7 x 10(3) BTC binding sites/cell, and the binding was readily quenched by EGF. These results suggest that the primary receptor for BTC is EGFR.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1994
15571461,Recombinant human thyrotropins of the twenty-first century.,"In recent years, many new recombinant protein therapeutics have been developed and tested in clinical trials [1]. Current and future clinical uses of recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH; Thyrogen, Genzyme) in thyroid diseases are discussed in the review published in this issue of Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy [2]. As Thyrogen is a wild-type rhTSH produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, it has relatively low affinity to the human TSH receptor. Such low affinity and weak intrinsic bioactivity of rhTSH, compared to the bovine or rodent TSH, may help to explain the results of several studies indicating limited clinical efficacy of Thyrogen. TSH analogues with largely increased receptor affinity, potency and efficacy, are expected to provide not only more effective than currently used diagnostic methods, but should also serve as indispensable second-generation thyrotropins for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid carcinomas with a largely limited number of TSH receptors.",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,2004
11801734,Recycling ability of the mouse and the human neurotensin type 2 receptors depends on a single tyrosine residue.,"Receptor recycling plays a key role in the modulation of cellular responses to extracellular signals. The purpose of this work was to identify residues in G-protein coupled neurotensin receptors that are directly involved in recycling. Both the high affinity receptor-1 (NTR1) and the levocabastine-sensitive NTR2 are internalized after neurotensin binding. Here, we show that only the mouse NTR2 recycled to the plasma membrane, whereas the rat NTR1 and the human NTR2 did not. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that tyrosine 237 in the third intracellular loop is crucial for recycling of the mouse NTR2. We show that the mouse NTR2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by NT. This phosphorylation is essential for receptor recycling since the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocks this process. The absence of recycling observed with the human NTR2 could be completely explained by the presence of a cysteine instead of a tyrosine in position 237. Indeed, substitution of this cysteine by a tyrosine gave a mutant receptor that has acquired the ability to recycle to the cell surface after neurotensin-induced internalization. This work demonstrates that a single tyrosine residue in the third intracellular loop of a G-protein-coupled receptor is responsible for receptor phosphorylation and represents an essential structural element for receptor recycling.",Journal of cell science,2002
8596488,Reduction of epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation by activated Mullerian inhibiting substance is vanadate-sensitive.,"The carboxy-terminal domain of recombinant human Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) inhibits cellular proliferation in vitro and decreases epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. Proteolytically cleaved and undissociated MIS is more potent than carboxy-terminal MIS alone, supporting a functional role for the amino-terminal region of the molecule. MIS does not block EGF binding to the EGF receptor, thus, MIS reduction of EGF receptor phosphorylation must occur distal to receptor ligand binding. The effect of proteolytically cleaved MIS on reduction of EGF receptor phosphorylation in membrane preparations is decreased by a specific phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate, thus implicating a membrane phosphatase in this MIS action at the EGF receptor.",,
12167620,Reelin and ApoE receptors cooperate to enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning.,"Two apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptors, the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor and apoE receptor 2 (apoER2), are also receptors for Reelin, a signaling protein that regulates neuronal migration during brain development. In the adult brain, Reelin is expressed by GABA-ergic interneurons, suggesting a potential function as a modulator of neurotransmission. ApoE receptors have been indirectly implicated in memory and neurodegenerative disorders because their ligand, apoE, is genetically associated with Alzheimer disease. We have used knockout mice to investigate the role of Reelin and its receptors in cognition and synaptic plasticity. Mice lacking either the VLDL receptor or the apoER2 show contextual fear conditioning deficits. VLDL receptor-deficient mice also have a moderate defect in long term potentiation (LTP), and apoER2 knockouts have a pronounced one. The perfusion of mouse hippocampal slices with Reelin has no effect on baseline synaptic transmission but significantly enhances LTP in area CA1. This Reelin-dependent augmentation of LTP is abolished in VLDL receptor and apoER2 knockout mice. Our results reveal a role for Reelin in controlling synaptic plasticity in the adult brain and suggest that both of its receptors are necessary for Reelin-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Thus, the impairment of apoE receptor-dependent neuromodulation may contribute to cognitive impairment and synaptic loss in Alzheimer disease.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
10939329,Reelin binds alpha3beta1 integrin and inhibits neuronal migration.,"Mice that are mutant for Reelin or Dab1, or doubly mutant for the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) and ApoE receptor 2 (ApoER2), show disorders of cerebral cortical lamination. How Reelin and its receptors regulate laminar organization of cerebral cortex is unknown. We show that Reelin inhibits migration of cortical neurons and enables detachment of neurons from radial glia. Recombinant and native Reelin associate with alpha3beta1 integrin, which regulates neuron-glia interactions and is required to achieve proper laminar organization. The effect of Reelin on cortical neuronal migration in vitro and in vivo depends on interactions between Reelin and alpha3beta1 integrin. Absence of alpha3beta1 leads to a reduction of Dab1, a signaling protein acting downstream of Reelin. Thus, Reelin may arrest neuronal migration and promote normal cortical lamination by binding alpha3beta1 integrin and modulating integrin-mediated cellular adhesion.",Neuron,2000
10571240,Reelin is a ligand for lipoprotein receptors.,"A signaling pathway involving the extracellular protein Reelin and the intracellular adaptor protein Disabled-1 (Dab1) controls cell positioning during mammalian brain development. Here, we demonstrate that Reelin binds directly to lipoprotein receptors, preferably the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2). Binding requires calcium, and it is inhibited in the presence of apoE. Furthermore, the CR-50 monoclonal antibody, which inhibits Reelin function, blocks the association of Reelin with VLDLR. After binding to VLDLR on the cell surface, Reelin is internalized into vesicles. In dissociated neurons, apoE reduces the level of Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1. These data suggest that Reelin directs neuronal migration by binding to VLDLR and ApoER2.",Neuron,1999
11602681,Regions in rat and human parathyroid hormone (PTH) 2 receptors controlling receptor interaction with PTH and with antagonist ligands.,"The parathyroid hormone (PTH) 2 receptor is potently activated by tuberoinfundibular peptide (TIP39). Rat and human PTH2 receptors differ considerably in their PTH responsiveness. PTH weakly stimulates cAMP accumulation via the rat receptor, and here we show it did not detectably increase intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and bound with low affinity (450 nM). For the human PTH2 receptor PTH was a full agonist for increasing cAMP, a partial agonist for increasing [Ca2+]i, and bound with high affinity (18 nM). In addition, the antagonists PTH(7-34) and TIP(7-39) bound with 10- to 49-fold lower affinity to the rat receptor. We investigated the molecular basis of differential PTH and antagonist interaction with human and rat PTH2 receptors by using chimeric human/rat PTH2 receptors. PTH cAMP-signaling efficacy (Emax) was determined by extracellular loop (EL) 1 and a region including EL2 and EL3. The N-terminal domain determined PTH binding selectivity at the inactive receptor state. Multiple regions throughout the receptor are required for the PTH-PTH2 receptor complex to adopt a high-affinity active state: inserting the rat receptor's N-terminal domain, EL1 or EL2/3, into the human receptor increased PTH's EC50 and reciprocal exchanges did not reduce EC50. This suggests the global receptor conformation prevents the rat receptor from adopting a high-affinity state when in complex with PTH. N-terminal ligand truncation, producing the antagonists PTH(7-34) and TIP(7-39), altered ligand interaction with the membrane-embedded domain of the receptor, eliminating EL2/3 as a specificity determinant and lowering binding affinity. These insights should contribute to the development of a high-affinity PTH2 receptor antagonist, for investigating the receptor's physiological role.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2001
10918299,Regulation of activin's access to the cell: why is mother nature such a control freak?,"Activin A is a pluripotent growth factor with important roles in development, erythropoiesis and the local regulation of many tissues. At the post-translational level, the amount of activin A produced by cells may be modulated through the diversion of activin A subunits into the formation of inhibin or other activins containing heterodimeric forms. Once assembled, activin interacts with various low- and high-affinity binding proteins, such as follistatin and alpha(2)-macroglobulin, that have consequences for receptor availability. In common with other TGFbeta family members, activin signals through pairs of type I and II receptor kinases and the Smad intracellular signalling cascade. Other checkpoints have been identified such as the recently identified pseudoreceptor, BAMBI. These emerging findings point to a tightly coordinated regulation of the exposure of a cell or tissue to activin, consistent with the low amounts of this potent factor that are necessary to modulate cellular responses.",,
23154389,Regulation of endodermal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells through integrin-ECM interactions.,"Many cellular responses during development are regulated by interactions between integrin receptors and extracellular matrix proteins (ECMPs). Although the majority of recent studies in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation have focused on the role of growth factors, such as FGF, TGFβ, and WNT, relatively little is known about the role of ECMP-integrin signaling in this process. Moreover, current strategies to direct hESC differentiation into various lineages are inefficient and have yet to produce functionally mature cells in vitro. This suggests that additional factors, such as ECMPs, are required for the efficient differentiation of hESCs. Using a high-throughput multifactorial cellular array technology, we investigated the effect of hundreds of ECMP combinations and concentrations on differentiation of several hPSC lines to definitive endoderm (DE), an early embryonic cell population fated to give rise to internal organs such as the lung, liver, pancreas, stomach, and intestine. From this screen we identified fibronectin (FN) and vitronectin (VTN) as ECMP components that promoted DE differentiation. Analysis of integrin expression revealed that differentiation toward DE led to an increase in FN-binding integrin α5 (ITGA5) and VTN-binding integrin αV (ITGAV). Conditional short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of ITGA5 and ITGAV disrupted hESC differentiation toward DE. Finally, fluorescence-based cell sorting for ITGA5 and ITGAV significantly enriched cells with gene expression signatures associated with DE, demonstrating that these cell surface proteins permit isolation and enrichment of DE from hESCs. These data provide evidence that FN and VTN promote endoderm differentiation of hESCs through interaction with ITGA5 and ITGAV, and that ECMP-integrin interactions are required for hESC differentiation into functionally mature cells.",Cell death and differentiation,2013
15911069,Regulation of guanylyl cyclase/natriuretic peptide receptor-A gene expression.,"Natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPRA) is the biological receptor of the peptide hormones atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The level and activity of this receptor determines the biological effects of ANP and BNP in different tissues mainly directed towards the maintenance of salt and water homeostasis. The core transcriptional machinery of the TATA-less Npr1 gene, which encodes NPRA, consists of three SP1 binding sites and the inverted CCAAT box. This promoter region of Npr1 gene has been shown to contain several putative binding sites for the known transcription factors, but the functional significance of most of these regulatory sequences is yet to be elucidated. The present review discusses the current knowledge of the functional significance of the promoter region of Npr1 gene and its transcriptional regulation by a number of factors including different hormones, growth factors, changes in extracellular osmolarity, and certain physiological and patho-physiological conditions.",Peptides,2005
14599850,Regulation of immune and autoimmune responses by ICOS.,"Proper T cell activation and function are regulated by the innate immune system, importantly through positive and negative costimulatory molecules in the B7 superfamily. Inducible costimulator (ICOS), the receptor for B7h (also known as B7RP-1), is expressed on T cells after T cell activation. Recently, using ICOS-deficient mice, we have examined the roles of ICOS in immune responses. ICOS is required for humoral immunity. In organ-specific autoimmune responses, however, ICOS has contrast roles in different disease models. On the one hand, ICOS-/- mice exhibited extreme sensitivity to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); on the other, ICOS gene deletion led to complete resistance to collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. Our work not only illustrates the complexity of immune regulation by costimulatory molecules, but also suggests novel therapeutic strategies for various autoimmune diseases.",Journal of autoimmunity,2003
10531456,Regulation of learning by EphA receptors: a protein targeting study.,"EphA family receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin-A ligands are involved in patterning axonal connections during brain development, but until now a role for these molecules in the mature brain had not been elucidated. Here, we show that both the EphA5 receptor and its ephrin-A ligands (2 and 5) are expressed in the adult mouse hippocampus, and the EphA5 protein is present in a phosphorylated form. Because there are no pharmacological agents available for EphA receptors, we designed recombinant immunoadhesins that specifically bind to the receptor binding site of the ephrin-A ligand (antagonist) or the ligand binding site of the EphA receptor (agonist) and thus target EphA function. We demonstrate that intrahippocampal infusion of an EphA antagonist immunoadhesin leads to impaired performance in two behavioral paradigms, T-maze spontaneous alternation and context-dependent fear conditioning, sensitive to hippocampal function, whereas activation of EphA by infusion of an agonist immunoadhesin results in enhanced performance on these tasks. Because the two behavioral tasks have different motivational, perceptual, and motor requirements, we infer the changes were not caused by these performance factors but rather to cognitive alterations. We also find bidirectional changes in gene expression and in electrophysiological measures of synaptic efficacy that correlate with the behavioral results. Thus, EphA receptors and their ligands are implicated as mediators of plasticity in the adult mammalian brain.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,1999
23665349,"Regulation of liver growth by glypican 3, CD81, hedgehog, and Hhex.","Previous studies from our laboratory have found glypican 3 (GPC3) as a negative regulator of growth. CD81 was found to be a binding partner for GPC3, and its expression and co-localization with GPC3 increased at the end of hepatocyte proliferation. However, the mechanisms through which these two molecules might regulate liver regeneration are not known. We tested the hypothesis that GPC3 down-regulates the hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway by competing with patched-1 for HH binding. We found decreased GPC3-Indian HH binding at peak proliferation in mice followed by increase in glioblastoma 1 protein (effector of HH signaling). We performed a yeast two-hybrid assay and identified hematopoietically expressed homeobox (Hhex, a known transcriptional repressor) as a binding partner for CD81. We tested the hypothesis that Hhex binding to CD81 keeps it outside the nucleus. However, when GPC3 binds to CD81, CD81-Hhex binding decreases, resulting in nuclear translocation of Hhex and transcriptional repression. In support of this, we found decreased GPC3-CD81 binding at hepatocyte proliferation peak, increased CD81-Hhex binding, and decreased nuclear Hhex. GPC3 transgenic mice were used as an additional tool to test our hypothesis. Overall, our data suggest that GPC3 down-regulates cell proliferation by binding to HH and down-regulating the HH signaling pathway and binding with CD81, thus making it unavailable to bind to Hhex and causing its nuclear translocation.",The American journal of pathology,2013
11459935,Regulation of myostatin activity and muscle growth.,"Myostatin is a transforming growth factor-beta family member that acts as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. To identify possible myostatin inhibitors that may have applications for promoting muscle growth, we investigated the regulation of myostatin signaling. Myostatin protein purified from mammalian cells consisted of a noncovalently held complex of the N-terminal propeptide and a disulfide-linked dimer of C-terminal fragments. The purified C-terminal myostatin dimer was capable of binding the activin type II receptors, Act RIIB and, to a lesser extent, Act RIIA. Binding of myostatin to Act RIIB could be inhibited by the activin-binding protein follistatin and, at higher concentrations, by the myostatin propeptide. To determine the functional significance of these interactions in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing high levels of the propeptide, follistatin, or a dominant-negative form of Act RIIB by using a skeletal muscle-specific promoter. Independent transgenic mouse lines for each construct exhibited dramatic increases in muscle mass comparable to those seen in myostatin knockout mice. Our findings suggest that the propeptide, follistatin, or other molecules that block signaling through this pathway may be useful agents for enhancing muscle growth for both human therapeutic and agricultural applications.",,
8753867,Regulation of neuromodulatory actions of angiotensin II in the brain neurons by the Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates norepinephrine transporter (NET) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the neurons, but the signal transduction mechanism of this neuromodulation is not understood. Treatment of neuronal cultures of hypothalamus-brainstem with Ang II resulted in a time- and dose-dependent activation of Ras, Raf-1, and mitogen-activated protein kinase. This activation was mediated by the interaction of Ang II with the AT1, receptor subtype and was associated with the redistribution of AT1 receptor with Ras and Raf-1 on the neuronal membrane. Treatment with antisense oligonucleotide (AON) to mitogen-activated protein kinase decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase immunoreactivity by 70% and attenuated Ang II stimulation of c-fos, NET, and TH mRNA levels. This demonstrates that induction of these genes requires mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by Ang II. In contrast, AON to mitogen-activated protein kinase failed to inhibit Ang II stimulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mRNA levels. These results suggest that AT1 receptors are coupled to a Ras-Raf-1 mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway that is responsible for stimulation of NET and TH, two neuro-modulatory actions of Ang II in the brain.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,1996
12221720,Regulation of osteoclast differentiation and function by receptor activator of NFkB ligand and osteoprotegerin.,"The differentiation and functions of osteoclasts (OCs) are regulated by osteoblast-derived factors. Receptor activator of NFkB ligand (RANKL) is one of the key regulatory molecules in OC formation. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a novel secreted member of the TNF receptor superfamily that negatively regulates osteoclastogenesis and binds to RANKL. We examined the biological actions of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), RANKL, and OPG on the differentiation of OCs isolated from cocultures of mouse osteoblastic cells and bone marrow cells. Preosteoclasts (pOCs) and OCs were characterized by their ultrastructure and the expression of OC markers such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase. pOCs formed without any additives expressed TRAP, but showed little resorptive activity on cocultured dentine slices. TRAP-positive pOCs treated with M-CSF began to fuse with each other, but lacked a ruffled border (RB) and showed almost no resorptive activity. pOCs treated with RANKL became TRAP-positive multinucleated cells, which expressed intense vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase along the RB membranes and exhibited prominent resorptive activity. Such effects of RANKL on pOCs were completely inhibited by the addition of OPG. OPG inhibited RB formation in mature OCs and reduced their resorptive activity, and also induced apoptosis of some OCs. These results suggest that 1) RANKL induces differentiation of functional OCs from pOCs, 2) M-CSF induces macrophage-like multinucleated cells, but not OCs, 3) OPG inhibits RB formation and resorptive activity in mature OCs, 4) OPG also induces apoptosis of OCs, and 5) RANKL and OPG are, therefore, important regulators of not only the terminal differentiation of OCs but also their resorptive function.",,
9314546,"Regulation of tenascin-C, a vascular smooth muscle cell survival factor that interacts with the alpha v beta 3 integrin to promote epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation and growth.","Tenascin-C (TN-C) is induced in pulmonary vascular disease, where it colocalizes with proliferating smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Furthermore, cultured SMCs require TN-C for EGF-dependent growth on type I collagen. In this study, we explore the regulation and function of TN-C in SMCs. We show that a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor (GM6001) suppresses SMC TN-C expression on native collagen, whereas denatured collagen promotes TN-C expression in a beta 3 integrin- dependent manner, independent of MMPs. Floating type I collagen gel also suppresses SMC MMP activity and TN-C protein synthesis and induces apoptosis, in the presence of EGF. Addition of exogenous TN-C to SMCs on floating collagen, or to SMCs treated with GM6001, restores the EGF growth response and ""rescues"" cells from apoptosis. The mechanism by which TN-C facilitates EGF-dependent survival and growth was then investigated. We show that TN-C interactions with alpha v beta 3 integrins modify SMC shape, and EGF- dependent growth. These features are associated with redistribution of filamentous actin to focal adhesion complexes, which colocalize with clusters of EGF-Rs, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, and increased activation of EGF-Rs after addition of EGF. Cross-linking SMC beta 3 integrins replicates the effect of TN-C on EGF-R clustering and tyrosine phosphorylation. Together, these studies represent a functional paradigm for ECM-dependent cell survival whereby MMPs upregulate TN-C by generating beta 3 integrin ligands in type I collagen. In turn, alpha v beta 3 interactions with TN-C alter SMC shape and increase EGF-R clustering and EGF-dependent growth. Conversely, suppression of MMPs downregulates TN-C and induces apoptosis.",,
19564354,Regulation of TLR7/9 responses in plasmacytoid dendritic cells by BST2 and ILT7 receptor interaction.,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce copious type I interferon (IFN) upon sensing nucleic acids through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR9. Uncontrolled pDC activation and IFN production are implicated in lymphopenia and autoimmune diseases; therefore, a mechanism controlling pDC IFN production is essential. Human pDCs specifically express an orphan receptor, immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 (ILT7). Here, we discovered an ILT7 ligand expressed by human cell lines and identified it as bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2; CD317). BST2 directly binds to purified ILT7 protein, initiates signaling via the ILT7-FcepsilonRIgamma complex, and strongly inhibits production of IFN and proinflammatory cytokines by pDCs. Readily induced by IFN and other proinflammatory cytokines, BST2 may modulate the human pDC's IFN responses through ILT7 in a negative feedback fashion.",The Journal of experimental medicine,2009
9813179,Regulation of Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein-mediated cell adhesion by kininogens and their derivatives.,"MC3T3-E1 (mouse osteoblast-like) cells adhered to a tissue culture plate coated with human Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein (Znalpha2gp). The adhesion of MC3T3-E1 cells to Znalpha2gp was inhibited by synthetic peptides such as RGDS and ELRGDV, and by antibody against vitronectin receptor. These findings suggested that the RGD region of Znalpha2gp interacts with the vitronectin receptor (alphavbeta3) on the MC3T3-E1 cell surface. Furthermore, we found that the common heavy chain of both HMW- and LMW-kininogens accelerated the Znalpha2gp-mediated MC3T3-E1 cell adhesion. Among the three domains of the common heavy chain of both kininogens, domain 3 promoted the cell adhesion by up to 200%. Among the nine synthetic peptides covering domain 3, the peptide, N334AEVYVVPWEKKIYPTVN351 accelerated in a dose-dependent manner the Znalpha2gp- and vitronectin (VN)-mediated MC3T3-E1 cell adhesion. These findings suggested that a defined region of domain 3 is responsible for the acceleration of cell adhesion.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1998
28859966,Relative distribution and biological characterization of CXCL4L1 isoforms in platelets from healthy donors.,"CXCL4L1, a platelet-derived ELR-negative CXC chemokine, is a powerful angiostatic and anti-tumoral chemokine. We developed a mass spectrometric assay for the detection of different natural CXCL4L1 isoforms. Using this assay, we identified 4 different CXCL4L1 isoforms in the supernatant of thrombin-stimulated platelets from healthy volunteers: the classical isoform CXCL4L1(1-70), CXCL4L1(-4-70), which probably arises through alternative signal peptide removal and two COOH-terminally truncated isoforms CXCL4L1(1-69) and CXCL4L1(-4-69). CXCL4L1(1-70) was the most abundant isoform, whereas CXCL4L1(-4-70) was detected in 50% of the platelet preparations. Since alterations to the NH",,
16411781,Relaxin-3: improved synthesis strategy and demonstration of its high-affinity interaction with the relaxin receptor LGR7 both in vitro and in vivo.,"Relaxin-3 is a member of the human relaxin peptide family, the gene for which, RLN3, is predominantly expressed in the brain. Mapping studies in the rodent indicate a highly developed network of RLN3, RLN1, and relaxin receptor-expressing cells in the brain, suggesting that relaxin peptides have important functional roles in the central nervous system. A regioselective disulfide-bond synthesis protocol was developed and used for the chemical synthesis of human (H3) relaxin-3. The selectively S-protected A and B chains were combined by stepwise formation of each of the three insulin-like disulfides via aeration, thioloysis, and iodolysis. Judicious positioning of the three sets of S-protecting groups was crucial for acquisition of synthetic H3 relaxin in a good overall yield. The activity of the peptide was tested against relaxin family peptide receptors. Although the highest activity was demonstrated on the human relaxin-3 receptor (GPCR135), the peptide also showed high activity on relaxin receptors (LGR7) from various species and variable activity on the INSL3 receptor (LGR8). Recombinant mouse prorelaxin-3 demonstrated similar activity to H3 relaxin, suggesting that the presence of the C peptide did not influence the conformation of the active site. H3 relaxin was also able to activate native LGR7 receptors. It stimulated increased MMP-2 expression in LGR7-expressing rat ventricular fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner and, following infusion into the lateral ventricle of the brain, stimulated water drinking in rats, activating LGR7 receptors located in the subfornical organ. Thus, H3 relaxin is able to interact with the relaxin receptor LGR7 both in vitro and in vivo.",,
15465925,"Relaxin-3/insulin-like peptide 5 chimeric peptide, a selective ligand for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)135 and GPCR142 over leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 7.","Relaxin-3, the most recently identified member of relaxin/insulin family, is an agonist for leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor (LGR)7, GPCR135, and GPCR142. LGR7 can be pharmacologically differentiated from GPCR135 and GPCR142 by its high affinity for relaxin. Selective ligands that specifically activate GPCR135 or GPCR142 are highly desirable for studying their functional roles. We have created chimeric peptides that consist of the B-chain of human relaxin-3 in combination with various A-chains from other members of the relaxin/insulin family. Pharmacological characterization of these chimeric peptides indicates the A-chain from relaxin-1, relaxin-2, insulin-like peptide (INSL)3, and INSL6 does not change the pharmacological properties of relaxin-3 significantly. In contrast, substitution of the relaxin-3 A-chain with the A-chain from INSL5 results in a chimeric peptide that selectively activates GPCR135 and GPCR142 over LGR7. This study demonstrates that the A-chains among some of the insulin/relaxin family members are pharmacologically exchangeable. The relaxin-3/INSL5 chimeric peptide is a potential tool to study in vivo function of GPCR135. In addition, because of the substitution of a very hydrophobic peptide (the A-chain of relaxin-3) with a very hydrophilic peptide (the A-chain from INSL5), the radiolabeled (125)I-relaxin-3/INSL5 chimera is a suitable ligand (high-affinity, low-nonspecific binding) for receptor autoradiographic studies on tissue sections.",Molecular pharmacology,2005
16354665,Release of the soluble transferrin receptor is directly regulated by binding of its ligand ferritransferrin.,"The human transferrin receptor (TfR) is shed by an integral metalloprotease releasing a soluble form (sTfR) into serum. The sTfR reflects the iron demand of the body and is postulated as a regulator of iron homeostasis via binding to the hereditary hemochromatosis protein HFE. To study the role of transferrin in this process, we investigated TfR shedding in HL60 cells and TfR-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human TfR. Independent of TfR expression, sTfR release decreases with increasing ferritransferrin concentrations, whereas apo-transferrin exhibits no inhibitory effect. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we generated several TfR mutants with different binding affinities for transferrin. Shedding of TfR mutants in transfected cells correlates exactly with their binding affinity, implying that the effect of ferritransferrin on TfR shedding is mediated by a direct molecular interaction. Analysis of sTfR release from purified microsomal membranes revealed that the regulation is independent from intracellular trafficking or cellular signaling events. Our results clearly demonstrated that sTfR does not only reflect the iron demand of the cells but also the iron availability in the bloodstream, mirrored by iron saturation of transferrin, corroborating the important potential function of sTfR as a regulator of iron homeostasis.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2006
15107857,Repelling class discrimination: ephrin-A5 binds to and activates EphB2 receptor signaling.,"The interactions between Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands regulate cell migration and axon pathfinding. The EphA receptors are generally thought to become activated by ephrin-A ligands, whereas the EphB receptors interact with ephrin-B ligands. Here we show that two of the most widely studied of these molecules, EphB2 and ephrin-A5, which have never been described to interact with each other, do in fact bind one another with high affinity. Exposure of EphB2-expressing cells to ephrin-A5 leads to receptor clustering, autophosphorylation and initiation of downstream signaling. Ephrin-A5 induces EphB2-mediated growth cone collapse and neurite retraction in a model system. We further show, using X-ray crystallography, that the ephrin-A5-EphB2 complex is a heterodimer and is architecturally distinct from the tetrameric EphB2-ephrin-B2 structure. The structural data reveal the molecular basis for EphB2-ephrin-A5 signaling and provide a framework for understanding the complexities of functional interactions and crosstalk between A- and B-subclass Eph receptors and ephrins.",,
8849681,Replacement of Gln280 by His in TM6 of the human ORL1 receptor increases affinity but reduces intrinsic activity of opioids.,"The ORL1 (Opioid Receptor-Like) receptor is the G protein-coupled receptor whose amino acid sequence is closest to those of opioid receptors. Residues that are conserved in ORL1 and the three types of opioid receptor, but also a residue, His in the sixth putative transmembrane (TM6) helix, which is present in all opioid receptor types but absent in ORL1, appear to play a key role in receptor recognition and/or activation. Here we have sought to create an opioid binding pocket in the non-opioid ORL1 receptor by replacing residue Gln280 in its TM6 by the corresponding His residue of opioid receptors. The mutation affects neither the affinity of nociceptin - the natural ORL1 agonist - for the receptor, nor the potency of nociceptin to inhibit adenylyl cyclase via ORL1. In contrast, we find that a few opioid ligands, the agonists lofentanil, etorphine and dynorphin A, and especially the antagonists diprenorphine and nor-BNI, bind the mutant Q280H receptor with substantially (5- to > 100-fold) higher apparent affinity than they do the wild-type receptor. Moreover, lofentanil and etorphine no longer act as pure agonists, as they do at the native ORL1 receptor, but are endowed with clear antagonist properties at the mutant receptor. The mutation Q280H, which increases affinity while decreasing intrinsic activity of opioids at ORL1, emphasizes the importance of the His residue for opioid recognition and activation.",,
10748135,Replacement of the transmembrane anchor in angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol tail affects activation of the B2 bradykinin receptor by ACE inhibitors.,"To investigate further the relationship of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to activation of the B(2) bradykinin (BK) receptor, we transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells to stably express the human receptor and either wild-type ACE (WT-ACE), an ACE construct with most of the cytosolic portion deleted (Cyt-del-ACE), or ACE with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor replacing the transmembrane and cytosolic domains (GPI-ACE). BK or its ACE-resistant analogue were the agonists. All activities (arachidonic acid release and calcium mobilization) were blocked by the B(2) antagonist HOE 140. B(2) was desensitized by repeated administration of BK but resensitized to agonist by ACE inhibitors in the cells expressing both B(2) and either WT-ACE or Cyt-del-ACE. In GPI-ACE expressing cells, the B(2) receptor was still activated by the agonists, but ACE inhibitors did not resensitize. Pretreatment with filipin returned the sensitivity to inhibitors. In immunocytochemistry, GPI-ACE showed patchy, uneven distribution on the plasma membrane that was restored by filipin. Thus, ACE inhibitors were inactive as long as GPI-ACE was sequestered in cholesterol-rich membrane domains. WT-ACE and B(2) receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells co-immunoprecipitated with antibody to receptor, suggesting an interaction on the cell membrane. ACE inhibitors augment BK effects on receptors indirectly only when enzyme and receptor molecules are sterically close, possibly forming a heterodimer.",,
15456815,Repulsion and attraction of axons by semaphorin3D are mediated by different neuropilins in vivo.,"Class 3 semaphorins are known to repel and/or sometimes attract axons; however, their role in guiding developing axons in the CNS in vivo is still essentially unknown. We investigated the role of Semaphorin3D (Sema3D) in the formation of the early axon pathways in the zebrafish CNS. Morpholino knock-down shows that Sema3D is essential for the correct formation of two early axon pathways. Sema3D appears to guide axons of the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (nucMLF) by repulsion and modulation of fasciculation. In contrast, Sema3D appears to be attractive to telencephalic neurons that form the anterior commissure (AC). Knock-down of Neuropilin-1A (Npn-1A) phenocopied the effects of Sema3D knock-down on the nucMLF axons, and knock-down of either Npn-1A or Npn-2B phenocopied the defects of the AC. Furthermore, simultaneous partial knock-down experiments demonstrated genetic interactions among Sema3D, Npn-1A, and Npn-2B. Together, these data support the hypothesis that Sema3D may act as a repellent through receptors containing Npn-1A and as an attractant via receptors containing Npn-1A and Npn-2B.",,
19741192,Repulsive axon guidance molecule Slit3 is a novel angiogenic factor.,"Slits are large, secreted repulsive axon guidance molecules. Recent genetic studies revealed that the Slit3 is dispensable for neural development but required for non-neuron-related developmental processes, such as the genesis of the diaphragm and kidney. Here we report that Slit3 potently promotes angiogenesis, a process essential for proper organogenesis during embryonic development. We observed that Slit3 is expressed and secreted by both endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells in vasculature and that the Slit cognate receptors Robo1 and Robo4 are universally expressed by endothelial cells, suggesting that Slit3 may act in paracrine and autocrine manners to regulate endothelial cells. Cellular function studies revealed that Slit3 stimulates endothelial-cell proliferation, promotes endothelial-cell motility and chemotaxis via interaction with Robo4, and accelerates endothelial-cell vascular network formation in vitro with a specific activity comparable with vascular endothelial growth factor. Furthermore, Slit3 stimulates neovessel sprouting ex vivo and new blood vessel growth in vivo. Consistent with these observations, the Slit3 knockout mice display disrupted angiogenesis during embryogenesis. Taken together, our studies reveal that the repulsive axon guidance molecule Slit3 is a novel and potent angiogenic factor and functions to promote angiogenesis in coordinating organogenesis during embryonic development.",,
23029472,Repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family proteins exhibit differential binding kinetics for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily that exert their effects via type I and type II serine threonine kinase receptors and the SMAD intracellular signaling pathway to regulate diverse biologic processes. Recently, we discovered that the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family, including RGMA, RGMB, and RGMC/hemojuvelin (HJV), function as co-receptors that enhance cellular responses to BMP ligands. Here, we use surface plasmon resonance to quantitate the binding kinetics of RGM proteins for BMP ligands. We show that among the RGMs, HJV exhibits the highest affinity for BMP6, BMP5, and BMP7 with K(D) 8.1, 17, and 20 nM respectively, versus 28, 33, and 166 nM for RGMB, and 55, 83, and 63 nM for RGMA. Conversely, RGMB exhibits preferential binding to BMP4 and BMP2 with K(D) 2.6 and 5.5 nM respectively, versus 4.5 and 9.4 nM for HJV, and 14 and 22 nM for RGMA, while RGMA exhibits the lowest binding affinity for most BMPs tested. Among the BMP ligands, RGMs exhibit the highest relative affinity for BMP4 and the lowest relative affinity for BMP7, while none of the RGMs bind to BMP9. Thus, RGMs exhibit preferential binding for distinct subsets of BMP ligands. The preferential binding of HJV for BMP6 is consistent with the functional role of HJV and BMP6 in regulating systemic iron homeostasis. Our data may help explain the mechanism by which BMPs exert cell-context specific effects via a limited number of type I and type II receptors.",,
11162621,Requirement of intact disulfide bonds in orexin-A-induced stimulation of gastric acid secretion that is mediated by OX1 receptor activation.,"Orexin-A is a neuropeptide consisting of 33 amino acids with two intrachain disulfide bonds, namely Cys6-Cys12 and Cys7-Cys14, and is a potent stimulator of food consumption and gastric acid secretion. In contrast, orexin-B, a peptide containing 28 amino acids without disulfide bond, which has no stimulatory action of gastric acid. The objective of the present study was to characterize the receptor-mediated mechanism of orexin-A-induced stimulation of gastric acid secretion using orexin-A-related peptides with modification of disulfide bonds. Intracisternal injection of orexin-A, but not orexin-B or orexin-A (15-33), that does not contain both disulfide bonds stimulated gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated conscious rats. The ability of the stimulation of gastric acid output was less in three alanine-substituted orexin-A, [Ala(6,12)]orexin-A, [Ala(7,14)]orexin-A, and [Ala(6,7,12,14)]orexin-A, than orexin-A. Orexins-induced calcium increase was measured in CHO-K1 cells expressing OX1R or OX2R. Orexin-A induced a transient increase in [Ca(2+)]i in CHO-K1/OX1R cells in a dose-dependent manner. EC50 values for OX1R of orexin-A, orexin-B, or orexin-A (15-33) was 0.068, 0.69 or 4.1 nM, respectively, suggesting that peptides containing no disulfide bonds have lower potency for the receptor. Agonistic activity for OX1R of the three orexin-A analogues with modification of one or both disulfide bonds was significantly reduced as compared with that of orexin-A. EC50 values for OX2R of orexin-A and orexin-B was almost equal but potency for the receptor of orexin-A (15-33) and three alanine substituted orexin-A was less than that of orexin-A. A significant inverse relationship between gastric acid output and EC50 values for OX1R, but not OX2R, was observed. These results suggested that the orexin-A-induced acid stimulation requires OX1R activation and that disulfide bonds in orexin-A may have a key role in the receptor activation.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2001
8980224,"Requisite role of angiopoietin-1, a ligand for the TIE2 receptor, during embryonic angiogenesis.","Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which acts via members of a family of endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine kinases, is the only factor that has been shown definitively to play a role in the formation of the embryonic vasculature. Only one other family of receptor tyrosine kinases, comprising TIE1 and TIE2, is largely endothelial cell specific. We have recently cloned a ligand for TIE2, termed Angiopoietin-1. Here we show that mice engineered to lack Angiopoietin-1 display angiogenic deficits reminiscent of those previously seen in mice lacking TIE2, demonstrating that Angiopoietin-1 is a primary physiologic ligand for TIE2 and that it has critical in vivo angiogenic actions that are distinct from VEGF and that are not reflected in the classic in vitro assays used to characterize VEGF. Angiopoietin-1 seems to play a crucial role in mediating reciprocal interactions between the endothelium and surrounding matrix and mesenchyme.",Cell,1996
9553099,Residues 21-30 within the extracellular N-terminal region of the C5a receptor represent a binding domain for the C5a anaphylatoxin.,"The functions of the C5a anaphylatoxin are expressed through its interaction with a cell-surface receptor with seven transmembrane helices. The interaction of C5a with the receptor has been explained by a two-site model whereby recognition and effector sites on C5a bind, respectively, to recognition and effector domains on the receptor, leading to receptor activation (Chenoweth, D. E., and Hugli, T. E. (1980) Mol. Immunol. 17, 151-161. In addition, the extracellular N-terminal region of the C5a receptor has been implicated as the recognition domain for C5a, responsible for approximately 50% of the binding energy of the C5a-receptor complex (Mery, L., and Boulay, F. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 3457-3463; DeMartino, J. A., Van Riper, G., Siciliano, S. J., Molineaux, C. J., Konteatis, Z. D., Rosen, H., and Springer, M. S. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 14446-14450). In this work, the interactions of C5a with the N-terminal domain of the C5a receptor were examined by use of recombinant human C5a molecules and peptide fragments M1NSFN5YTTPD10YGHYD15DKDTL20DLNTP25VDKTS30NTLR(hC5aRF-1-34), acetyl-HYD15DKDTL20DLNTP25VDKTS30NTLR (hC5aRF-13-34), and acetyl-TL20DLNTP25VDKTS30N-amide (hC5aRF-19-31) derived from human C5a receptor. Binding induced resonance perturbations in the NMR spectra of the receptor fragments and the C5a molecules indicated that the isolated Nterminal domain or residues 1-34 of the C5a receptor retain specific binding to C5a and to a C5a analog devoid of the agonistic C-terminal tail in the intact C5a. Residues of C5a perturbed by the binding of the receptor peptides are localized within the helical core of the C5a structure, in agreement with the results from functional studies employing mutated C5a and intact receptor molecules. All three receptor peptides, hC5aRF-1-34, hC5aRF-13-34, and hC5aRF-19-31, responded to the binding of C5a through the 21-30 region containing either hydrophobic, polar, or positively charged residues such as Thr24, Pro25, Val26, Lys28, Thr29, and Ser30. The 21-30 segment of all three receptor fragments was found to have a partially folded conformation in solution, independent of residues 1-18. These results indicate that a short peptide sequence, or residues 21-30, of the C5a receptor N terminus may constitute the binding domain for the recognition site on C5a.",,
12522212,Residues Phe342-Asn346 of activated coagulation factor IX contribute to the interaction with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein.,"When blood coagulation factor IX is converted to activated factor IX (factor IXa), it develops enzymatic activity and exposes the binding sites for both activated factor VIII and the endocytic receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). In the present study we investigated the interaction between factor IXa and LRP in more detail, using an affinity-purified soluble form of LRP (sLRP). Purified sLRP and full-length LRP displayed similar binding to factor IXa. An anti-factor IX monoclonal antibody CLB-FIX 13 inhibited factor IXa.sLRP complex formation. Both the antibody and a soluble recombinant fragment of LRP (i.e. cluster IV) interfered with factor IXa amidolytic activity, suggesting that the antibody and LRP share similar binding regions near the active site of factor IXa. Next, a panel of recombinant factor IXa variants with amino acid replacements in the surface loops bordering the active site was tested for binding to antibody CLB-FIX 13 and sLRP in a solid phase binding assay. Factor IXa variants with mutations in the region Phe(342)-Asn(346), located between the active site of factor IXa and factor VIII binding helix, showed reduced binding to both antibody CLB-FIX 13 and sLRP. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the variant with Asn(346) replaced by Asp displayed slower association to sLRP, whereas the variant with residues Phe(342)-Tyr(345) replaced by the corresponding residues of thrombin showed faster dissociation. Recombinant soluble LRP fragment cluster IV inhibited factor IXa-mediated activation of factor X with IC(50) values of 5 and 40 nm in the presence and absence of factor VIII, respectively. This inhibition thus seems to occur via two mechanisms: by interference with factor IXa.factor VIIIa complex assembly and by direct inhibition of factor IXa enzymatic activity. Accordingly, we propose that LRP may function as a regulator of blood coagulation.",,
19754671,Resistin competes with lipopolysaccharide for binding to toll-like receptor 4.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of cellular structures activated by recognition of pathogen associated molecular sequences. The activation of TLRs triggers a variety of intracellular mechanisms aiming to protect the host from the invading microorganisms. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main ligand for TLR4. Here we show that resistin, a cystein-rich protein believed to regulate carbohydrate metabolism, competes with LPS for binding to TLR4. Binding of recombinant resistin to human myeloid and epithelial cells was assessed by flow cytometry and its co-precipitation with TLR4 was demonstrated. Antibodies against TLR4 abolished resistin binding to human leucocytes and cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to resistin stimulation. In contrast, isotype-matched murine IgG or TLR2 antibodies were unable to prevent binding of resistin to the cells. Similarly, TLR4-dependent pattern of resistin binding was observed in epithelial cell line HEK293 (human epithelial kidney cell), where TLR4 transfected, but not myeloid differentiation factor 2/CD14-transfected, TLR2 transfected or HEKnull cells, responded functionally to resistin stimulation. Intracellular signalling of resistin was assessed using inhibitors of transcription factors mitogen activated protein kinases, nuclear factor-kappaB, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and siRNA targeting TLR4 and human myeloid differentiation factor 88. Results demonstrate that TLR4 serves as a receptor for the pro-inflammatory effects of resistin in human cells. This may partly explain the multifunctional role of resistin in chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis and insulin resistance.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2010
15705594,Restoration of Wnt-7a expression reverses non-small cell lung cancer cellular transformation through frizzled-9-mediated growth inhibition and promotion of cell differentiation.,"The Wnt signaling pathway is critical in normal development, and mutation of specific components is frequently observed in carcinomas of diverse origins. However, the potential involvement of this pathway in lung tumorigenesis has not been established. In this study, analysis of multiple Wnt mRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and primary lung tumors revealed markedly decreased Wnt-7a expression compared with normal short-term bronchial epithelial cell lines and normal uninvolved lung tissue. Wnt-7a transfection in NSCLC cell lines reversed cellular transformation, decreased anchorage-independent growth, and induced epithelial differentiation as demonstrated by soft agar and three-dimensional cell culture assays in a subset of the NSCLC cell lines. The action of Wnt-7a correlated with expression of the specific Wnt receptor Frizzled-9 (Fzd-9), and transfection of Fzd-9 into a Wnt-7a-insensitive NSCLC cell line established Wnt-7a sensitivity. Moreover, Wnt-7a was present in Fzd-9 immunoprecipitates, indicating a direct interaction of Wnt-7a and Fzd-9. In NSCLC cells, Wnt-7a and Fzd-9 induced both cadherin and Sprouty-4 expression and stimulated the JNK pathway, but not beta-catenin/T cell factor activity. In addition, transfection of gain-of-function JNK strongly inhibited anchorage-independent growth. Thus, this study demonstrates that Wnt-7a and Fzd-9 signaling through activation of the JNK pathway induces cadherin proteins and the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sprouty-4 and represents a novel tumor suppressor pathway in lung cancer that is required for maintenance of epithelial differentiation and inhibition of transformed cell growth in a subset of human NSCLCs.",,
10894171,Retinoic acid early inducible genes define a ligand family for the activating NKG2D receptor in mice.,"Here we describe a family of GPI-anchored cell surface proteins that function as ligands for the mouse activating NKG2D receptor. These molecules are encoded by the retinoic acid early inducible (RAE-1) and H60 minor histocompatibility antigen genes on mouse chromosome 10 and show weak homology with MHC class I. Expression of the NKG2D ligands is low or absent on normal, adult tissues; however, they are constitutively expressed on some tumors and upregulated by retinoic acid.

23959802,Retinol-binding protein 4 and its membrane receptor STRA6 control adipogenesis by regulating cellular retinoid homeostasis and retinoic acid receptor α activity.,"Retinoids are vitamin A (retinol) derivatives and complex regulators of adipogenesis by activating specific nuclear receptors, including the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). Circulating retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and its membrane receptor STRA6 coordinate cellular retinol uptake. It is unknown whether retinol levels and the activity of RAR and RXR in adipocyte precursors are linked via RBP4/STRA6. Here, we show that STRA6 is expressed in precursor cells and, dictated by the apo- and holo-RBP4 isoforms, mediates bidirectional retinol transport that controls RARα activity and subsequent adipocyte differentiation. Mobilization of retinoid stores in mice by inducing RBP4 secretion from the liver activated RARα signaling in the precursor cell containing the stromal-vascular fraction of adipose tissue. Retinol-loaded holo-RBP4 blocked adipocyte differentiation of cultured precursors by activating RARα. Remarkably, retinol-free apo-RBP4 triggered retinol efflux that reduced cellular retinoids, RARα activity, and target gene expression and enhanced adipogenesis synergistically with ectopic STRA6. Thus, STRA6 in adipocyte precursor cells links nuclear RARα activity to the circulating RBP4 isoforms, whose ratio in obese mice was shifted toward limiting the adipogenic potential of their precursors. This novel cross talk identifies a retinol-dependent metabolic function of RBP4 that may have important implications for the treatment of obesity.",,
11696542,RETRACTED: Factor XI binding to the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex promotes factor XI activation by thrombin.,"Factor XI binds to high affinity sites on the surface of stimulated platelets where it is efficiently activated by thrombin. Here, we provide evidence that the factor XI binding site on platelets is in the glycoprotein (GP) Ibalpha subunit of the GP Ib-IX-V complex as follows. 1) Bernard-Soulier platelets, lacking the complex, are deficient in factor XI binding; 2) two GP Ibalpha ligands, SZ-2 (a monoclonal antibody) and bovine von Willebrand factor, inhibit factor XI binding to platelets; 3) by surface plasmon resonance, factor XI bound specifically to glycocalicin (the extracellular domain of GP Ibalpha) in Zn(2+)-dependent fashion (K(d)( app) approximately 52 nm). We then investigated whether glycocalicin could promote factor XI activation by thrombin, another GP Ibalpha ligand. In the presence of high molecular weight kininogen (45 nm), Zn(2+) and Ca(2+) ions, thrombin activated factor XI in the presence of glycocalicin at rates comparable with those seen in the presence of dextran sulfate (1 microg/ml). With higher high molecular weight kininogen concentrations (360 nm), the rate of thrombin-catalyzed factor XI activation in the presence of glycocalicin was comparable with that on activated platelets. Thus, factor XI binds to the GP Ib-IX-V complex, promoting its activation by thrombin.",,
11353828,Reversibly locking a protein fold in an active conformation with a disulfide bond: integrin alphaL I domains with high affinity and antagonist activity in vivo.,"The integrin alphaLbeta2 has three different domains in its headpiece that have been suggested to either bind ligand or to regulate ligand binding. One of these, the inserted or I domain, has a fold similar to that of small G proteins. The I domain of the alphaM and alpha2 subunits has been crystallized in both open and closed conformations; however, the alphaL I domain has been crystallized in only the closed conformation. We hypothesized that the alphaL domain also would have an open conformation, and that this would be the ligand binding conformation. Therefore, we introduced pairs of cysteine residues to form disulfides that would lock the alphaL I domain in either the open or closed conformation. Locking the I domain open resulted in a 9,000-fold increase in affinity to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which was reversed by disulfide reduction. By contrast, the affinity of the locked closed conformer was similar to wild type. Binding completely depended on Mg(2+). Orders of affinity were ICAM-1 > ICAM-2 > ICAM-3. The k(on), k(off), and K(D) values for the locked open I domain were within 1.5-fold of values previously determined for the alphaLbeta2 complex, showing that the I domain is sufficient for full affinity binding to ICAM-1. The locked open I domain antagonized alphaLbeta2-dependent adhesion in vitro, lymphocyte homing in vivo, and firm adhesion but not rolling on high endothelial venules. The ability to reversibly lock a protein fold in an active conformation with dramatically increased affinity opens vistas in therapeutics and proteomics.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2001
10944520,RGD-independent binding of integrin alpha9beta1 to the ADAM-12 and -15 disintegrin domains mediates cell-cell interaction.,"ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteases) mediate several important processes (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha release, fertilization, and myoblast fusion). The ADAM disintegrin domains generally lack RGD motifs, and their receptors are virtually unknown. Here we show that integrin alpha(9)beta(1) specifically interacts with the recombinant ADAMs-12 and -15 disintegrin domains in an RGD-independent manner. We also show that interaction between ADAM-12 or -15 and alpha(9)beta(1) supports cell-cell interaction. Interestingly, the cation requirement and integrin activation status required for alpha(9)beta(1)/ADAM-mediated cell adhesion and cell-cell interaction is similar to those required for known integrin-extracellular matrix interaction. These results are quite different from recent reports that ADAM-2/alpha(6)beta(1) interaction during sperm/egg fusion requires an integrin activation status distinct from that for extracellular matrix interaction. These results suggest that alpha(9)beta(1) may be a major receptor for ADAMs that lack RGD motifs, and that, considering a wide distribution of ADAMs and alpha(9)beta(1), this interaction may be of potential biological and pathological significance.",,
19944164,RGMb controls aggregation and migration of Neogenin-positive cells in vitro and in vivo.,"The proliferation, migration and differentiation of dentate gyrus stem and precursor cells have aroused keen interest. Neogenin and RGMb are expressed in non-overlapping compartments of the developing dentate gyrus. While Neogenin is expressed in migrating and proliferating dentate precursors, RGMb is localized in structures bordering the developing dentate, such as cornus ammonis cells and Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone including the hippocampal fissure. Co-immunoprecipitation and binding assays indicate a strong physical interaction. In vitro and in vivo migration of dentate neuroepithelial cells is abolished by RGMb, and cell adhesion is reduced when cells expressing Neogenin comes into contact with cells expressing RGMb. Ectopic expression of RGMb in organotypic slice cultures and after in utero electroporation in the hippocampus modifies precursor cell migration. Our results imply that Neogenin-RGMb interaction might be involved in neuronal migration in the dentate gyrus.",Molecular and cellular neurosciences,2010
24752301,RGMb is a novel binding partner for PD-L2 and its engagement with PD-L2 promotes respiratory tolerance.,"We report that programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2), a known ligand of PD-1, also binds to repulsive guidance molecule b (RGMb), which was originally identified in the nervous system as a co-receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). PD-L2 and BMP-2/4 bind to distinct sites on RGMb. Normal resting lung interstitial macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells express high levels of RGMb mRNA, whereas lung dendritic cells express PD-L2. Blockade of the RGMb-PD-L2 interaction markedly impaired the development of respiratory tolerance by interfering with the initial T cell expansion required for respiratory tolerance. Experiments with PD-L2-deficient mice showed that PD-L2 expression on non-T cells was critical for respiratory tolerance, but expression on T cells was not required. Because PD-L2 binds to both PD-1, which inhibits antitumor immunity, and to RGMb, which regulates respiratory immunity, targeting the PD-L2 pathway has therapeutic potential for asthma, cancer, and other immune-mediated disorders. Understanding this pathway may provide insights into how to optimally modulate the PD-1 pathway in cancer immunotherapy while minimizing adverse events.",The Journal of experimental medicine,2014

The neurite outgrowth response was inhibited by an antibody raised against the first Ig domain of Robo1/2 or by soluble Robo-Fc chimera. Furthermore, we show that the extracellular domains of Robo1 and Robo2 are homophilic adhesion molecules that can also interact with each other. These data suggest a wider range of functions for the Robo family in the development of the nervous system and provide novel insights into the molecular basis for the phenotypes observed in Robo mutants in Drosophila, C. elegans, and zebrafish.",Molecular and cellular neurosciences,2002

Perturbation of actin filaments by either cytochalasin-D or conditional Cofilin expression resulted in decreased synaptic OXT levels. Genetic loss of ",,
11446740,Role of C chemokine lymphotactin in mediating recruitment of antigen-specific CD62L(lo) cells in vitro and in vivo.,"In this study we investigated whether T cells expressing high or low levels of CD62L were differentially susceptible to the T cell chemokine lymphotactin. We found that lymphotactin induced preferential migration of antigen-specific (CD62L(lo)) T cells over the nonspecific (CD62L(hi)) T cells in vitro and in vivo. The differing migratory abilities correlated with higher levels of mRNA encoding the lymphotactin receptor (XCR1) on the CD62L(lo) cells compared to the CD62L(hi) cells. Thus, we have identified a coupling mechanism between the activation of T cells and acquisition of new homing properties, in this case conferred by XCR1 expression. These data confirm that at least one function of lymphotactin includes mediating the recruitment of recently activated antigen-specific T cells.",,
19887479,Role of class 3 semaphorins and their receptors in tumor growth and angiogenesis.,"Class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3) were first identified as glycoproteins that negatively mediate neuronal guidance by binding to neuropilin and repelling neurons away from the source of SEMA3. However, studies have shown that SEMA3s are also secreted by other cell types, including tumor cells, where they play an inhibitory role in tumor growth and angiogenesis (specifically SEMA3B and SEMA3F). SEMA3s primarily inhibit the cell motility and migration of tumor and endothelial cells by inducing collapse of the actin cytoskeleton via neuropilins and plexins. Besides binding to SEMA3s, neuropilin also binds the protumorigenic and proangiogenic ligand vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Although some studies attribute the antitumorigenic and antiangiogenic properties of SEMA3s to competition between SEMA3s and VEGF for binding to neuropilin receptors, several others have shown that SEMA3s display growth-inhibitory activity independent of competition with VEGF. A better understanding of these molecular interactions and the role and signaling of SEMA3s in tumor biology will help determine whether SEMA3s represent potential therapeutic agents. Herein, we briefly review (a) the role of SEMA3s in mediating tumor growth, (b) the SEMA3 receptors neuropilins and plexins, and (c) the potential competition between SEMA3s and VEGF family members for neuropilin binding.",,

10862746,Role of frizzled 7 in the regulation of convergent extension movements during gastrulation in Xenopus laevis.,"Wnt signalling plays a crucial role in the control of morphogenetic movements. We describe the expression and functional analyses of frizzled 7 (Xfz7) during gastrulation in Xenopus. Low levels of Xfz7 transcripts are expressed maternally during cleavage stages; its zygotic expression strongly increases at the beginning of gastrulation and is predominantly localized to the presumptive neuroectoderm and deep cells of the involuting mesoderm. Overexpression of Xfz7 in the dorsal equatorial region affects the movements of convergent extension and delays mesodermal involution. It alters the correct localization, but not the expression, of mesodermal and neural markers. These effects can be rescued by extra-Xfz7, which is a secreted form of the receptor that also weakly inhibits convergent extension when overexpressed. This suggests that the wild-type and truncated receptors have opposing effects when coexpressed and that overexpression of Xfz7 causes an increased signalling activity. Consistent with this, Xfz7 biochemically and functionally interacts with Xwnt11. In addition, Dishevelled, but not (&bgr;)-catenin, synergizes with Xfz7 to affect convergent extension. Furthermore, overexpression of Xfz7 and Xwnt11 also affects convergent extension in activin-treated animal caps, and this can be efficiently reversed by coexpression of Cdc42(T17N), a dominant negative mutant of the small GTPase Cdc42 known as a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton. Conversely, Cdc42(G12V), a constitutively active mutant, rescues the effects of extra-Xfz7 on convergent extension in a dose-dependent manner. That both gain-of-function and loss-of-function of both frizzled and dishevelled produce the same phenotype has been well described in Drosophila tissue polarity. Therefore, our results suggest an endogenous role of Xfz7 in the regulation of convergent extension during gastrulation.",,
1372909,Role of integrin alpha 4 beta 7/alpha 4 beta P in lymphocyte adherence to fibronectin and VCAM-1 and in homotypic cell clustering.,"Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface proteins that mediate both cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. We and others recently identified cDNAs encoding a novel integrin beta subunit, beta 7, in lymphocytes. We have now detected beta 7 mRNA in mouse TK-1 T lymphoma cells, which are known to express the putative Peyer's patch homing receptor alpha 4 beta P. We used an anti-peptide antiserum and a novel mAb against the beta 7 subunit to show that TK-1 cells express beta 7 as the only subunit associated with alpha 4. We conclude that beta 7 and beta P are identical. We also show that activated peripheral blood T cells express alpha 4 beta 7. We studied the function of alpha 4 beta 7/alpha 4 beta P in TK-1 cells, which do not express very late antigen (VLA)-4 (alpha 4 beta 1). Cells adhered to intact fibronectin and to a fibronectin fragment containing the CS-1 region, but not to a fragment containing the RGD sequence. Adhesion to fibronectin was inhibited by antibodies to alpha 4, suggesting that alpha 4 beta 7 is a fibronectin receptor. We confirmed that alpha 4 beta 7 binds to the CS-1 region of fibronectin using affinity chromatography. TK-1 cell adhesion to the vascular cell adhesion molecule VCAM-1 was also inhibited by antibodies to alpha 4, implying that alpha 4 beta 7 also plays a role in the adherence of lymphocytes to endothelial cells. TK-1 cell binding to fibronectin and VCAM-1 is markedly increased by brief PMA stimulation. We also found that mAbs against alpha 4 and beta 7 induce homotypic clustering of TK-1 cells. Taken together these results suggest that alpha 4 beta 7/alpha 4 beta P recognizes some or all of the same widely distributed ligands recognized by VLA-4 (alpha 4 beta 1) and that the role of alpha 4 beta 7/alpha 4 beta P may not be restricted to lymphocyte homing.",,
9045873,"Role of macrophage-stimulating protein and its receptor, RON tyrosine kinase, in ciliary motility.","Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) is an 80-kD serum protein with homology to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Its receptor, RON tyrosine kinase, is a new member of the HGF receptor family. The MSP-RON signaling pathway has been implicated in the functional regulation of mononuclear phagocytes. However, the function of this pathway in other types of cells has not been elucidated. Here we show that in contrast to the HGF receptor, which was expressed at the basolateral surface, RON was localized at the apical surface of ciliated epithelia in the airways and oviduct. In addition, MSP was found in the bronchoalveolar space at biologically significant concentrations. MSP bound to RON on normal human bronchial epithelial cells with a high affinity (Kd = 0.5 nM) and induced autophosphorylation of RON. Activation of RON by MSP led to a significant increase in ciliary beat frequency of human nasal cilia. These findings indicate that the ciliated epithelium of the mucociliary transport apparatus is a novel target of MSP. Ciliary motility is critical for mucociliary transport. Our findings suggest that the MSP-RON signaling pathway is a novel regulatory system of mucociliary function and might be involved in the host defense and fertilization.",,
12477859,Role of the asialoglycoprotein receptor in binding and entry of hepatitis C virus structural proteins in cultured human hepatocytes.,"We used a baculovirus-based system to prepare structural proteins of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1a. Binding of this preparation to cultured human hepatic cells was both dose dependent and saturable. This binding was decreased by calcium depletion and was partially prevented by ligands of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R), thyroglobulin, asialothyroglobulin, and antibody against a peptide in the carbohydrate recognition domain of ASGP-R but not preimmune antibody. Uptake by hepatocytes was observed with both radiolabeled and dye-labeled HCV structural proteins. With hepatocytes expressing the hH1 subunit of the ASGP-R fused to green fluorescent protein, we could show by confocal microscopy that dye stain cointernalized with the fusion protein in an area surrounding the nucleus. Internalization was more efficient with a preparation containing p7 than with one that did not. The two preparations bound to transfected 3T3-L1 cells expressing either both (hH1 and hH2) subunits of the ASGP-R (3T3-22Z cells) or both hH1 and a functionally defective variant of hH2 (3T3-24X cells) but not to parental cells. Additionally, uptake of dye-labeled preparation containing p7 was observed with 3T3-22Z cells but not with 3T3-L1 or 3T3-24X cells or with the preparation lacking p7, suggesting that p7 regulates the internalization properties of HCV structural proteins. Our observations suggest that HCV structural proteins bind to and cointernalize with the ASGP-R in cultured human hepatocytes.",,
8120056,Role of the integrin alpha v beta 6 in cell attachment to fibronectin. Heterologous expression of intact and secreted forms of the receptor.,"The integrin alpha v beta 6 has been shown to be a fibronectin-binding protein. To determine whether the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of alpha v beta 6 are necessary for binding to fibronectin, a truncated, secreted form of the integrin lacking these domains was engineered and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Fibronectin affinity chromatography demonstrated that the secreted integrin, like its full-length counterpart, was capable of binding fibronectin. Monoclonal antibodies were made to secreted alpha v beta 6 and to beta 6-transfected NIH 3T3 cells. In experiments designed to determine whether alpha v beta 6 can mediate cell attachment to fibronectin, full-length human beta 6 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in the human colon carcinoma cell line SW480. beta 6-expressing cells were identified by alpha v beta 6-specific antibodies, and the beta 6-transfectants were used in cell-adhesion assays. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, human beta 6 associated with hamster alpha v but was incapable of mediating cell attachment to fibronectin. However, expression of beta 6 in these cells had the dominant negative effect of decreasing alpha v beta 5-dependent adhesion to vitronectin. In SW480 cells, beta 6 expression conferred the ability to bind to fibronectin even in the presence of inhibitory antibodies against beta 1 integrins. In such cells, fibronectin binding ability could be blocked by an antibody to alpha v integrins. These results constitute the first direct evidence that alpha v beta 6 mediates cell attachment to fibronectin.",,
12093292,Role of the N-terminus of epidermal growth factor in ErbB-2/ErbB-3 binding studied by phage display.,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds with high affinity to the EGF receptor, also known as ErbB-1, but upon replacement of the N-terminal linear region by neuregulin (NRG) 1 or transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha sequences it gains in addition high affinity for ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers. However, these chimeras weakly bind to ErbB-3 alone. To further dissect the ligand binding selectivity of the ErbB network, we have applied the phage display technique to examine the role of the linear N-terminal region in EGF for interaction with ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers. A library of EGF variants was constructed in which residues 2, 3, and 4 were randomly mutated, followed by selection for binding to intact MDA-MB-453 cells that overexpress ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 but lack ErbB-1. Analysis of the selected phage EGF variants revealed clones with high binding affinity to ErbB-2/ErbB-3 while maintaining high affinity to ErbB-1. In these variants, Trp (or alternatively His) was almost exclusively present at position 2, while specific combinations of hydrophobic, basic, and small residues were found at positions 3 and 4. The mitogenic activity of the phage EGF variants corresponded with their relative binding affinity. Two of the selected EGF variants, EGF/WVS and EGF/WRS, were further characterized as recombinant proteins. In contrast to previously characterized chimeras of EGF with NRG-1 or TGF-alpha, these variants did not only show high binding affinity for ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers but also for ErbB-3 alone. These data show that the linear N-terminal region of EGF-like growth factors is directly involved in binding to ErbB-3.",Biochemistry,2002
10632583,Role of tissue plasminogen activator receptor LRP in hippocampal long-term potentiation.,"The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP) is a multifunctional endocytic receptor that is expressed abundantly in neurons of the CNS. Both LRP and several of its ligands, including tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), apolipoprotein E/lipoproteins, alpha(2)-macroglobulin, and the beta-amyloid precursor protein, have been implicated in various neuronal functions and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. It has been reported that induction of tPA expression may contribute to activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In addition, long-term potentiation (LTP) is significantly decreased in mice lacking tPA. Here we demonstrate that tPA receptor LRP is abundantly expressed in hippocampal neurons and participates in hippocampal LTP. Perfusion of hippocampal slices with receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist for ligand interactions with LRP, significantly reduced late-phase LTP (L-LTP). In addition, RAP also blocked the enhancing effect of synaptic potentiation by exogenous tPA in hippocampal slices prepared from tPA knock-out mice. Metabolic labeling and ligand binding analyses showed that both tPA and LRP are synthesized by hippocampal neurons and that LRP is the major cell surface receptor that binds tPA. Finally, we found that tPA binding to LRP in hippocampal neurons enhances the activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, a key molecule that is known to be involved in L-LTP. Taken together, our results demonstrate that interactions between tPA and cell surface LRP are important for hippocampal L-LTP.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2000
12270937,Role of TRAF3 and -6 in the activation of the NF-kappa B and JNK pathways by X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor.,"X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR) is a recently isolated member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that has been shown to be highly expressed in ectodermal derivatives during embryonic development and binds to ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2). By using a subclone of 293F cells with stable expression of XEDAR, we report that XEDAR activates the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. Treatment with EDA-A2 leads to the recruitment of TRAF3 and -6 to the aggregated XEDAR complex, suggesting a central role of these adaptors in the proximal aspect of XEDAR signaling. Whereas TRAF3 and -6, IKK1/IKKalpha, IKK2/IKKbeta, and NEMO/IKKgamma are involved in XEDAR-induced NF-kappaB activation, XEDAR-induced JNK activation seems to be mediated via a pathway dependent on TRAF3, TRAF6, and ASK1. Deletion and point mutagenesis studies delineate two distinct regions in the cytoplasmic domain of XEDAR, which are involved in binding to TRAF3 and -6, respectively, and play a major role in the activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Taken together, our results establish a major role of TRAF3 and -6 in XEDAR signaling and in the process of ectodermal differentiation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002

Although constitutively expressed on most hematopoietic cells, CD48 is upregulated on subsets of activated cells. CD48 can have activating roles on T cells, antigen presenting cells and granulocytes, by binding to CD2 or bacterial FimH, and through cell intrinsic effects. Interactions between CD48 and its high affinity ligand CD244 are more complex, with both stimulatory and inhibitory outcomes. CD244:CD48 interactions regulate target cell lysis by NK cells and CTLs, which are important for viral clearance and regulation of effector/memory T cell generation and survival. Here we review roles of CD48 in infection, tolerance, autoimmunity, and allergy, as well as the tools used to investigate this receptor. We discuss stimulatory and regulatory roles for CD48, its potential as a therapeutic target in human disease, and current challenges to investigation of this immunoregulatory receptor.","Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",2016

The expression of chemokine receptors by intrinsic renal cells such as mesangial cells (MC) suggests an expanded role for chemokine-chemokine receptor biology in local immunomodulation and potentially glomerular homeostasis. By immunohistochemistry we found the chemokine receptor CCR7 expressed in a mesangial pattern while the CCR7 ligand SLC/CCL21 showed a podocyte-specific expression. CCR7 expression was further characterized by RT-PCR, RNase protection assays, and FACS analysis of cultured human MC, and was found to be constitutively present. Real-time PCR of microdissected glomeruli confirmed the expression of SLC/CCL21. A functional role for CCR7 was demonstrated for human MC migration and proliferation. A protective effect of SLC/CCL21 was shown for MC survival in Fas Ab-induced apoptosis. Finally, ""wound healing"" was enhanced in the presence of SLC/CCL21 in an in vitro injury model. The constitutive glomerular expression of CCR7 and its ligand SLC/CCL21 in adjacent cell types of the human kidney suggests novel biological functions of this chemokine/chemokine receptor pair and a potential role in processes involved in glomerular homeostasis and regeneration.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2002
8062829,RON is a heterodimeric tyrosine kinase receptor activated by the HGF homologue MSP.,"RON, a cDNA homologous to the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor gene (MET), encodes a putative tyrosine kinase. Here we show that the RON gene is expressed in several epithelial tissues as well as in granulocytes and monocytes. The major RON transcript is translated into a glycosylated single chain precursor, cleaved into a 185 kDa heterodimer (p185RON) of 35 (alpha) and 150 kDa (beta) disulfide-linked chains, before exposure at the cell surface. The Ron beta-chain displays intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity in vitro, after immunoprecipitation by specific antibodies. In vivo, tyrosine phosphorylation of p185RON is induced by stimulation with macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), a protease-like factor containing four 'kringle' domains, homologous to HGF. In epithelial cells, MSP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p185RON is followed by DNA synthesis. p185RON is not activated by HGF, nor is the HGF receptor activated by MSP in biochemical and biological assays. p185RON is also activated by a pure recombinant protein containing only the N-terminal two kringles of MSP. These data show that p185RON is a tyrosine kinase activated by MSP and that it is member of a family of growth factor receptors with distinct specificities for structurally related ligands.",,

9763566,RP105 is associated with MD-1 and transmits an activation signal in human B cells.,"RP105 was originally discovered as a mouse B-cell surface molecule that transmits an activation signal. The signal leads to resistance against irradiation-induced apoptosis and massive B-cell proliferation. Recently, we found that mouse RP105 is associated with another molecule, MD-1. We have isolated here the human MD-1 cDNA. We show that human MD-1 is also associated with human RP105 and has an important role in cell surface expression of RP105. We also describe a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that recognizes human RP105. Expression of RP105 is restricted to CD19(+) B cells. Histological studies showed that RP105 is expressed mainly on mature B cells in mantle zones. Germinal center cells are either dull or negative. RP105 is thus a novel human B-cell marker that is preferentially expressed on mature B cells. Moreover, the anti-RP105 MoAb activates B cells, leading to increases in cell size, expression of a costimulatory molecule CD80, and DNA synthesis. The B-cell activation pathway using RP105 is conserved in humans.",,

Despite growing biological importance, their mechanism of action is poorly understood. Here, we show that Rspo3 binds syndecan 4 (Sdc4) and that together they activate Wnt/PCP signaling. In Xenopus embryos, Sdc4 and Rspo3 are essential for two Wnt/PCP-driven processes-gastrulation movements and head cartilage morphogenesis. Rspo3/PCP signaling during gastrulation requires Wnt5a and is transduced via Fz7, Dvl, and JNK. Rspo3 functions by inducing Sdc4-dependent, clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We show that this internalization is essential for PCP signal transduction, suggesting that endocytosis of Wnt-receptor complexes is a key mechanism by which R-spondins promote Wnt signaling.",,
15598975,Ryk: another heretical Wnt receptor defies the canon.,"The number of proteins that serve as Wnt receptors is growing, and Ryk is one of the newest members of this group. Understanding how extracellular Wnt ligands interact with transmembrane receptors to activate intracellular signaling cascades is of broad importance to biology and to human disease because of the roles for Wnt in embryogenesis, cancer, and neural development and plasticity. The functions and properties of Ryk, a receptor tyrosine kinase-like protein, in canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling are beginning to be uncovered. Biochemical and genetic studies reveal that the extracellular regions of Ryk and Fz can form a mutual ligand-binding domain. It remains to be seen whether Ryk can form similar complexes with other Wnt-binding proteins. If divergent transmembrane proteins can combine interchangeably to form heteromeric Wnt receptor complexes, then a stunning diversity of signaling responses might be mediated through differential expression and localization of these proteins in target cells.",,
9881961,S19 ribosomal protein cross-linked dimer causes monocyte-predominant infiltration by means of molecular mimicry to complement C5a.,"S19 ribosomal protein is a component of the protein-producing machinery, ribosome. When recombinant S19 proteins were cross-linked intermolecularly by plasma transglutaminase (coagulation factor XIIIa), this homodimer newly exhibited monocyte chemotactic activity. This effect was specific to monocytes. The S19 protein homodimer shared the immunoreactivity with the complement-derived chemotactic factor, component 5a (C5a). Monocytes pretreated with an anti-C5a receptor antibody or with a synthetic C5a receptor antagonist responded poorly in chemotaxis to this homodimer. These data indicate that the S19 protein homodimer possesses a 3-dimensional structure similar to C5a in terms of the immunologic epitope and the receptor ligand, although homology between their primary structures is only 4%. In contrast, the S19 protein homodimer did not attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In addition, the homodimer inhibited a chemotactic response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to C5a in vitro and in vivo as a receptor antagonist. Furthermore, the S19 protein homodimer competitively inhibited the binding of radiolabeled C5a to polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The S19 protein homodimer with these opposite effects in the leukocyte chemotaxis seems to induce the monocyte/macrophage predominant infiltration in chronic inflammation.",,
27225731,SALM5 trans-synaptically interacts with LAR-RPTPs in a splicing-dependent manner to regulate synapse development.,"Synaptogenic adhesion molecules play critical roles in synapse formation. SALM5/Lrfn5, a SALM/Lrfn family adhesion molecule implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia, induces presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons, but its presynaptic ligand remains unknown. We found that SALM5 interacts with the Ig domains of LAR family receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs; LAR, PTPδ, and PTPσ). These interactions are strongly inhibited by the splice insert B in the Ig domain region of LAR-RPTPs, and mediate SALM5-dependent presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons. In addition, SALM5 regulates AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission through mechanisms involving the interaction of postsynaptic SALM5 with presynaptic LAR-RPTPs. These results suggest that postsynaptic SALM5 promotes synapse development by trans-synaptically interacting with presynaptic LAR-RPTPs and is important for the regulation of excitatory synaptic strength.",,
14716313,Saposin C is required for lipid presentation by human CD1b.,"Lipids from Mycobacterium tuberculosis are presented through CD1 proteins to T lymphocytes in humans, but the accessory molecules required for antigen loading and presentation remain unidentified. Here we show that fibroblasts deficient in sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs) transfected with CD1b failed to activate lipid-specific T cells. However, the T cell response was restored when fibroblasts were reconstituted with SAP-C but not other SAPs. Lipid antigen and SAP-C colocalized in lysosomal compartments, and liposome assays showed that SAP-C efficiently extracts antigen from membranes. Coprecipitation demonstrated direct molecular interaction between SAP-C and CD1b. We propose a model in which SAP-C exposes lipid antigens from intralysosomal membranes for loading onto CD1b. Thus, SAP-C represents a missing link in antigen presentation of lipids through CD1b to human T cells.",,

Orexin-A and orexin-B increased [Ca(2+)](i) in CHO-OX(1) (pEC(50)=8.38+/-0.04 and 7.26+/-0.05 respectively, n=12) and CHO-OX(2) (pEC(50)=8.20+/-0.03 and 8.26+/-0.04 respectively, n=8) cells. However, neuropeptide Y and secretin (10 pM - 10 microM) displayed neither agonist nor antagonist properties in either cell-line. SB-334867-A (1-(2-Methyylbenzoxanzol-6-yl)-3-[1,5]naphthyridin-4-yl-urea hydrochloride) inhibited the orexin-A (10 nM) and orexin-B (100 nM)-induced calcium responses (pK(B)=7.27+/-0.04 and 7.23+/-0.03 respectively, n=8), but had no effect on the UTP (3 microM)-induced calcium response in CHO-OX(1) cells. SB-334867-A (10 microM) also inhibited OX(2) mediated calcium responses (32.7+/-1.9% versus orexin-A). SB-334867-A was devoid of agonist properties in either cell-line. In conclusion, SB-334867-A is a non-peptide OX(1) selective receptor antagonist.",British journal of pharmacology,2001
1655405,Scatter factor and hepatocyte growth factor are indistinguishable ligands for the MET receptor.,"Scatter Factor (SF) is a fibroblast-secreted protein which promotes motility and matrix invasion of epithelial cells. Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) is a powerful mitogen for hepatocytes and other epithelial tissues. SF and HGF, purified according to their respective biological activities, were interchangeable and equally effective in assays for cell growth, motility and invasion. Both bound with identical affinities to the same sites in target cells. The receptor for SF and HGF was identified as the product of the MET oncogene by: (i) ligand binding and coprecipitation in immunocomplexes; (ii) chemical crosslinking to the Met beta subunit; (iii) transfer of binding activity in insect cells by a baculovirus carrying the MET cDNA; (iv) ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the Met beta subunit. SF and HGF cDNA clones from human fibroblasts, placenta and liver had virtually identical sequences. We conclude that the same molecule (SF/HGF) acts as a growth or motility factor through a single receptor in different target cells.",The EMBO journal,1991
11751872,Schwann cell adhesion to a novel heparan sulfate binding site in the N-terminal domain of alpha 4 type V collagen is mediated by syndecan-3.,"Previously we reported that type V collagen synthesized by Schwann cells inhibits the outgrowth of axons from rat embryo dorsal root ganglion neurons but promotes Schwann cell migration (Chernousov, M. A., Stahl, R. C., and Carey, D. J. (2001) J. Neurosci. 21, 6125-6135). Analysis of Schwann cell adhesion and spreading on dishes coated with various type V collagen domains revealed that Schwann cells adhered effectively only to the non-collagenous N-terminal domain (NTD) of the alpha4(V) collagen chain. Schwann cell adhesion to alpha4(V)-NTD induced actin cytoskeleton assembly, tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of the Erk1/Erk2 protein kinases. Adhesion to alpha4(V)-NTD is cell type-specific because rat fibroblasts failed to adhere to dishes coated with this polypeptide. Schwann cell adhesion and spreading on alpha4(V)-NTD was strongly inhibited by soluble heparin (IC(50) approximately 30 ng/ml) but not by chondroitin sulfate. Analysis of the heparin binding activities of a series of recombinant alpha4(V)-NTD fragments and deletion mutants identified a highly basic region (not present in other type V collagen NTD) as the site responsible for high affinity heparin binding. Schwann cells adhered poorly to dishes coated with alpha4(V)-NTD that lacked the heparin binding site and failed to spread or assemble organized actin-cytoskeletal structures. Soluble alpha4(V)-NTD polypeptide that contained the heparin binding site inhibited spreading of Schwann cells on dishes coated with alpha4(V)-NTD. Affinity chromatography of Schwann cell detergent extracts on a column of immobilized alpha4(V)-NTD resulted in the isolation of syndecan-3, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Together, these results suggest that Schwann cells bind to collagen type V via syndecan-3-dependent binding to a novel high affinity heparin binding site in the alpha4(V)-NTD.",,
15778503,Sclerostin binds to LRP5/6 and antagonizes canonical Wnt signaling.,"The loss of the SOST gene product sclerostin leads to sclerosteosis characterized by high bone mass. In this report, we found that sclerostin could antagonize canonical Wnt signaling in human embryonic kidney A293T cells and mouse osteoblastic MC3T3 cells. This sclerostin-mediated antagonism could be reversed by overexpression of Wnt co-receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5. In addition, we found that sclerostin bound to LRP5 as well as LRP6 and identified the first two YWTD-EGF repeat domains of LRP5 as being responsible for the binding. Although these two repeat domains are required for transduction of canonical Wnt signals, canonical Wnt did not appear to compete with sclerostin for binding to LRP5. Examination of the expression of sclerostin and Wnt7b, an autocrine canonical Wnt, during primary calvarial osteoblast differentiation revealed that sclerostin is expressed at late stages of osteoblast differentiation coinciding with the expression of osteogenic marker osteocalcin and trailing after the expression of Wnt7b. Given the plethora of evidence indicating that canonical Wnt signaling stimulates osteogenesis, we believe that the high bone mass phenotype associated with the loss of sclerostin may be attributed, at least in part, to an increase in canonical Wnt signaling resulting from the reduction in sclerostin-mediated Wnt antagonism.",,
23396314,Screening β-arrestin recruitment for the identification of natural ligands for orphan G-protein-coupled receptors.,"A variety of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) screening technologies have successfully partnered a number of GPCRs with their cognate ligands. GPCR-mediated β-arrestin recruitment is now recognized as a distinct intracellular signaling pathway, and ligand-receptor interactions may show a bias toward β-arrestin over classical GPCR signaling pathways. We hypothesized that the failure to identify native ligands for the remaining orphan GPCRs may be a consequence of biased β-arrestin signaling. To investigate this, we assembled 10 500 candidate ligands and screened 82 GPCRs using PathHunter β-arrestin recruitment technology. High-quality screening assays were validated by the inclusion of liganded receptors and the detection and confirmation of these established ligand-receptor pairings. We describe a candidate endogenous orphan GPCR ligand and a number of novel surrogate ligands. However, for the majority of orphan receptors studied, measurement of β-arrestin recruitment did not lead to the identification of cognate ligands from our screening sets. β-Arrestin recruitment represents a robust GPCR screening technology, and ligand-biased signaling is emerging as a therapeutically exploitable feature of GPCR biology. The identification of cognate ligands for the orphan GPCRs and the extent to which receptors may exist to preferentially signal through β-arrestin in response to their native ligand remain to be determined.",,
18448868,SDF-1/CXCR4 and VLA-4 interaction regulates homing in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.,"Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) is characterized by widespread involvement of the bone marrow at the time of diagnosis, implying continuous homing of WM cells into the marrow. The mechanisms by which trafficking of the malignant cells into the bone marrow has not been previously elucidated. In this study, we show that WM cells express high levels of chemokine and adhesion receptors, including CXCR4 and VLA-4. We showed that CXCR4 was essential for the migration and trans-endothelial migration of WM cells under static and dynamic shear flow conditions, with significant inhibition of migration using CXCR4 knockdown or the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100. Similarly, CXCR4 or VLA-4 inhibition led to significant inhibition of adhesion to fibronectin, stromal cells, and endothelial cells. Decreased adhesion of WM cells to stromal cells by AMD3100 led to increased sensitivity of these cells to cytotoxicity by bortezomib. To further investigate the mechanisms of CXCR4-dependent adhesion, we showed that CXCR4 and VLA-4 directly interact in response to SDF-1, we further investigated downstream signaling pathways regulating migration and adhesion in WM. Together, these studies demonstrate that the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis interacts with VLA-4 in regulating migration and adhesion of WM cells in the bone marrow microenvironment.",Blood,2008
11742004,Second cysteine-rich domain of Dickkopf-2 activates canonical Wnt signaling pathway via LRP-6 independently of dishevelled.,"Recent evidence suggests that members of the Dickkopf (Dkk) family can directly bind to LDL-related protein (LRP)-6, resulting in inhibition of Wnt-activated signaling. To further characterize the interactions between Dkk and LRP proteins, conditioned media containing individually conserved cysteine-rich domains of Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 were prepared. Although full-length Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 and the second cysteine-rich domains of both Dkk molecules inhibited Wnt-3a-induced activation of lymphoid enhancing factor (LEF)-1, a downstream target of the canonical pathway, we found that the second cysteine-rich domain of Dkk-2 (Dkk-2C2) was able to stimulate the canonical pathway when LRP-6 was ectopically expressed in NIH3T3 cells. This effect of Dkk-2C2 could be blocked by a monoclonal antibody specific to the second YWTD repeat domain of LRP-5/6, suggesting that Dkk-2C2 acts via LRP-6. We also showed that while both Axin and the DIX domain of Dishevelled (Dvl) could inhibit Dkk-2C2-induced activation of LEF-1, the DEP domain of Dvl, which inhibited Wnt-induced activation of LEF-1, failed to inhibit the activation of LEF-1 by Dkk-2C2 or by an activated form of LRP-5, LRPC2. In addition, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, a potent inhibitor for both Dvl and Wnt, also failed to inhibit LRPC2 or Dkk-2C2. Furthermore, knocking-down the expression of Dvl molecules by short interfering RNAs specific to Dvl inhibited Wnt-induced, but not LRPC2-induced, activation of LEF-1. All the evidence indicates that Dkk-2C2 signals through LRP proteins, which does not require Dvl, while Wnt protein may employ both Dvl, presumably through Fz, and LRP to achieve more efficient signal transduction.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
11907075,Secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (CCL21) activates CXCR3 to trigger a Cl- current and chemotaxis in murine microglia.,"Microglial cells represent the major immunocompetent element of the CNS and are activated by any type of brain injury or disease. A candidate for signaling neuronal injury to microglial cells is the CC chemokine ligand CCL21, given that damaged neurons express CCL21. Investigating microglia in acute slices and in culture, we demonstrate that a local application of CCL21 for 30 s triggered a Cl(-) conductance with lasted for tens of minutes. This response was sensitive to the Cl(-) channel blockers 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and 4-acetamide-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene, 2,2'-disulfonic acid. Moreover, CCL21 triggered a chemotaxis response, which was sensitive to Cl(-) channel blockers. In microglial cells cultured from CCR7 knockout mice, CCL21 produced the same type of Cl(-) current as well as a chemotaxis response. In contrast, in microglial cells from CXCR3 knockout mice, CCL21 triggered neither a Cl(-) conductance nor a chemotaxis response after CCL21 application. We conclude that the CCL21-induced Cl(-) current is a prerequisite for the chemotaxis response mediated by the activation of CXCR3 but not CCR7 receptors, indicating that in brain CCL21 acts via a different receptor system than in lymphoid organs.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2002
9507024,Secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine is a functional ligand for the CC chemokine receptor CCR7.,"Secondary Lymphoid-tissue Chemokine (SLC) is a recently identified CC chemokine that is constitutively expressed in various lymphoid tissues and is a potent and specific chemoattractant for lymphocytes. The SLC gene and the gene encoding another lymphocyte-specific CC chemokine, EBI1-ligand chemokine (ELC), form a mini-cluster at human chromosome 9p13. Here, we show that SLC is a high affinity functional ligand for chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) that is expressed on T and B lymphocytes and a known receptor for ELC. SLC induced a vigorous calcium mobilization in murine L1.2 cells stably expressing human CCR7. SLC tagged with the secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SLC-SEAP) showed specific binding to CCR7 that was fully competed by SLC with an IC50 of 0.5 nM. SLC also induced a vigorous chemotactic response in CCR7-expressing L1.2 cells with a typical bell-shaped dose-response curve and a maximal migration at 10 nM. When assessed using CCR7-transfected L1.2 cells, SLC and ELC were essentially equivalent in terms of cross desensitization in calcium mobilization via CCR7, cross-competition in binding to CCR7, and induction of chemotaxis via CCR7. SLC and ELC were also shown to fully share receptors expressed on cultured normal T cells known to express CCR7. Notably, however, SLC was somehow less efficient in cross-desensitization against ELC in calcium mobilization and in cross-competition with ELC for binding when assessed using cultured normal T cells. Thus, SLC and ELC, even though sharing only 32% amino acid identity, constitute a genetically and functionally highly related subgroup of CC chemokines.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
9013976,Secreted chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan of human B cell lines binds to the complement protein C1q and inhibits complex formation of C1.,"We recently characterized a species of proteochondroitin sulfate (CSPG) secreted by human B cell lines that closely resembles in its structure the serum-derived C1q inhibitor (C1qI). These proteoglycans have in common a molecular mass of approximately 130 to 150 kDa with a core protein of 30 kDa to which up to four chondroitin sulfate chains each of approximately 26 kDa are attached. Since this B cell-derived CSPG is a potential source for serum C1qI, we measured its capacity to interact with C1q in solid-phase binding and complex electrophoresis assays. B cell CSPG purified from culture supernatants of the two human B cell lines JOK-1 and U266 strongly bound to C1q. In contrast to the secreted form, cellular proteoglycan of the myeloma cell line U266 did not interact with C1q. Binding of C1q to CSPG was competitively inhibited by free glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the order dextran sulfate > heparin > heparan sulfate > chondroitin-6-sulfate (CS-C) > dermatan sulfate (CS-B) > chondroitin-4-sulfate (CS-A). B cell CSPG inhibited the hemolytic activity of C1q and C1. In addition, B cell CSPG blocked C1q receptor binding in a dose-dependent manner. The proteoglycans did not influence the activity of C1 complex already bound to EAC4 target cells. By interaction of CSPG with solid-phase-bound C1q, formation of the C1 complex upon the addition of C1r and C1s was impaired. Strong binding of B cell CSPG to C1q, its inhibition of C1q activity, and its structural similarities to the previously described human serum C1qI indicate that B cells produce a soluble CSPG, which may act as C1qI under physiologic conditions.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1997
18567805,Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 regulates two Wnt7a signaling pathways and inhibits proliferation in endometrial cancer cells.,"In the endometrium, hormonal effects on epithelial cells are often elicited through stromal hormone receptors via unknown paracrine mechanisms. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that Wnts participate in stromal-epithelial cell communication. Wnt7a is expressed in the luminal epithelium, whereas the extracellular modulator of Wnt signaling, secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4), is localized to the stroma. Studies have reported that SFRP4 expression is significantly decreased in endometrial carcinoma and that both SFRP4 and Wnt7a genes are differentially regulated in response to estrogenic stimuli. Aberrant Wnt7a signaling irrevocably causes organ defects and infertility and contributes to the onset of disease. However, specific frizzled receptors (Fzd) that bind Wnt7a and the particular signal transduction pathway each Wnt7a-Fzd pair activates have not been identified. Additionally, the function of SFRP4 in the endometrium has not been addressed. We show here that Wnt7a coimmunoprecipitates with Fzd5, Fzd10, and SFRP4 in Ishikawa cells. Wnt7a binding to Fzd5 was shown to activate beta-catenin/canonical Wnt signaling and increase cellular proliferation. Conversely, Wnt7a signaling mediated by Fzd10 induced a noncanonical c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-responsive pathway. SFRP4 suppresses activation of Wnt7a signaling in both an autocrine and paracrine manner. Stable overexpression of SFRP4 and treatment with recombinant SFRP4 protein inhibited endometrial cancer cell growth in vitro. These findings support a mechanism by which the nature of the Wnt7a signal in the endometrium is dependent on the Fzd repertoire of the cell and can be regulated by SFRP4.",Molecular cancer research : MCR,2008
28846069,Secreted protein Del-1 regulates myelopoiesis in the hematopoietic stem cell niche.,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remain mostly quiescent under steady-state conditions but switch to a proliferative state following hematopoietic stress, e.g., bone marrow (BM) injury, transplantation, or systemic infection and inflammation. The homeostatic balance between quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation of HSCs is strongly dependent on their interactions with cells that constitute a specialized microanatomical environment in the BM known as the HSC niche. Here, we identified the secreted extracellular matrix protein Del-1 as a component and regulator of the HSC niche. Specifically, we found that Del-1 was expressed by several cellular components of the HSC niche, including arteriolar endothelial cells, CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells, and cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Del-1 promoted critical functions of the HSC niche, as it regulated long-term HSC (LT-HSC) proliferation and differentiation toward the myeloid lineage. Del-1 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced LT-HSC proliferation and infringed preferentially upon myelopoiesis under both steady-state and stressful conditions, such as hematopoietic cell transplantation and G-CSF- or inflammation-induced stress myelopoiesis. Del-1-induced HSC proliferation and myeloid lineage commitment were mediated by β3 integrin on hematopoietic progenitors. This hitherto unknown Del-1 function in the HSC niche represents a juxtacrine homeostatic adaptation of the hematopoietic system in stress myelopoiesis.",The Journal of clinical investigation,2017
19064997,Secreted trefoil factor 2 activates the CXCR4 receptor in epithelial and lymphocytic cancer cell lines.,"The secreted trefoil factor family 2 (TFF2) protein contributes to the protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa from injury by strengthening and stabilizing mucin gels, stimulating epithelial restitution, and restraining the associated inflammation. Although trefoil factors have been shown to activate signaling pathways, no cell surface receptor has been directly linked to trefoil peptide signaling. Here we demonstrate the ability of TFF2 peptide to activate signaling via the CXCR4 chemokine receptor in cancer cell lines. We found that both mouse and human TFF2 proteins (at approximately 0.5 microm) activate Ca2+ signaling in lymphoblastic Jurkat cells that could be abrogated by receptor desensitization (with SDF-1alpha) or pretreatment with the specific antagonist AMD3100 or an anti-CXCR4 antibody. TFF2 pretreatment of Jurkat cells decreased Ca2+ rise and chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha. In addition, the CXCR4-negative gastric epithelial cell line AGS became highly responsive to TFF2 treatment upon expression of the CXCR4 receptor. TFF2-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in gastric and pancreatic cancer cells, KATO III and AsPC-1, respectively, was also dependent on the presence of the CXCR4 receptor. Finally we demonstrate a distinct proliferative effect of TFF2 protein on an AGS gastric cancer cell line that expresses CXCR4. Overall these data identify CXCR4 as a bona fide signaling receptor for TFF2 and suggest a mechanism through which TFF2 may modulate immune and tumorigenic responses in vivo.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2009
24157461,SECTM1 produced by tumor cells attracts human monocytes via CD7-mediated activation of the PI3K pathway.,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have essential roles in tumor progression and metastasis. Tumor cells recruit myeloid progenitors and monocytes to the tumor site, where they differentiate into TAMs; however, this process is not well studied in humans. Here we show that human CD7, a T-cell and NK cell receptor, is highly expressed by monocytes and macrophages. Expression of CD7 decreases in M-CSF-differentiated macrophages and in melanoma-conditioned medium-induced macrophages (MCMI/Mφ) in comparison to monocytes. A ligand for CD7, SECTM1 (secreted and transmembrane protein 1), is highly expressed in many tumors, including melanoma cells. We show that SECTM1 binds to CD7 and significantly increases monocyte migration by activation of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase) pathway. In human melanoma tissues, tumor-infiltrating macrophages expressing CD7 are present. These melanomas, with CD7-positive inflammatory cell infiltrations, frequently highly express SECTM1, including an N-terminal, soluble form, which can be detected in the sera of metastatic melanoma patients but not in normal sera. Taken together, our data demonstrate that CD7 is present on monocytes and tumor macrophages and that its ligand, SECTM1, is frequently expressed in corresponding melanoma tissues, possibly acting as a chemoattractant for monocytes to modulate the melanoma microenvironment.",,
11032250,Selection of peptide ligands that bind to acid fibroblast growth factor.,"Acid fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) binds to its cell-surface receptors in a heparin-dependent manner. In an attempt to define the aFGF recognition site on fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), we developed a screening strategy for identifying FGF ligands that bind to the receptor-binding region of FGF. To retain the natural conformation of aFGF during screening, we used biotinylated heparin to immobilize aFGF on a streptavidin-coated dish. A 15-mer phage display peptide library was then screened in the dish and a group of related peptide sequences was identified. These peptide sequences contain two conserved motifs, SSG and VPS, corresponding to two protein sequences of the immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain II of FGFR1 at amino acids 180-182 and 221-223 (CPSSG-VPSDKGNYTC). Further experiments demonstrate that the phage displaying these sequences can specifically bind to aFGF and that the synthesized peptide corresponding in sequence can inhibit mitogenic activity of aFGF. These sequences may thus constitute part of the aFGF-binding region on FGFR1, and the synthesized peptide has the potential to become a therapeutic agent as an aFGF antagonist.",IUBMB life,2000
1672777,Selective activation of the B natriuretic peptide receptor by C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).,"The natriuretic peptides are hormones that can stimulate natriuretic, diuretic, and vasorelaxant activity in vivo, presumably through the activation of two known cell surface receptor guanylyl cyclases (ANPR-A and ANPR-B). Although atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and, to a lesser extent, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are efficient activators of the ANPR-A guanylyl cyclase, neither hormone can significantly stimulate ANPR-B. A member of this hormone family, C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), potently and selectively activated the human ANPR-B guanylyl cyclase. CNP does not increase guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate accumulation in cells expressing human ANPR-A. The affinity of CNP for ANPR-B is 50- or 500-fold higher than ANP or BNP, respectively. This ligand-receptor pair may be involved in the regulation of fluid homeostasis by the central nervous system.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1991
18287331,"Selective binding of RGMc/hemojuvelin, a key protein in systemic iron metabolism, to BMP-2 and neogenin.","Juvenile hemochromatosis is a severe and rapidly progressing hereditary disorder of iron overload, and it is caused primarily by defects in the gene encoding repulsive guidance molecule c/hemojuvelin (RGMc/HJV), a recently identified protein that undergoes a complicated biosynthetic pathway in muscle and liver, leading to cell membrane-linked single-chain and heterodimeric species, and two secreted single-chain isoforms. RGMc modulates expression of the hepatic iron regulatory factor, hepcidin, potentially through effects on signaling by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of soluble growth factors. To date, little is known about specific pathogenic defects in disease-causing RGMc/HJV proteins. Here we identify functional abnormalities in three juvenile hemochromatosis-linked mutants. Using a combination of approaches, we first show that BMP-2 could interact in biochemical assays with single-chain RGMc species, and also could bind to cell-associated RGMc. Two mouse RGMc amino acid substitution mutants, D165E and G313V (corresponding to human D172E and G320V), also could bind BMP-2, but less effectively than wild-type RGMc, while G92V (human G99V) could not. In contrast, the membrane-spanning protein, neogenin, a receptor for the related molecule, RGMa, preferentially bound membrane-associated heterodimeric RGMc and was able to interact on cells only with wild-type RGMc and G92V. Our results show that different isoforms of RGMc/HJV may play unique physiological roles through defined interactions with distinct signaling proteins and demonstrate that, in some disease-linked RGMc mutants, these interactions are defective.",American journal of physiology.

10660125,Selective binding of the truncated form of the chemokine CKbeta8 (25-99) to CC chemokine receptor 1(CCR1).,"Human CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) has been proposed as a receptor for CKbeta8. To obtain conclusive evidence, binding-displacement studies of 125I-CKbeta8 (25-99) were performed on membranes of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human CCR1. The Ic50 for displacement of 125I-CKbeta8 (25-99) with CKbeta8 (25-99) was 0.22 nM. The longer forms of CKbeta8 (24-99 and 1-99) also displaced 125I-CKbeta8, with Ic50 values of 6.5 and 16 nM, respectively. Displacement profiles of 125I-CKbeta8 (25-99) on freshly prepared human monocytes indicated that CCR1 was the major receptor for CKbeta8. We conclude that CCR1 is a receptor for different-length CKbeta8 and that CKbeta8 (25-99) has a similar affinity for CCR1 as macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha). The longer variants of CKbeta8 are significantly less potent than CKbeta8 (25-99) and MIP-1a on CCR1 and monocytes (P < 0.05).",Biochemical pharmacology,2000
12270118,Selective CCL5/RANTES-induced mast cell migration through interactions with chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR4.,"Mast cells (MCs) accumulate at sites of allergic mucosal inflammation where they act as central effector and regulatory cells. Because chemokines are of vital importance in directing inflammatory leukocytes to the sites of inflammations, we have investigated the expression and function of CC-chemokine receptor (CCR) on human MCs. Two previously unrecognized MC-chemokine receptors, CCR1 and CCR4, could be identified on cord blood-derived MCs (CBMCs). CCR1 and CCR4 expressed on CBMCs exhibited a unique response profile. Of seven CCR1 and CCR4 agonists tested, only CCL5/RANTES act as an agonist inducing chemotaxis. The migration could be partially blocked by specific antibodies against CCR1 or CCR4, while a complete inhibition was achieved when both CCR1 and CCR4 were blocked. These results demonstrate that both CCR1 and CCR4 are functional receptors on human mast cells with capacity to mediate migration towards CCL5.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2002
22286174,Selective control of inhibitory synapse development by Slitrk3-PTPδ trans-synaptic interaction.,"Balanced development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses is required for normal brain function, and an imbalance in this development may underlie the pathogenesis of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Compared with the many identified trans-synaptic adhesion complexes that organize excitatory synapses, little is known about the organizers that are specific for inhibitory synapses. We found that Slit and NTRK-like family member 3 (Slitrk3) actS as a postsynaptic adhesion molecule that selectively regulates inhibitory synapse development via trans-interaction with axonal tyrosine phosphatase receptor PTPδ. When expressed in fibroblasts, Slitrk3 triggered only inhibitory presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons of co-cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Recombinant Slitrk3 preferentially localized to inhibitory postsynaptic sites. Slitrk3-deficient mice exhibited decreases in inhibitory, but not excitatory, synapse number and function in hippocampal CA1 neurons and exhibited increased seizure susceptibility and spontaneous epileptiform activity. Slitrk3 required trans-interaction with axonal PTPδ to induce inhibitory presynaptic differentiation. These results identify Slitrk3-PTPδ as an inhibitory-specific trans-synaptic organizing complex that is required for normal functional GABAergic synapse development.",,
20527893,Selective hexapeptide agonists and antagonists for human complement C3a receptor.,"Human anaphylatoxin C3a, formed through cleavage of complement protein C3, is a potent effector of innate immunity via activation of its G protein coupled receptor, human C3aR. Previously reported short peptide ligands for this receptor either have low potency or lack receptor selectivity. Here we report the first small peptide agonists that are both potent and selective for human C3aR, derived from structure-activity relationships of peptides based on the C-terminus of C3a. Affinity for C3aR was examined by competitive binding with (125)I-labeled C3a to human PBMCs [corrected], agonist versus antagonist activity measured using fluorescence detection of intracellular calcium, and general selectivity monitored by C3a-induced receptor desensitization. An NMR structure for an agonist in DMSO showed a beta-turn motif that may be important for C3aR binding and activation. Derivatization produced a noncompetitive and insurmountable antagonist of C3aR. Small molecule C3a agonists and antagonists may be valuable probes of immunity and inflammatory diseases.",,
1737795,Selective inactivation of the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) binding site in von Willebrand factor by site-directed mutagenesis.,"In order to assess the requirement for the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) consensus adhesion sequence in von Willebrand factor (vWF) for vWF binding to platelets and endothelial cells, point mutations were introduced into this sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. A glycine to alanine substitution yielded RADS-vWF, while an aspartate to glutamate substitution resulted in RGES-vWF. Recombinant RADS-vWF and RGES-vWF, purified from transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells, were compared with recombinant wild type vWF (WT-vWF) in functional assays with platelets and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HU-VECs). High molecular weight RADS-vWF and RGES-vWF multimers inhibited binding of 125I-vWF to a mixture of insolubilized native type I and III collagen and competed effectively with 125I-vWF for binding to formalin-fixed platelets in the presence of ristocetin, indicating functional collagen and platelet glycoprotein Ib binding. However, RADS-vWF and RGES-vWF were unable to displace the binding of 125I-vWF to thrombin or ADP-activated platelets. The attachment of HUVECs to either RADS-vWF or RGES-vWF coated surfaces was reduced and spreading was almost completely inhibited, compared with WT-vWF. We conclude that point mutations of the RGDS sequence in vWF selectively impair binding to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and the HUVEC vitronectin receptor.",,
12604689,Selective tryptic cleavage at the tethered ligand site of the amino terminal domain of proteinase-activated receptor-2 in intact cells.,"In intact cells, trypsin activates proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR(2)) by hydrolysis at residues R(36)/S(37) (amino acids are abbreviated by their one-letter code), revealing an active tethered ligand sequence. We sought to determine whether in intact cells, the tryptic cleavage/activation of PAR(2) might also be accompanied by hydrolysis at other potential N-terminal cleavage sites, like residues K(34), R(41), K(51), and K(72), as implied by the tryptic cleavage in vitro at these residues of Escherichia coli-expressed human N-terminal PAR(2)R(31)-P(79). To this end, four PAR(2) mutants with altered tryptic cleavage sites were prepared (PAR(2)R(36)A, PAR(2)S(37)P, PAR(2)R(41)A, and PAR(2)R(36)AR(41)A), expressed in Kirsten virus-transformed rat kidney cells and were evaluated together with the wild-type PAR(2)-expressing cells for 1) activation (Ca(2+) signaling) by trypsin and the receptor-activating peptide SLIGRL-NH(2) (SL-NH(2)) and 2) the tryptic release of two antigenic receptor determinants, one N-terminal to the R(36)/S(37) cleavage/activation site detected by SLAW-A antibody and the second (detected by antibody, B5), N-terminal to residues K(51), K(72). None of the mutants resistant to cleavage at R(36) were activated by trypsin, yet all retained reactivity to B5 and all were activated by SL-NH(2). In contrast, trypsin activated both wild-type and PAR(2)R(41)A, leading to a disappearance of SLAW-A but not B5 reactivity. We conclude that, as opposed to the E. coli-expressed PAR(2) N-terminal polypeptide, PAR(2) expressed in intact cells displays selective tryptic cleavage at the R(36)/S(37) activation site, without cleaving downstream. Thus, in intact cells, trypsin activation does not concurrently ""disarm"" rat PAR(2), but leaves the ""tethered ligand"" persistently attached to the body of the receptor.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2003
11606131,"Selective, high affinity peptide antagonists of alpha-melanotropin action at human melanocortin receptor 4: their synthesis and biological evaluation in vitro.","Peptide Ac-Nle(4)-cyclo(5beta-->10epsilon)(Asp(5)-His(6)-D-(2')Nal(7)-Arg(8)-Trp(9)-Lys(10))-NH(2), compound 1, a cyclic derivative of alpha-melanotropin, is a nonselective high affinity antagonist at human melanocortin receptors 3 and 4, and an agonist at melanocortin receptors 1 and 5. To differentiate between the physiological functions of these receptors, antagonists with improved receptor selectivity are needed. In this study, analogues of compound 1 without Ac-Nle(4) or His(6) and/or the amino group of Asp(5) were prepared and tested in binding assays and in functional assays on CHO cells expressing hMC3-5R. Several of these peptides were to be selective, high affinity hMC-4R antagonists. The most interesting was compound 10, named MBP10, cyclo(6beta-->10epsilon)(succinyl(6)-D-(2')Nal(7)-Arg(8)-Trp(9)-Lys(10))-NH(2), an antagonist (IC(50) = 0.5 nM) with 125-fold selectivity over hMC-3R (and of >300-fold selectivity over MC-1RB). This compound had no agonist activity at hMC-3R or hMC-4R and only weak agonist activity at hMC-5R. Examination of the sequences of these new peptides revealed that the D-(2')Nal(7)-Arg(8)-Trp(9) segment of peptide 1 forms the ""essential core"" required for high affinity and high selectivity of analogues of peptide 1 at hMC-4R, but the ""extended core"", His(6)-D-(2')Nal(7)-Arg(8)-Trp(9), is necessary for the maximum affinity for hMC-3R and hMC-5R.",Journal of medicinal chemistry,2001
16158071,Selectivity of d[Cha4]AVP and SSR149415 at human vasopressin and oxytocin receptors: evidence that SSR149415 is a mixed vasopressin V1b/oxytocin receptor antagonist.,"1 A possible role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1b) receptor subtype in stress-related disorders has been recently highlighted by the discovery of the agonist [1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] AVP (d[Cha(4)]AVP) and the antagonist SSR149415. Both compounds have been proposed to target specifically V(1b) receptors, since the reported affinities for the related V(1a), V(2) and oxytocin receptors are in the micromolar or submicromolar range. In the present study, we further investigated the binding affinities of d[Cha(4)]AVP and SSR149415 at recombinant human vasopressin V(1b) (hV(1b)) and oxytocin (hOT) receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and functional properties of both compounds at hV(1b), hV(1a), hV(2) and hOT receptors. 2 d[Cha(4)]AVP bound to hV(1b) receptors and hOT receptors with pK(i) values of 9.68+/-0.06 and 7.68+/-0.09, respectively. SSR149415 showed pK(i) values of 9.34+/-0.06 at hV(1b) and 8.82+/-0.16 at hOT receptors. 3 d[Cha(4)]AVP stimulated [Ca(2+)](i) increase in hV(1b)-CHO cells with a pEC(50) value of 10.05+/-0.15. It showed pEC(50) values of 6.53+/-0.17 and 5.92+/-0.02 at hV(1a) and hV(2) receptors, respectively, and behaved as a weak antagonist at hOT receptors (pK(B)=6.31+/-0.12). SSR149415 inhibited the agonist-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase with pK(B) values of 9.19+/-0.07 in hV(1b)-CHO and 8.72+/-0.15 in hOT-CHO cells. A functional pK(i) value of 7.23+/-0.10 was found for SSR1494151 at hV(1a) receptors, whereas it did not inhibit 20 nM AVP response at hV(2) receptors up to 3 microM. 4 Data obtained confirmed the high potency and selectivity of d[Cha(4)]AVP at hV(1b) receptors, but revealed that SSR149415, in addition to the high potency at hV(1b) receptors, displays a significant antagonism at hOT receptors.",British journal of pharmacology,2005
15330859,Sema4D stimulates axonal outgrowth of embryonic DRG sensory neurones.,"Several semaphorins are thought to function as potent inhibitors of axonal growth. We have found that Sema4D stimulates axonal outgrowth of embryonic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones in stead of retraction. Neutralizing antibodies to Sema4D inhibit this action. This action appears to differ slightly from that on PC12 cells, because DRG neurones respond to Sema4D without addition of nerve growth factor (NGF), while PC12 cells do not. On the other hand, it is blocked by deprivation of endogenous NGF with antibodies to NGF and also by Trk-inhibitor K252a, suggesting that endogenously produced-NGF and the activation of Trk receptor are required for Sema4D-action on DRG neurones. These indicate that neurite-outgrowth promoting actions of Sema4D are similar between DRG neurones and PC12 cells, since NGF-Trk signalling are required for these actions. Since Schwann cells can produce NGF, the contamination of these cells in our DRG culture might explain this action. In addition to plexin-B1 that is known as a Sema4D receptor, binding experiments indicate plexin-B2 as another receptor candidate for Sema4D. These plexins and Sema4D are expressed in embryonic DRGs. We suggest a new function of Sema4D as a neurite-outgrowth stimulating, autocrine/paracrine factor in embryonic sensory neurones.",Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,2004
15550623,Semaphorin 3E and plexin-D1 control vascular pattern independently of neuropilins.,"The development of a patterned vasculature is essential for normal organogenesis. We found that signaling by semaphorin 3E (Sema3E) and its receptor plexin-D1 controls endothelial cell positioning and the patterning of the developing vasculature in the mouse. Sema3E is highly expressed in developing somites, where it acts as a repulsive cue for plexin-D1-expressing endothelial cells of adjacent intersomitic vessels. Sema3E-plexin-D1 signaling did not require neuropilins, which were previously presumed to be obligate Sema3 coreceptors. Moreover, genetic ablation of Sema3E or plexin-D1 but not neuropilin-mediated Sema3 signaling disrupted vascular patterning. These findings reveal an unexpected semaphorin signaling pathway and define a mechanism for controlling vascular patterning.",,
21122816,Semaphorin 4C and 4G are ligands of Plexin-B2 required in cerebellar development.,"Semaphorins and Plexins are cognate ligand-receptor families that regulate important steps during nervous system development. The Plexin-B2 receptor is critically involved in neural tube closure and cerebellar granule cell development, however, its specific ligands have only been suggested by in vitro studies. Here, we show by in vivo and in vitro analyses that the two Semaphorin-4 family members Sema4C and Sema4G are likely to be in vivo ligands of Plexin-B2. The Sema4C and Sema4G genes are expressed in the developing cerebellar cortex, and Sema4C and Sema4G proteins specifically bind to Plexin-B2 expressing cerebellar granule cells. To further elucidate their in vivo function, we have generated and analyzed Sema4C and Sema4G knockout mouse mutants. Like Plexin-B2-/- mutants, Sema4C-/- mutants reveal exencephaly and subsequent neonatal lethality with partial penetrance. Sema4C-/- mutants that bypass exencephaly are viable and fertile, but display distinctive defects of the cerebellar granule cell layer, including gaps in rostral lobules, fusions of caudal lobules, and ectopic granule cells in the molecular layer. In addition to neuronal defects, we observed in Sema4C-/- mutants also ventral skin pigmentation defects that are similar to those found in Plexin-B2-/- mutants. The Sema4G gene deletion causes no overt phenotype by itself, but combined deletion of Sema4C and Sema4G revealed an enhanced cerebellar phenotype. However, Sema4C/Sema4G double mutants showed overall less severe cerebellar phenotypes than Plexin-B2-/- mutants, indicating that further ligands of Plexin-B2 exist. In explant cultures of the developing cerebellar cortex, Sema4C promoted migration of cerebellar granule cell precursors in a Plexin-B2-dependent manner, supporting the model that a reduced migration rate of granule cell precursors is the basis for the cerebellar defects of Sema4C-/- and Sema4C/Sema4G mutants.",Molecular and cellular neurosciences,2011
25209245,Semaphorin 6B acts as a receptor in post-crossing commissural axon guidance.,"Semaphorins are a large family of axon guidance molecules that are known primarily as ligands for plexins and neuropilins. Although class-6 semaphorins are transmembrane proteins, they have been implicated as ligands in different aspects of neural development, including neural crest cell migration, axon guidance and cerebellar development. However, the specific spatial and temporal expression of semaphorin 6B (Sema6B) in chick commissural neurons suggested a receptor role in axon guidance at the spinal cord midline. Indeed, in the absence of Sema6B, post-crossing commissural axons lacked an instructive signal directing them rostrally along the contralateral floorplate border, resulting in stalling at the exit site or even caudal turns. Truncated Sema6B lacking the intracellular domain was unable to rescue the loss-of-function phenotype, confirming a receptor function of Sema6B. In support of this, we demonstrate that Sema6B binds to floorplate-derived plexin A2 (PlxnA2) for navigation at the midline, whereas a cis-interaction between PlxnA2 and Sema6B on pre-crossing commissural axons may regulate the responsiveness of axons to floorplate-derived cues.","Development (Cambridge, England)",2014
17318185,"Semaphorin-4A, an activator for T-cell-mediated immunity, suppresses angiogenesis via Plexin-D1.","Originally identified as axon guidance molecules, semaphorins are now known to be widely expressed mediators that play significant roles in immune responses and organ morphogenesis. However, not much is known about the signaling pathways via which they exert their organ-specific effects. Here we demonstrate that Sema4A, previously identified as an activator of T-cell-mediated immunity, is expressed in endothelial cells, where it suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated endothelial cell migration and proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. Mice lacking Sema4A exhibit enhanced angiogenesis in response to VEGF or inflammatory stimuli. In addition, binding and functional experiments revealed Plexin-D1 to be a receptor for Sema4A on endothelial cells, indicating that Sema4A exerts organ-specific activities via different receptor-mediated signaling pathways: via Plexin-D1 in the endothelial cells and via T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-2 in T cells. The effects of Sema4A on endothelial cells are dependent on its ability to suppress VEGF-mediated Rac activation and integrin-dependent cell adhesion. It thus appears that Sema4A-Plexin-D1 signaling negatively regulates angiogenesis.",The EMBO journal,2007
9883722,Semaphorin-neuropilin interactions underlying sympathetic axon responses to class III semaphorins.,"Neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2 show specificity in binding to different class III semaphorins, including Sema III, Sema E, and Sema IV, suggesting that the specificity of action of these semaphorins is dictated by the complement of neuropilins expressed by responsive neurons. In support of this, we show that sympathetic axons coexpress neuropilin-1 and -2, that their responses to Sema III, Sema E, and Sema IV are affected in predicted ways by antibodies to neuropilin-1, and that neuropilin-1 and -2 can form homo- and heterooligomers through an interaction involving at least partly the neuropilin MAM (meprin, A5, mu) domain. These results support the idea that in sympathetic axons, the Sema III signal is mediated predominantly by neuropilin-1 oligomers, the Sema IV signal by neuropilin-2 oligomers, and the Sema E signal by neuropilin-1 and -2, either as homo- or heterooligomers.",,
10196546,Semaphorins A and E act as antagonists of neuropilin-1 and agonists of neuropilin-2 receptors.,"Neuropilin-1 (NP-1) has been identified as a necessary component of a semaphorin D (SemD) receptor that repulses dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons during development. SemA and SemE are related to SemD and bind to NP-1, but do not repulse DRG axons. By expressing NP-1 in retinal neurons and NP-2 in DRG neurons, we demonstrate that neuropilins are sufficient to determine the functional specificity of semaphorin responsiveness. SemA and SemE block SemD binding to NP-1 and abolish SemD repulsion in axons expressing NP-1. SemA and SemE seem to have a newly discovered protein antagonist capacity at NP-1 receptors, whereas they act as agonists at receptors containing NP-2.",Nature neuroscience,1998
26407101,Seminal CD38 Enhances Human Sperm Capacitation through Its Interaction with CD31.,"Human sperm have to undergo a maturational process called capacitation in the female reproductive tract. Capacitation confers upon the sperm an ability to gain hypermotility and undergo acrosome reaction. Previous studies have suggested that seminal plasma proteins induce the capacitation of sperm in the female reproductive tract for the successful fertilization of the oocyte. However, the function of seminal plasma proteins in capacitation remains largely unclear. To the end, we found that soluble CD38 (sCD38) in seminal plasma increases the capacitation of sperm via specific interactions between sCD38 and the CD31 on the sperm. Upon the association of sCD38 with CD31, tyrosine kinase Src phosphorylates CD31, a process blocked by Src inhibitors. Shc, SHP-2, Grb2, and SOS, as well as Src kinase were found to associate with the phosphorylated CD31. The sCD38-induced phosphorylation of CD31 initiates a cascade reaction through the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, which results in the acrosome reaction, and sperm hypermotility. These processes were prevented by Src, Ras and MEK inhibitors. Taken together, these data indicate that the sCD38 present in seminal plasma plays a critical role in the capacitation of sperm.",PloS one,2015
1379600,Sense and antisense cDNA transfection of CD36 (glycoprotein IV) in melanoma cells. Role of CD36 as a thrombospondin receptor.,"Thrombospondin (TSP) is a multifunctional matrix and platelet glycoprotein that interacts with cell surfaces and may play a role in mediating cell adhesion, platelet aggregation, platelet-monocyte interactions, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, tumor metastasis, and protease generation. To clarify and confirm the function of CD36 (glycoprotein IV) as a TSP receptor, we now describe a transfected cell model using human melanoma cells genetically manipulated by sense or antisense cDNA transfection to express either high or near zero levels of CD36. Surface expression was confirmed by flow cytometry with monoclonal anti-CD36 IgG and quantified by measuring radiolabeled antibody binding. Bowes melanoma cells, which in their wild type did not express CD36 and did not bind radiolabeled TSP, when transfected with the sense construct bound TSP in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with CD36 expression. Conversely, C32 melanoma cells, which in their wild type expressed high levels of CD36 and bound radiolabeled TSP at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, did not express CD36 and did not bind TSP when transfected with an antisense construct. In addition, transfected Bowes cells and wild type C32 cells, unlike wild type Bowes cells, adhered to activated platelets in a TSP-dependent manner. These data, i.e. the gain of function with sense cDNA transfection and loss of function with antisense transfection, strongly support the TSP receptor function of CD36. The distribution of this protein in vascular cells and tissues and observations that it may participate in signal transduction events suggest that TSP-CD36 interactions may play a role in mediating some of the pathophysiological processes associated with TSP.",,
8985159,Septide and neurokinin A are high-affinity ligands on the NK-1 receptor: evidence from homologous versus heterologous binding analysis.,"The three main tachykinins, substance P, neurokinin A (NKA), and neurokinin B, are believed to be selective ligands for respectively the NK-1, NK-2 and NK-3 receptors. However, NKA also has actions which cannot be mediated through its normal NK-2 receptor and the synthetic peptide [pGlu6,Pro9]-Substance P9-11--called septide--is known to have tachykinin-like actions despite its apparent lack of binding to any known tachykinin receptor. In the cloned NK-1 receptor expressed in COS-7 cells NKA and septide as expected were poor competitors for radiolabeled substance P. However, by using radiolabeled NKA and septide directly, it was found that both peptides in homologous binding assays as well as in competition against each other in fact bound to the NK-1 receptor with high affinity: Kd values of 0.51 +/- 0.15 nM (NKA) and 0.55 +/- 0.03 nM (septide). It is concluded that NKA and septide are high-affinity ligands for the NK-1 receptor but that they are poor competitors for substance P, which in contrast competes very well for binding with both NKA and septide.",FEBS letters,1996
17587057,Sequence variants in the genes for the interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) and its ligand (IL12B) confer protection against psoriasis.,"Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disorder that is inherited as a multifactorial trait. Genetic analyses have repeatedly identified a primary disease susceptibility locus lying within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), on chromosome 6p21. A small number of non-MHC susceptibility loci have also been identified. These regions tend to overlap with susceptibility intervals for Crohn's disease and atopic dermatitis, suggesting the possibility that genetic variants affecting inflammatory pathways may contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple disorders. Here, we report a genetic analysis of the interleukin 23 receptor gene (IL23R), which was recently identified as a susceptibility determinant for Crohn's disease. We initially examined the results of a whole-genome association scan, carried out on 318 cases and 288 controls. We observed a significant increase of a non-synonymous substitution (p.Arg381Gln) among controls (P = 0.00036). We validated this finding by extending our cohort to include a further 519 cases and 528 controls. In the overall sample, the frequency of the 381Gln allele was 3.6% in cases and 7% in controls, yielding a P value of 0.00014. Next, we examined genetic variation at the IL12RB1, IL23A and IL12B genes, respectively, encoding the second subunit of the IL23R receptor and the two subunits of its ligand. This analysis identified independent associations for IL12B SNPs rs10045431 (P value for the extended dataset = 0.0001) and rs3212227 (P = 0.036). Altogether, these findings indicate that genes participating in IL23 signalling play a significant role in the pathogenesis of chronic epithelial inflammation.",,
30230528,Sertad1 promotes prostate cancer progression through binding androgen receptor ligand binding domain.,"Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is involved in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer (PCa), which is the most frequently diagnosed nonskin cancer and remains a leading cause of cancer-related death in men. Further investigation of the involvement of AR signaling in PCa progression is urgently needed. In the present study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and demonstrated that SERTA domain-containing protein 1 (Sertad1) is a novel AR-binding protein that binds to the AR ligand binding domain (LBD). The binding between AR-LBD and Sertad1 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation (IP) and confocal immunofluorescence co-localization experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DHT inhibited Sertad1 protein degradation in prostate cancer cell lines and that Sertad1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro. In human PCa tumor tissues, Sertad1 expression is positively correlated with AR expression and the Gleason score. Taken together, this report is the first to show that Sertad1 is a novel AR-LBD-binding protein, and DHT-liganded AR-LBD inhibits Sertad1 degradation. Thus, Sertad1 may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AR-positive PCa.",International journal of cancer,2019
7906861,Serum alpha 2-HS-glycoprotein is an inhibitor of the human insulin receptor at the tyrosine kinase level.,"The insulin-dependent tyrosine kinase activity (TKA) of the insulin receptor (IR) plays an essential role in insulin signaling. Thus, dysregulation of IR-TKA might be an important element in the states of insulin resistance. A phosphorylated rat hepatic glycoprotein (pp63) acting as an inhibitor of IR-TK has been described. In search of the human homolog of pp63, we isolated a cDNA clone from a human liver lambda gt11 cDNA library. DNA sequence analysis reveals identity with the mRNA product of a human gene AHSG encoding a serum protein, alpha 2-Heremans Scmid-glycoprotein (alpha 2HSG), with heretofore unknown physiological function. Northern blot analysis demonstrates a 1.8-kilobase mRNA in human liver and HepG2 hepatoma cells. alpha 2HSG, purified from human serum, specifically inhibits insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation in vitro and in vivo as well as exogenous substrate tyrosine phosphorylation. alpha 2HSG also inhibits both insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the association of IRS-1 with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase in H-35 hepatoma cells. alpha 2HSG inhibits insulin-dependent mitogenesis, but does not affect insulin-stimulated induction of the metabolic enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase. alpha 2HSG does not compete with insulin for binding to IR. Finally, the action of alpha 2HSG is specific toward the IR-TK; its effect does not extend to insulin-like growth factor-I-stimulated TKA. Our results allow us to assign a biochemical function for human alpha 2HSG, namely regulation of insulin action at the IR-TK level.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",1993
15561721,Serum amyloid A is a ligand for scavenger receptor class B type I and inhibits high density lipoprotein binding and selective lipid uptake.,"Serum amyloid A is an acute phase protein that is carried in the plasma largely as an apolipoprotein of high density lipoprotein (HDL). In this study we investigated whether SAA is a ligand for the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and how SAA may influence SR-BI-mediated HDL binding and selective cholesteryl ester uptake. Studies using Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing SR-BI showed that (125)I-labeled SAA, both in lipid-free form and in reconstituted HDL particles, functions as a high affinity ligand for SR-BI. SAA also bound with high affinity to the hepatocyte cell line, HepG2. Alexa-labeled SAA was shown by fluorescence confocal microscopy to be internalized by cells in a SR-BI-dependent manner. To assess how SAA association with HDL influences HDL interaction with SR-BI, SAA-containing HDL was isolated from mice overexpressing SAA through adenoviral gene transfer. SAA presence on HDL had little effect on HDL binding to SR-BI but decreased (30-50%) selective cholesteryl ester uptake. Lipid-free SAA, unlike lipid-free apoA-I, was an effective inhibitor of both SR-BI-dependent binding and selective cholesteryl ester uptake of HDL. We have concluded that SR-BI plays a key role in SAA metabolism through its ability to interact with and internalize SAA and, further, that SAA influences HDL cholesterol metabolism through its inhibitory effects on SR-BI-mediated selective lipid uptake.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2005

23858030,Serum amyloid A3 binds MD-2 to activate p38 and NF-κB pathways in a MyD88-dependent manner.,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) 3 is a major component of the acute phase of inflammation. We previously reported that SAA3 served as an endogenous peptide ligand for TLR4 to facilitate lung metastasis. Because these experiments were performed with SAA3 recombinant proteins purified from Escherichia coli or mammalian cells, we could not rule out the possibility of LPS contamination. In this study, we used SAA3 synthetic peptides to eliminate the presence of LPS in SAA3. We found that the SAA3 synthetic peptide (aa 20-86) (20-86) stimulated cell migration and activated p38 in a manner dependent on TLR4, MD-2, and MyD88. SAA3 (20-86) also activated NF-κB and Rho small GTPase. Using surface plasmon resonance analysis, the binding constant KD values between SAA3 (20-86) or SAA3 (43-57) and TLR4/MD-2 protein highly purified by the baculovirus system were 2.2 and 30 μM, respectively. FLAG-tagged SAA3 tightly bound to protein A-tagged MD-2, but not to TLR4 in baculovirus coinfection experiments. Although SAA3 (20-86) caused a low, but appreciable level of endocytosis in TLR4, it induced the upregulation of both IL-6 and TNF-α, but not IFN-β1. An i.v. injection of SAA3 (43-57) induced the lung recruitment of CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) cells at an estimated serum concentration around its KD value toward TLR4/MD-2. Taken together, these results suggest that SAA3 directly binds MD-2 and activates the MyD88-dependent TLR4/MD-2 pathway.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2013
29979633,SFRP3 negatively regulates placental extravillous trophoblast cell migration mediated by the GCM1-WNT10B-FZD7 axis.,"Migration of placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells into uterine decidua facilitates the establishment of blood circulation between mother and fetus and is modulated by EVT-decidual cell interaction. Poor or excessive EVT migration is associated with pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia or placenta accreta. Glial cells missing 1 (GCM1) transcription factor is essential for placental development, and decreased GCM1 activity is detected in preeclampsia. To study whether GCM1 regulates trophoblast cell migration, here we showed that GCM1 promotes BeWo and JAR trophoblast cell migration through a novel target gene, WNT10B. Moreover, WNT10B signaling stimulated cytoskeletal remodeling via Rac1 and frizzled 7 (FZD7) was identified as the cognate receptor for WNT10B to up-regulate cell migration. We further showed that secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (SFRP3) is expressed in uterine decidual cells by immunohistochemistry and that SFRP3 expression in telomerase-transformed human endometrial stromal cells (T-HESCs) is elevated under decidualization stimuli and further enhanced by bone morphogenetic protein 2 via SMAD1. SFRP3 blocked the interaction between FZD7 and WNT10B to decrease BeWo cell migration, which corroborated the elevated BeWo cell migration when cocultured with decidualized and SFRP3-knockdown T-HESC monolayer. Our results suggest that GCM1 up-regulates EVT cell migration through WNT10B and FZD7, which is negatively modulated by decidual SFRP3.-Wang, L.-J., Lo, H.-F., Lin, C.-F., Ng, P.-S., Wu, Y.-H., Lee, Y.-S., Cheong, M.-L., Chen, H.

10318834,Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide.,"We have shown previously that Phe93 in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) is crucial for binding EPO. Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.",,
10641437,Sharing of receptor subunits and signal transduction pathway between the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor system.,"In this review, we summarize the subunit structure of the interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 receptor system and the molecular mechanism of signals through the cytokine receptor systems. We have demonstrated that two different forms of IL-4R exist, classical and alternative. Classical IL-4R is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and consists of IL-4R p140 (beta) and IL-2R gamma (gamma c) chains. The alternative form of IL-4R is predominantly expressed in nonhematopoietic cells and consists of IL-4R beta and IL-13R alpha' chains. Moreover, the alternative form of IL-4R is also used as a functional component in the IL-13R complex. For signal transduction through IL-4R and IL-13R, we have demonstrated that in nonhematopoietic cells, Janus protein tyrosine kinase (JAK) 2 is phosphorylated and activated instead of JAK3 tyrosine kinase. While JAK3 is required for signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT6) activation in hematopoietic cells, we recently demonstrated that in nonhematopoietic cells JAK2 is required for STAT6 activation for the alternative form of IL-4R. Thus, a major difference exists between hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells with regard to structure and signal transduction through the IL-4R and IL-13R systems.",International journal of hematology,1999
23447688,Shear stress-dependent downregulation of the adhesion-G protein-coupled receptor CD97 on circulating leukocytes upon contact with its ligand CD55.,"Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are two-subunit molecules, consisting of an adhesive extracellular α subunit that couples noncovalently to a seven-transmembrane β subunit. The cooperation between the two subunits and the effect of endogenous ligands on the functioning of aGPCRs is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the interaction between the pan-leukocyte aGPCR CD97 and its ligand CD55. We found that leukocytes from CD55-deficient mice express significantly increased levels of cell surface CD97 that normalized after transfer into wild-type mice because of contact with CD55 on both leukocytes and stromal cells. Downregulation of both CD97 subunits occurred within minutes after first contact with CD55 in vivo, which correlated with an increase in plasma levels of soluble CD97. In vitro, downregulation of CD97 on CD55-deficient leukocytes cocultured with wild-type blood cells was strictly dependent on shear stress. In vivo, CD55-mediated downregulation of CD97 required an intact circulation and was not observed on cells that lack contact with the blood stream, such as microglia. Notably, de novo ligation of CD97 did not activate signaling molecules constitutively engaged by CD97 in cancer cells, such as ERK and protein kinase B/Akt. We conclude that CD55 downregulates CD97 surface expression on circulating leukocytes by a process that requires physical forces, but based on current evidence does not induce receptor signaling. This regulation can restrict CD97-CD55-mediated cell adhesion to tissue sites.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2013
1377218,Short amino acid sequences derived from C1q receptor (C1q-R) show homology with the alpha chains of fibronectin and vitronectin receptors and collagen type IV.,"The human C1q receptor (C1q-R) is a 65-70-kd, highly acidic, hydrophobic glycoprotein that is expressed on a wide variety of cell surfaces. Although the C1q-R itself appears to bind preferentially to C1q, the region of the ligand to which C1q-R binds is the primary binding site for several other molecules, including fibronectin, laminin, and C1q inhibitor (chondroitin 4-sulfate proteoglycan) as well as the complement C1r2C1s2 tetramer. In order to further characterize the C1q-R molecule with regard to its structure and function, highly purified C1q-R was obtained from Raji cells using DEAE-Sephacel and C1q-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography. Studies performed with 125I-labeled C1q-R demonstrated that whereas the C1q-R molecule binds poorly to a variety of human collagens including types II, III, and V, markedly enhanced binding is observed with type IV collagen and moderately enhanced binding with type I collagen. Amino acid composition studies show that the C1q-R molecule contains approximately 44% hydrophobic and 12.6% hydrophilic residues with a ratio of negatively charged to positively charged residues of about 2:1. Treatment of 125I-labeled C1q-R with endoglycosidase F lowers the apparent molecular size from 70 to 58 kd, whereas endoglycosidase H lowered the size to 64 kd. Treatment with neuraminidase, on the other hand, shifted the size of C1q-R to 60 kd. These results suggest the presence of several highly sialylated complex-type or high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Because purified C1q-R has a blocked amino terminus, amino acid sequences representing internal fragments of the molecule were generated by electroblotting and in situ enzymatic digestion. When these short sequences were searched against the National Biomedical Research Foundation computer data base, a seven-amino-acid sequence, VSWQGQI, showed significant homology (100% and 80% in a five-amino-acid overlap, respectively) with the alpha chains of the human fibronectin (alpha 5 beta 1) and vitronectin (alpha v beta 3) receptors, and to a lesser degree with epidermal growth factor receptor and T cell receptor. A second sequence, ISEDNIR, showed homology with mouse collagen type IV (86% in a six-amino-acid overlap), calmodulin (60% in a seven-amino-acid overlap), and a Leishmania major surface antigen, gp63. These observations seem to predict that C1q-R has pockets of conserved sequences that are similar to those not only present in its ligand(s) but also in other cell surface receptors that may, in part, fulfill similar functions.",,
11478907,Short segment of human melanin-concentrating hormone that is sufficient for full activation of human melanin-concentrating hormone receptors 1 and 2.,"Human melanin-concentrating hormone (hMCH) is a potent but nonselective agonist at human melanin-concentrating hormone receptors 1 and 2 (hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R, respectively). To determine the structural features of this neuropeptide which are necessary for efficient binding to and activation of the receptors, Ala-substituted, open-chain, and truncated analogues were synthesized and tested in the binding assays in CHO cells expressing hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R, and in functional assays measuring the level of intracellular calcium mobilization in human HEK-293 cells expressing these receptors. A compound consisting merely of the cyclic core of hMCH with the Arg attached to the N-terminus of the disulfide ring was found to activate both hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R about as effectively as full-length hMCH. Thus, the sequence Arg-cyclo(S-S)(Cys-Met-Leu-Gly-Arg-Val-Tyr-Arg-Pro-Cys) appears to constitute the ""active core"" that is necessary for agonist potency at hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R. A potent and approximately 4-fold more selective agonist at hMCH-1R than at hMCH-2R is also reported.",,
16326706,Shp-1 mediates the antiproliferative activity of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 in human microvascular endothelial cells.,"The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) regulate matrix metalloproteinase activity required for cell migration/invasion associated with cancer progression and angiogenesis. TIMPs also modulate cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo independent of their matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory activity. Here, we show that TIMP-2 mediates G1 growth arrest in human endothelial cells through de novo synthesis of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. TIMP-2-mediated inhibition of Cdk4 and Cdk2 activity is associated with increased binding of p27Kip1 to these complexes in vivo. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors or expression of a dominant negative Shp-1 mutant ablates TIMP-2 induction of p27Kip1. Finally, angiogenic responses to fibroblast growth factor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor-A in ""motheaten viable"" Shp-1-deficient mice are resistant to TIMP-2 inhibition, demonstrating that Shp-1 is an important negative regulator of angiogenesis in vivo.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2006
7883784,Signal transduction by the macrophage-colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1R).,"The macrophage-specific colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1 or M-CSF) is required throughout the G1 phase of the cell cycle to regulate both immediate and delayed early responses necessary for cell proliferation. These are triggered by the binding of the growth factor to the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor and the activation of its intrinsic tyrosine-specific protein kinase. Phosphorylation of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor on specific tyrosine residues enables it to bind directly to cytoplasmic effector proteins, which in turn relay receptor-induced signals through multiple-signal transduction pathways. The activity of p21ras as well as transcription factors of the ets gene family appears to be required for colony-stimulating factor 1 to induce the c-myc gene, and the latter response is essential to ensure cell proliferation. Genes within the fos/jun or activator protein 1 family are targeted via a parallel and independently regulated signal transduction pathway. The continuous requirement for colony-stimulating factor 1 after the immediate early response is initiated indicates that expression of additional delayed early response genes, although contingent on previously induced gene products, might also depend on colony-stimulating factor 1-induced signals. Among the growth factor-regulated delayed early response genes are D-type G1 cyclins, which play an important role in cell-cycle progression.",Journal of cell science. Supplement,1994
12709393,"Signaling and distribution of NPR-Bi, the human splice form of the natriuretic peptide receptor type B.","Recently, we described a splice variant of the human natriuretic peptide receptor type B (NPR-Bi) in human proximal tubule cells [immortalized human kidney epithelial cells (IHKE-1) that lacks a functional guanylate cyclase domain (Hirsch JR, Meyer M, Mägert HJ, Forssmann WG, Mollerup S, Herter P, Weber G, Cermak R, Ankorina-Stark I, Schlatter E, and Kruhøffer M. J Am Soc Nephrol 10: 472-480, 1999). Its signaling pathway does not include cGMP, cAMP, or Ca2+ but leads to inhibition of K+ channels. In patch-clamp experiments, effects of tyrosine kinase receptor blockers on C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP)-mediated depolarizations of membrane voltages (Vm) of IHKE-1 cells were tested. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor blocker genistein (10 microM) abolished the effect of CNP (0.2 +/- 0.4 mV, n = 7), and comparable results were obtained with 10 microM daidzein (n = 8). Aminogenistein (10 microM, n = 5) and tyrphostin AG1295 (10 microM, n = 5) had no significant effects. EGF (1 nM) hyperpolarized cells by -5.3 +/- 0.8 mV (n = 5). This effect was completely blocked by genistein or daidzein. The Cl- channel blocker NPPB (10 microM, n = 5) inhibited the EGF-mediated hyperpolarization. mRNA expression of NPR-B and NPR-Bi shows reversed patterns along the human nephron. NPR-B is highly expressed in glomeruli and proximal tubules, whereas NPR-Bi shows strong signals in the distal nephron. Expression of NPR-Bi in the cortical collecting duct was also confirmed with immunohistochemistry. In other human tissues, NPR-Bi shows strongest expression in pancreas and lung, whereas in the heart and liver NPR-B is the dominating receptor. In conclusion, CNP inhibits an apical K+ channel in IHKE-1 cells independently of cGMP and so far this effect can only be blocked by genistein and daidzein. Tyrosine phosphorylation might be the missing link in the signaling pathway of CNP/NPR-Bi.",American journal of physiology. Renal physiology,2003
15331768,Signaling and ligand binding by recombinant neuromedin U receptors: evidence for dual coupling to Galphaq/11 and Galphai and an irreversible ligand-receptor interaction.,"The neuropeptide neuromedin U (NmU) shows considerable structural conservation across species. Within the body, it is widely distributed and in mammals has been implicated in physiological roles, including the regulation of feeding, anxiety, pain, blood flow, and smooth muscle contraction. Human NmU-25 (hNmU-25) and other NmU analogs were recently identified as ligands for two human orphan G protein-coupled receptors, subsequently named hNmU-R1 and hNmU-R2. These receptors have approximately 50% amino acid homology, and, at least in mammalian species, NmU-R1 and NmU-R2 are expressed predominantly in the periphery and central nervous system, respectively. Here, we have characterized signaling mediated by hNmU-R1 and hNmU-R2 expressed as recombinant proteins in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, particularly to define their G protein coupling and the activation and regulation of signal transduction pathways. We show that these receptors couple to both Galpha(q/11) and Galpha(i). Activation of either receptor type causes a pertussis toxin-insensitive activation of both phospholipase C and mitogen activated-protein kinase and a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with subnanomolar potency for each. Activation of phospholipase C is sustained, but despite this capacity for prolonged receptor activation, repetitive application of hNmU-25 does not cause repetitive intracellular Ca2+ signaling by either recombinant receptors or those expressed endogenously in isolated smooth muscle cells from rat fundus. Using several strategies, we show this to be a consequence of essentially irreversible binding of hNmU-25 to its receptors and that this is followed by ligand internalization. Despite structural differences between receptors, there were no apparent differences in their activation, coupling, or regulation.",Molecular pharmacology,2004
22087031,Signaling by the matrix proteoglycan decorin controls inflammation and cancer through PDCD4 and MicroRNA-21.,"The mechanisms linking immune responses and inflammation with tumor development are not well understood. Here, we show that the soluble form of the extracellular matrix proteoglycan decorin controls inflammation and tumor growth through PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4) and miR-21 (microRNA-21) by two mechanisms. First, decorin acted as an endogenous ligand of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 and stimulated production of proinflammatory molecules, including PDCD4, in macrophages. Second, decorin prevented translational repression of PDCD4 by decreasing the activity of transforming growth factor-β1 and the abundance of oncogenic miR-21, a translational inhibitor of PDCD4. Moreover, increased PDCD4 abundance led to decreased release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, thereby making the cytokine profile more proinflammatory. This pathway operates in both pathogen-mediated and sterile inflammation, as shown here for sepsis and growth retardation of established tumor xenografts, respectively. Decorin was an early response gene evoked by septic inflammation, and protein concentrations of decorin were increased in the plasma of septic patients and mice. In cancer, decorin reduced the abundance of anti-inflammatory molecules and increased that of proinflammatory molecules, thereby shifting the immune response to a proinflammatory state associated with reduced tumor growth. Thus, by stimulating proinflammatory PDCD4 and decreasing the abundance of miR-21, decorin signaling boosts inflammatory activity in sepsis and suppresses tumor growth.",Science signaling,2011
10969083,Signaling from E-cadherins to the MAPK pathway by the recruitment and activation of epidermal growth factor receptors upon cell-cell contact formation.,"E-cadherins are well characterized cell surface molecules expressed in epithelial cells, which play a major role in cell adhesion through the establishment of calcium-dependent homophilic interactions at sites of cell-cell contacts. They are also integral components of morphogenetic programs controlling the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of epithelia. Accumulated evidence indicates that the E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion system is highly regulated from inside the cells by a number of intracellular signaling pathways. Recently available information suggests that E-cadherins may also play a role in the transduction of signals from the outside of the cell to the cytoplasm. However, the nature of the biochemical routes regulated by E-cadherins is still largely unknown. In this study, we set out to explore the possibility that E-cadherins may regulate the activity of MAPK, a key signaling pathway involved in cell fate decisions, upon the formation of cell-cell contacts among neighboring cells. By using an immortalized non-tumorigenic keratinocyte cell line, HaCat, as a model system, we provide evidence that the assembly of calcium-dependent adherens junctions leads to a rapid and remarkable increase in the state of activation of MAPK and that this event is mediated by E-cadherins. Furthermore, we found that E-cadherins stimulate the MAPK pathway through the ligand-independent activation of epidermal growth factor receptors and the consequent activation of a biochemical route leading to the stimulation of MAPKs. These findings suggest that E-cadherins can initiate outside-in signal transducing pathways through the engagement of tyrosine kinase receptors for epidermal growth factor, thus providing a novel molecular mechanism whereby these cell adhesion molecules may ultimately control the fate of normal and transformed epithelial cells.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000

12643274,Signaling of human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) revisited. The interleukin-6 receptor can serve as an alpha-receptor for CTNF.,"Human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a neurotrophic cytokine that exerts a neuroprotective effect in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Clinical application of human CNTF, however, was prevented by high toxicity at higher dosages. Human CNTF elicits cellular responses by induction of a receptor complex consisting of the CNTF alpha-receptor (CNTFR), which is not involved in signal transduction, and the beta-receptors gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Previous studies with rat CNTF demonstrated that rat CNTF is unable to interact with the human interleukin-6 alpha-receptor, whereas at high concentrations, it can directly induce a signaling heterodimer of human gp130 and human LIFR in the absence of the CNTF receptor. Here, we demonstrate that human CNTF cannot directly induce a heterodimer of human gp130 and LIFR. However, human CNTF can use both the membrane-bound and the soluble human IL-6R as a substitute for its cognate alpha-receptor and thus widen the target spectrum of human CNTF. Engineering a CNTFR-specific human CNTF variant may therefore be a prerequisite to improving the safety profile of CNTF.",,
11294841,Signaling pathways recruited by the cardiotrophin-like cytokine/cytokine-like factor-1 composite cytokine: specific requirement of the membrane-bound form of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha component.,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a cytokine supporting the differentiation and survival of a number of neural cell types. Its receptor complex consists of a ligand-binding component, CNTF receptor (CNTFR), associated with two signaling receptor components, gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Striking phenotypic differences between CNTF- and CNTFR-deficient mice suggest that CNTFR serves as a receptor for a second developmentally important ligand. We recently demonstrated that cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) associates with the soluble orphan receptor cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF) to form a heterodimeric cytokine that displayed activities only on cells expressing the tripartite CNTF receptor on their surface. In this present study we examined the membrane binding of the CLC/CLF composite cytokine and observed a preferential interaction of the cytokine with the CNTFR subunit. Signaling pathways recruited by the CLC/CLF complex in human neuroblastoma cell lines were also analyzed in detail. The results obtained showed an activation of Janus kinases (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2) leading to a tyrosine phosphorylation of the gp130 and LIFR. The phosphorylated signaling receptors served in turn as docking proteins for signal transducing molecules such as STAT3 and SHP-2. In vitro analysis revealed that the gp130-LIFR pathway could also stimulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In contrast to that reported before for CNTF, soluble CNTFR failed to promote the action CLC/CLF, and an absolute requirement of the membrane form of CNTFR was required to generate a functional response to the composite cytokine. This study reinforces the functional similarity between CNTF and the CLC/CLF composite cytokine defining the second ligand for CNTFR.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
9521070,Signaling through human killer cell activating receptors triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of an associated protein complex.,"Our understanding of the biology of human natural killer (NK) cells has significantly advanced in recent years upon identification of a family of NK cell-expressed genes that encode killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIR). Individual KIR can selectively bind various HLA class I allotypes and consequently transduce inhibitory signals that block NK cell lysis of ligand-bearing target cells. A distinct subset of related and linked genes express truncated versions of KIR that are otherwise highly homologous in amino acid sequence. Interestingly, these receptors appear to transmit stimulatory signals into NK cells and have been termed killer cell activating receptors (KAR). In this report, we demonstrate that recognition of HLA-Cw3 by the p50 KAR, NKAT8, can potentiate the cytotoxic response of appropriate NK cell clones. Specific cross-linking of this KAR with a monoclonal antibody resulted in intracellular calcium mobilization, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of the MAP kinases, ERK1 and ERK2. In addition, we identified a KAR-associated disulfide-linked dimer of a 13-kDa protein that was absent in the Jurkat T cell line and is predicted to participate in these activation signaling events. Upon treatment of NK cells with pervanadate, the disulfide-linked p13 and additional proteins of 25, 30, 37 and 50-95 kDa were identified as KAR-associated tyrosine phosphoproteins. Importantly, p13 was inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated upon cross-linking of NKAT8, which strongly suggests that the associated p13 provides KAR with appropriate cytoplasmic structure to couple with tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling effectors.",European journal of immunology,1998
10188995,"Signalling by CXC-chemokine receptors 1 and 2 expressed in CHO cells: a comparison of calcium mobilization, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and stimulation of GTPgammaS binding induced by IL-8 and GROalpha.","The effect of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and growth-related oncogene alpha (GROalpha) on [35S]-guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) ([35S]GTPgammaS) binding, forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation and cytosolic calcium concentration were determined in recombinant CHO cells expressing HA-tagged CXC-chemokine receptors 1 and 2 (CXCR1 and CXCR2). Radioligand binding assays confirmed that the binding profiles of the recombinant receptors were similar to those of the native proteins. IL-8 displaced [125I]-IL-8 binding to CXCR1 and CXCR2 with pKi values of 8.89+/-0.05 and 9.27+/-0.03, respectively. GROalpha, a selective CXCR2 ligand, had a pKi value of 9.66+/-0.39 at CXCR2 but a pKi>8 at CXCR1. Calcium mobilization experiments were also consistent with previous reports on native receptors. Activation of both receptors resulted in stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. A comparison of the functional data at CXCRI showed that a similar potency order (IL-8> >GROalpha) was obtained in all three assays. However, at CXCR2 whilst the potency orders for calcium mobilization and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase were similar (IL-8 > or = GROalpha), the order was reversed for stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding (GROalpha > IL-8). All of the functional responses at both receptors were inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX), suggesting coupling to a Gi/Go protein. However, the calcium mobilization induced by IL-8 at CXCR1 was not fully inhibited by PTX, suggesting an interaction with a G-protein of the Gq family. Our results with pertussis toxin also suggested that, in the [35S]GTPgammaS binding assay, CXCR1 displays some constitutive activity. Thus, we have characterized the binding and several functional responses at HA-tagged CXCRs 1 and 2 and have shown that their pharmacology agrees well with that of the native receptors. We also have preliminary evidence that CXCR1 displays constitutive activity in our cell line and that CXCR2 may traffic between different PTX sensitive G-proteins.",,

7679912,Similarities and differences in the way neurotrophins interact with the Trk receptors in neuronal and nonneuronal cells.,"We have exploited a battery of approaches to address several controversies that have accompanied the expansion of the nerve growth factor (NGF) family of neurotrophic factors and the identification of the Trk tyrosine kinases as receptors for these factors. For example, we find that a recently cloned mammalian neurotrophin, known as either neurotrophin-4 or neurotrophin-5 and assigned widely differing receptor specificities, represents the functional counterpart of Xenopus neurotrophin-4 and is a ""preferred"" ligand for TrkB. However, its interactions with TrkB can be distinguished from those of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with TrkB. We also find that all of the Trks display similar dose responses to their ""preferred"" ligands in neuronal as compared with nonneuronal cells (i.e., NGF for TrkA, BDNF and NT-4/5 for TrkB, and NT-3 for TrkC), providing evidence against a role for accessory molecules expressed in neurons in generating receptors that would allow for responses to lower concentrations of the neurotrophins. However, we find that a neuronal environment does restrict the Trks in their ability to respond to their ""nonpreferred"" neurotrophin ligands.",,
29212879,Single-molecule measurements of the effect of force on Thy-1/αvβ3-integrin interaction using nonpurified proteins.,"Thy-1 and αvβ3 integrin mediate bidirectional cell-to-cell communication between neurons and astrocytes. Thy-1/αvβ3 interactions stimulate astrocyte migration and the retraction of neuronal prolongations, both processes in which internal forces are generated affecting the bimolecular interactions that maintain cell-cell adhesion. Nonetheless, how the Thy-1/αvβ3 interactions respond to mechanical cues is an unresolved issue. In this study, optical tweezers were used as a single-molecule force transducer, and the Dudko-Hummer-Szabo model was applied to calculate the kinetic parameters of Thy-1/αvβ3 dissociation. A novel experimental strategy was implemented to analyze the interaction of Thy-1-Fc with nonpurified αvβ3-Fc integrin, whereby nonspecific rupture events were corrected by using a new mathematical approach. This methodology permitted accurately estimating specific rupture forces for Thy-1-Fc/αvβ3-Fc dissociation and calculating the kinetic and transition state parameters. Force exponentially accelerated Thy-1/αvβ3 dissociation, indicating slip bond behavior. Importantly, nonspecific interactions were detected even for purified proteins, highlighting the importance of correcting for such interactions. In conclusion, we describe a new strategy to characterize the response of bimolecular interactions to forces even in the presence of nonspecific binding events. By defining how force regulates Thy-1/αvβ3 integrin binding, we provide an initial step towards understanding how the neuron-astrocyte pair senses and responds to mechanical cues.",,

We investigated here human VIP1 and VIP2 receptors by mutating in their extracellular domains all amino acid residues that are conserved in VIP receptors but are different in other members of their subfamily. They are present in 1) the N-terminal domain, i.e., E36, I43, S64, D132 and F138 in the VIP1 receptor and E24, I31, S53, D116 and F122 in the VIP2 receptor; 2) the second extracellular loop, i.e., T288 and S292 in the VIP1 receptor and T274 and S278 in the VIP2 receptor. These residues were changed to alanine (A), and cDNAs were transfected into Cos cells. For the VIP1 receptor, no specific 125I-VIP binding could be detected in cells transfected with the E36A mutant, whereas other mutants exhibited Kd values similar to that of the wild-type receptor, with the exception of S64A, for which a 3-fold increase of Kd was observed. For the VIP2 receptor, no specific 125I-VIP binding could be observed with the E24A mutant, whereas other mutants exhibited dissociation constants similar to that of the wild-type receptor, with the exception of I31A and T274A mutants, for which a 11- and 5-fold increase of Kd was observed, respectively. cAMP production experiments provided evidence that the E36A VIP1 receptor and the E24A VIP2 receptor mutants mediated almost no response upon VIP exposure. For the I31A and T274A mutants of the VIP2 receptor and the S64A mutant of the VIP1 receptor, the EC50 values of VIP for stimulating cAMP production were increased 35, 8 and 3 times as compared with that observed for the wild-type receptor, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that all mutants were normally expressed by Cos cells. These data provide the first evidence for differences in the structure-function relationship of VIP1 and VIP2 receptors.",,
7918378,Site-specific conjugation to interleukin 4 containing mutated cysteine residues produces interleukin 4-toxin conjugates with improved binding and activity.,"Fusion of a ligand to another protein frequently impairs the binding of the ligand. Recombinant toxins composed of mutants of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) fused to the C-terminus of human interleukin 4 (IL4) are cytotoxic to IL4 receptor- (IL4R-) bearing tumor cells but bind to the IL4R with only 1% the affinity of IL4. We have developed a method to connect a toxin to a ligand which allows the junction to be moved to a location on the ligand which would minimize the binding impairment. We designed mutants of IL4 in which residue 28, 38, 68, 70, 97, or 105 was substituted with cysteine. All purified mutants bound to the IL4R with 60-100% the affinity of IL4, indicating that the IL4 structure was essentially unchanged. The IL4 mutants were then each conjugated through a disulfide bond to PE35, a truncated form of PE which contains a single cysteine. IL4 conjugated to PE35 at residue 28, 38, or 105 of IL4 bound with 10-fold improved affinity and was 10-fold more cytotoxic than the recombinant IL4-toxin in which PE is fused to position 129 at the C-terminus of IL4. IL4 containing PE35 conjugated at position 68, 70, or 97 had lower binding affinity and cytotoxic activity. These results indicate that the location of the ligand-protein junction can be selectively moved to enhance conjugate effectiveness, and implications could be made regarding which regions of IL4 are important for binding.",Biochemistry,1994

10102268,Slit proteins bind Robo receptors and have an evolutionarily conserved role in repulsive axon guidance.,"Extending axons in the developing nervous system are guided in part by repulsive cues. Genetic analysis in Drosophila, reported in a companion to this paper, identifies the Slit protein as a candidate ligand for the repulsive guidance receptor Roundabout (Robo). Here we describe the characterization of three mammalian Slit homologs and show that the Drosophila Slit protein and at least one of the mammalian Slit proteins, Slit2, are proteolytically processed and show specific, high-affinity binding to Robo proteins. Furthermore, recombinant Slit2 can repel embryonic spinal motor axons in cell culture. These results support the hypothesis that Slit proteins have an evolutionarily conserved role in axon guidance as repulsive ligands for Robo receptors.",Cell,1999
15130495,SLIT2-mediated ROBO2 signaling restricts kidney induction to a single site.,"Kidney development occurs in a stereotypic position along the body axis. It begins when a single ureteric bud emerges from the nephric duct in response to GDNF secreted by the adjacent nephrogenic mesenchyme. Posterior restriction of Gdnf expression is considered critical for correct positioning of ureteric bud development. Here we show that mouse mutants lacking either SLIT2 or its receptor ROBO2, molecules known primarily for their function in axon guidance and cell migration, develop supernumerary ureteric buds that remain inappropriately connected to the nephric duct, and that the SLIT2/ROBO2 signal is transduced in the nephrogenic mesenchyme. Furthermore, we show that Gdnf expression is inappropriately maintained in anterior nephrogenic mesenchyme in these mutants. Thus our data identify an intercellular signaling system that restricts, directly or indirectly, the extent of the Gdnf expression domain, thereby precisely positioning the site of kidney induction.",,
26004511,Slitrk5 Mediates BDNF-Dependent TrkB Receptor Trafficking and Signaling.,"Recent studies in humans and in genetic mouse models have identified Slit- and NTRK-like family (Slitrks) as candidate genes for neuropsychiatric disorders. All Slitrk isotypes are highly expressed in the CNS, where they mediate neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and neuronal survival. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these functions are not known. Here, we report that Slitrk5 modulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent biological responses through direct interaction with TrkB receptors. Under basal conditions, Slitrk5 interacts primarily with a transsynaptic binding partner, protein tyrosine phosphatase δ (PTPδ); however, upon BDNF stimulation, Slitrk5 shifts to cis-interactions with TrkB. In the absence of Slitrk5, TrkB has a reduced rate of ligand-dependent recycling and altered responsiveness to BDNF treatment. Structured illumination microscopy revealed that Slitrk5 mediates optimal targeting of TrkB receptors to Rab11-positive recycling endosomes through recruitment of a Rab11 effector protein, Rab11-FIP3. Thus, Slitrk5 acts as a TrkB co-receptor that mediates its BDNF-dependent trafficking and signaling.",Developmental cell,2015
23345436,Slitrks control excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation with LAR receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases.,"The balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, which is governed by multiple synapse organizers, controls neural circuit functions and behaviors. Slit- and Trk-like proteins (Slitrks) are a family of synapse organizers, whose emerging synaptic roles are incompletely understood. Here, we report that Slitrks are enriched in postsynaptic densities in rat brains. Overexpression of Slitrks promoted synapse formation, whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of Slitrks decreased synapse density. Intriguingly, Slitrks were required for both excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation in an isoform-dependent manner. Moreover, Slitrks required distinct members of the leukocyte antigen-related receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (LAR-RPTP) family to trigger synapse formation. Protein tyrosine phosphatase σ (PTPσ), in particular, was specifically required for excitatory synaptic differentiation by Slitrks, whereas PTPδ was necessary for inhibitory synapse differentiation. Taken together, these data suggest that combinatorial interactions of Slitrks with LAR-RPTP family members maintain synapse formation to coordinate excitatory-inhibitory balance.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2013
7680037,Soluble c-kit proteins and antireceptor monoclonal antibodies confine the binding site of the stem cell factor.,"The binding of the stem cell factor (SCF) to the c-kit-encoded receptor tyrosine kinase stimulates a variety of biochemical responses that culminate in cellular proliferation, migration, or survival. The extracellular domain of p145kit consists of five immunoglobulin-like domains. To confine the ligand binding site to this portion of the receptor we generated a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the Kit protein and identified two mAbs that efficiently displaced receptor-bound SCF and also inhibited proliferation of SCF-dependent human megakaryocytes. To map the epitopes of these mAbs we constructed and expressed soluble portions of the extracellular domain of Kit, which included either the two amino-terminal Ig-like domains (denoted Kit 1-2), three Ig-like domains (Kit 1-2-3), or the entire extracellular portion (Kit-X). All three recombinant proteins were recognized by the ligand inhibitory mAbs, suggesting that the SCF binding site resides in the amino-terminal half of the ecto-domain. Consistent with this conclusion, all of the soluble proteins inhibited SCF binding to Kit-expressing cells, and they also underwent specific covalent cross-linking to the radiolabeled ligand. However, whereas Kit 1-2-3 and Kit-X displayed comparable ligand affinities, deletion of the third Ig-like domain, in Kit 1-2, involved significant reduction in SCF binding. Hence, the binding site of SCF probably includes Ig-like domains 1 and 2, but structural determinants distal to this portion may also participate in ligand recognition.",,
11754357,Soluble CD30 binds to CD153 with high affinity and blocks transmembrane signaling by CD30.,"CD30 is an unusual member of the TNF receptor superfamily with a duplicated segment within its extracellular domain that may function as an additional ligand binding site. The extracellular domain of CD30 is shed from cells and soluble CD30 levels are elevated in certain disease states. Soluble CD30 may bind to its ligand, CD153, with high affinity and block its interaction with membrane-bound CD30. We have generated soluble recombinant forms of CD30 and CD153 in order to characterize their interaction and assess their biological activity. Soluble trimeric CD153 bound to membrane-anchored CD30 with a relatively high affinity (K(D)=23 nM) and was effective in triggering cell death and TNF-alpha production in the presence of cross-linking antibodies. The affinity and kinetics of the interaction between soluble CD30 and CD153 were determined using the BIAcore biosensor. In contrast to other members of the TNF receptor superfamily, soluble monomeric CD30 bound to its ligand with high affinity (K(D)=4.5 nM) and prevented the interaction of cellular CD153 with immobilized CD30. Furthermore, soluble CD30 blocked cell death signals generated by cell surface-expressed CD30 effectively. These data suggest that soluble CD30 may have biological functions in vivo.",,
22216242,Soluble CD44 interacts with intermediate filament protein vimentin on endothelial cell surface.,"CD44 is a cell surface glycoprotein that functions as hyaluronan receptor. Mouse and human serum contain substantial amounts of soluble CD44, generated either by shedding or alternative splicing. During inflammation and in cancer patients serum levels of soluble CD44 are significantly increased. Experimentally, soluble CD44 overexpression blocks cancer cell adhesion to HA. We have previously found that recombinant CD44 hyaluronan binding domain (CD44HABD) and its non-HA-binding mutant inhibited tumor xenograft growth, angiogenesis, and endothelial cell proliferation. These data suggested an additional target other than HA for CD44HABD. By using non-HA-binding CD44HABD Arg41Ala, Arg78Ser, and Tyr79Ser-triple mutant (CD443MUT) we have identified intermediate filament protein vimentin as a novel interaction partner of CD44. We found that vimentin is expressed on the cell surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Endogenous CD44 and vimentin coprecipitate from HUVECs, and when overexpressed in vimentin-negative MCF-7 cells. By using deletion mutants, we found that CD44HABD and CD443MUT bind vimentin N-terminal head domain. CD443MUT binds vimentin in solution with a Kd in range of 12-37 nM, and immobilised vimentin with Kd of 74 nM. CD443MUT binds to HUVEC and recombinant vimentin displaces CD443MUT from its binding sites. CD44HABD and CD443MUT were internalized by wild-type endothelial cells, but not by lung endothelial cells isolated from vimentin knock-out mice. Together, these data suggest that vimentin provides a specific binding site for soluble CD44 on endothelial cells.",PloS one,2011
24743304,Soluble CEACAM8 interacts with CEACAM1 inhibiting TLR2-triggered immune responses.,"Lower respiratory tract bacterial infections are characterized by neutrophilic inflammation in the airways. The carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) 8 is expressed in and released by human granulocytes. Our study demonstrates that human granulocytes release CEACAM8 in response to bacterial DNA in a TLR9-dependent manner. Individuals with a high percentage of bronchial lavage fluid (BALF) granulocytes were more likely to have detectable levels of released CEACAM8 in the BALF than those with a normal granulocyte count. Soluble, recombinant CEACAM8-Fc binds to CEACAM1 expressed on human airway epithelium. Application of CEACAM8-Fc to CEACAM1-positive human pulmonary epithelial cells resulted in reduced TLR2-dependent inflammatory responses. These inhibitory effects were accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) of CEACAM1 and by recruitment of the phosphatase SHP-1, which could negatively regulate Toll-like receptor 2-dependent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase-Akt kinase pathway. Our results suggest a new mechanism by which granulocytes reduce pro-inflammatory immune responses in human airways via secretion of CEACAM8 in neutrophil-driven bacterial infections.",,
21737454,"Soluble endoglin specifically binds bone morphogenetic proteins 9 and 10 via its orphan domain, inhibits blood vessel formation, and suppresses tumor growth.","Endoglin (CD105), a transmembrane protein of the transforming growth factor β superfamily, plays a crucial role in angiogenesis. Mutations in endoglin result in the vascular defect known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1). The soluble form of endoglin was suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. To obtain further insight into its function, we cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized the extracellular domain (ECD) of mouse and human endoglin fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain. We found that mouse and human endoglin ECD-Fc bound directly, specifically, and with high affinity to bone morphogenetic proteins 9 and 10 (BMP9 and BMP10) in surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) and cell-based assays. We performed a function mapping analysis of the different domains of endoglin by examining their contributions to the selectivity and biological activity of the protein. The BMP9/BMP10 binding site was localized to the orphan domain of human endoglin composed of the amino acid sequence 26-359. We established that endoglin and type II receptors bind to overlapping sites on BMP9. In the in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, the mouse and the truncated human endoglin ECD-Fc both significantly reduced VEGF-induced vessel formation. Finally, murine endoglin ECD-Fc acted as an anti-angiogenic factor that decreased blood vessel sprouting in VEGF/FGF-induced angiogenesis in in vivo angioreactors and reduced the tumor burden in the colon-26 mouse tumor model. Together our findings indicate an important role of soluble endoglin ECD in the regulation of angiogenesis and highlight efficacy of endoglin-Fc as a potential anti-angiogenesis therapeutic agent.",,
8049354,Soluble IL-2 receptor beta and gamma subunits: ligand binding and cooperativity.,"Biologically relevant interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2Rs) are present in two affinity states on responsive cells. High affinity receptors (HAR) apparently exist as heterotrimers (alpha, beta and gamma) while the other functional complex, the intermediate affinity receptor (IAR), is comprised of beta and gamma chains. The mechanisms by which the beta and gamma subunits contribute the formation of HAR and IAR are still unclear. Soluble forms of the beta and gamma chains were cloned, epitope-tagged, expressed in insect cells and purified. IL-2 binding and neutralization of IL-2 bioactivity by beta and gamma extracellular domains (ectodomains) was analyzed by several biochemical and biological approaches. The results indicate that beta clearly binds IL-2 with low affinity (KI-KD = 3 microM) whereas gamma binding is detectable, but of very low affinity (apparent KI > 15 microM) in the absence of beta. Interestingly, combinations of beta and gamma ectodomains interact to bind IL-2 with higher affinity and greater stability than either chain alone. An apparent stable binding complex is formed when beta, gamma, and IL-2 are combined. Ligand binding by the beta and gamma chains in solution is specific for IL-2 and is of sufficient affinity and stability to effectively neutralize IL-2 in biological assays (binding IC50 = biological IC50). Direct analyses of binding kinetics by surface plasmon resonance reveals that the increased affinity and biological neutralizing ability of beta gamma, as compared to beta, is due to a very slow dissociation rate contributed by the gamma ectodomain. While IL-2R beta and gamma cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains are not essential for interactive binding of IL-2, they may contribute to IL2 binding affinity. The recognition and association of IL-2 by the beta gamma IAR appears to be contributed primarily by the beta chain while the stability and dissociation is likely dominated by the gamma chain. It is anticipated that the gamma subunit functions in a similar manner when participating in high affinity IL-4 and IL-7 binding.",,
16284400,Soluble interleukin-15 receptor alpha (IL-15R alpha)-sushi as a selective and potent agonist of IL-15 action through IL-15R beta/gamma. Hyperagonist IL-15 x IL-15R alpha fusion proteins.,"Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is crucial for the generation of multiple lymphocyte subsets (natural killer (NK), NK-T cells, and memory CD8 T cells), and transpresentation of IL-15 by monocytes and dendritic cells has been suggested to be the dominant activating process of these lymphocytes. We have previously shown that a natural soluble form of IL-15R alpha chain corresponding to the entire extracellular domain of IL-15R alpha behaves as a high affinity IL-15 antagonist. In sharp contrast with this finding, we demonstrate in this report that a recombinant, soluble sushi domain of IL-15R alpha, which bears most of the binding affinity for IL-15, behaves as a potent IL-15 agonist by enhancing its binding and biological effects (proliferation and protection from apoptosis) through the IL-15R beta/gamma heterodimer, whereas it does not affect IL-15 binding and function of the tripartite IL-15R alpha/beta/gamma membrane receptor. Our results suggest that, if naturally produced, such soluble sushi domains might be involved in the IL-15 transpresentation mechanism. Fusion proteins (RLI and ILR), in which IL-15 and IL-15R alpha-sushi are attached by a flexible linker, are even more potent than the combination of IL-15 plus sIL-15R alpha-sushi. After binding to IL-15R beta/gamma, RLI is internalized and induces a biological response very similar to the IL-15 high affinity response. Such hyper-IL-15 fusion proteins appear to constitute potent adjuvants for the expansion of lymphocyte subsets.",,
27892504,Soluble Siglec-5 associates to PSGL-1 and displays anti-inflammatory activity.,"Interactions between endothelial selectins and the leukocyte counter-receptor PSGL1 mediates leukocyte recruitment to inflammation sites. PSGL1 is highly sialylated, making it a potential ligand for Siglec-5, a leukocyte-receptor that recognizes sialic acid structures. Binding assays using soluble Siglec-5 variants (sSiglec-5/C4BP and sSiglec-5/Fc) revealed a dose- and calcium-dependent binding to PSGL1. Pre-treatment of PSGL1 with sialidase reduced Siglec-5 binding by 79 ± 4%. In confocal immune-fluorescence assays, we observed that 50% of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) simultaneously express PSGL1 and Siglec-5. Duolink-proximity ligation analysis demonstrated that PSGL1 and Siglec-5 are in close proximity (<40 nm) in 31 ± 4% of PBMCs. In vitro perfusion assays revealed that leukocyte-rolling over E- and P-selectin was inhibited by sSiglec-5/Fc or sSiglec-5/C4BP, while adhesion onto VCAM1 was unaffected. When applied to healthy mice (0.8 mg/kg), sSiglec-5/C4BP significantly reduced the number of rolling leukocytes under basal conditions (10.9 ± 3.7 versus 23.5 ± 9.3 leukocytes/field/min for sSiglec-5/C4BP-treated and control mice, respectively; p = 0.0093). Moreover, leukocyte recruitment was inhibited over a 5-h observation period in an in vivo model of TNFalpha-induced inflammation following injection sSiglec-5/C4BP (0.8 mg/kg). Our data identify PSGL1 as a ligand for Siglec-5, and soluble Siglec-5 variants appear efficient in blocking PSGL1-mediated leukocyte rolling and the inflammatory response in general.",,
31358854,Soluble SLAMF7 promotes the growth of myeloma cells via homophilic interaction with surface SLAMF7.,"SLAMF7 is expressed mainly on multiple myeloma (MM) cells and considered an ideal target for immunotherapeutic approaches. Indeed, elotuzumab, an anti-SLAMF7 antibody, is used for the treatment of MM in combination with immunomodulatory drugs. SLAMF7 is cleaved via unknown mechanisms and detected as a soluble form (sSLAMF7) exclusively in the serum of MM patients; however, little is known about the role of sSLAMF7 in MM biology. In this study, we found that sSLAMF7 enhanced the growth of MM cells via homophilic interaction with surface SLAMF7 and subsequent activation of the SHP-2 and ERK signaling pathways. Elotuzumab suppressed sSLAMF7-induced MM cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Promoter analyses identified IKZF1 (Ikaros) as a pivotal transcriptional activator of the SLAMF7 gene. Pharmacological targeting of Ikaros by lenalidomide and its analog pomalidomide downregulated SLAMF7 expression and ameliorated the response of MM cells to sSLAMF7. Elotuzumab blocked the growth-promoting function of sSLAMF7 when combined with lenalidomide in a murine xenograft model. Neutralization of sSLAMF7 is a novel antimyeloma mechanism of elotuzumab, which is enhanced by immunomodulatory drugs via downregulation of surface SLAMF7 expression on MM cells. These findings may provide important information for the optimal use of elotuzumab in MM treatment.",,
7878046,Soluble type II interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor binds and blocks processing of IL-1 beta precursor and loses affinity for IL-1 receptor antagonist.,"Two IL-1 receptors have been identified, termed type I and type II. The extracellular domain of the type II IL-1 receptor is released from certain cells and can function as a specific inhibitor of IL-1 beta activity. We assessed the ligand-binding properties of the type II membrane-bound and soluble IL-1 receptor (sIL-1R) from the human B cell line Raji by competition. Upon release, the affinity of sIL-1R for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta remained constant, and both soluble and cell surface IL-1 receptors bound to the same regions on the IL-1 beta molecule as defined by binding of a series of IL-1 beta mutant molecules. However, the affinity of sIL-1R for the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) decreased by a factor of 2000 when compared with the cell surface receptor. Type II sIL-1R and IL-1ra had an additive effect in inhibiting the binding of IL-1 beta to cell surface IL-1 receptors. In contrast, the combination of recombinant type 1 sIL-1R with IL-1ra abrogated the inhibition seen with each of the individual agents alone. The type II cell surface IL-1 receptor failed to bind the biologically inactive IL-1 beta precursor molecule, but binding to the IL-1 beta precursor was observed on cellular release of the receptor; this was confirmed with 35S-labeled IL-1 beta. Binding of IL-1 beta precursor by sIL-1R inhibited the precursor's ability to be processed to the mature, biologically active 17-kDa species. These observations suggest that the type II sIL-1R inhibits IL-1 beta at two steps, by preventing processing of propeptide and by blocking the interaction of mature IL-1 beta with type I IL-1 receptor. In addition, type II sIL-1R does not interfere with inhibition mediated by IL-1ra.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1995
9931005,Solution structure and dynamics of the CX3C chemokine domain of fractalkine and its interaction with an N-terminal fragment of CX3CR1.,"Fractalkine, a novel CX3C chemokine, is unusual because of both its membrane-associated structure and its direct role in cell adhesion. We have solved the solution structure of the chemokine domain of fractalkine (residues 1-76) by heteronuclear NMR methods. The 20 lowest energy structures in the ensemble have an average backbone rmsd of 0.43 A, excluding the termini. In contrast to many other chemokines which form homodimers, fractalkine's chemokine module is monomeric. Comparison of the structure to CC and CXC chemokines reveals interesting differences which are likely to be relevant to receptor binding. These include a bulge formed by the CX3C motif, the relative orientation of the N-terminus and 30's loop (residues 30-38), and the conformation of the N-loop (residues 9-19). 15N backbone relaxation experiments indicate that these same regions of the protein are dynamic. We also titrated 15N-labeled protein with a peptide from the N-terminus of the receptor CX3CR1 and confirmed that this region of the receptor contacts the fractalkine chemokine domain. Interestingly, the binding site maps roughly to the regions of greatest flexibility and structural variability. Together, these data provide a first glimpse of how fractalkine interacts with its receptor and should help guide mutagenesis studies to further elucidate the molecular details of binding and signaling through CX3CR1.",,
9712872,"Solution structure of eotaxin, a chemokine that selectively recruits eosinophils in allergic inflammation.","The solution structure of the CCR3-specific chemokine, eotaxin, has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. The quaternary structure of eotaxin was investigated by ultracentrifugation and NMR, and it was found to be in equilibrium between monomer and dimer under a wide range of conditions. At pH </= 5 and low ionic strength, eotaxin was found to be predominantly a monomer. The three-dimensional structure of the eotaxin monomer solved at pH 5.0 revealed that it has a typical chemokine fold, which includes a 3-stranded beta-sheet and an overlying alpha-helix. Except for the N-terminal residues (residues 1-8), the core of the protein is well defined. The eotaxin structure is compared with the chemokines regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1); eotaxin binds only CC chemokine receptor CCR3, whereas RANTES binds many receptors including CCR3, and MCP-1 binds a distinct receptor, CCR2. The RMSD of the eotaxin ensemble of structures with the RANTES average minimized monomeric subunit is 5.52 +/- 0.87 A over all backbone atoms and 1.14 +/- 0.09 A over backbone atoms of residues 11-28 and 34-65. The most important difference between the structures is in the N-terminal residues that are unstructured in eotaxin but structured in RANTES and MCP-1. Several residues in the loop region of RANTES show similar packing in eotaxin (residues 11-17). As the N-terminal and loop regions have been shown to be critical for receptor binding and signaling, this structure will be useful for determining the basis for CCR3 selectivity of the eotaxin.",,
10544247,Solution structure of neuromedin B by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"The solution structure of neuromedin B (NMB) was investigated using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in membrane-mimicking environments. NMB adopts a relaxed helical conformation from Trp(4) to Met(10) in 50% aqueous 2,2, 2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) solution and in 150 mM SDS micelles. Sidechain atoms of the three residues, Trp(4), His(8) and Phe(9) orient toward the same direction and these residues might play a key role on interacting with hydrophobic acyl chains of the phospholipids in the membrane. NOESY experiments performed on NMB in non-deuterated SDS micelle show that aromatic ring protons of Trp(4) and Phe(9) residues are in close contact with methylene protons of SDS micelles. In addition, proton longitudinal relaxation data proved that the interactions between NMB with SDS micelle are characterized as extrinsic interaction. Trp(4) and Phe(9) seem to be important in interaction with receptor and this agrees with the previous studies of structure-activity relationship (Howell, D.C. et al. (1996) Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 48, 522-531). These conformational features might be helpful in understanding the molecular mechanism of the function of NMB and developing the efficient drugs.",FEBS letters,1999
8062828,"Solution structure of the epidermal growth factor-like domain of heregulin-alpha, a ligand for p180erbB-4.","p185erbB-2 and p180erbB-4 are epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-like tyrosine kinases, whose co-expression is observed in many breast carcinomas. Heregulins (HRGs), which contain an immunoglobulin unit and an EGF-like domain, bind to p180erbB-4 and activate p180erbB-4 and p185erbB-2 through transphosphorylation or receptor heterodimerization. The EGF-like domain is sufficient for the activation. Despite the sequence similarity, no cross activity is seen between the p180erbB-4 ligands (HRGs) and the p170erbB-1 ligands [EGF and transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha]. To investigate the structural basis of receptor specificity, we have determined the solution structure of the EGF-like domain of HRG-alpha by two-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations. Though its main-chain fold is similar to those of EGF and TGF-alpha, distinctive structural features are observed on the molecular surface including an ionic cluster and hydrophobic patches, which afford HRG-alpha the specific affinity for p180erbB-4. The structure should provide a basis for the structure-activity relationship of HRGs and for the design of drugs which prevent progression of breast cancer.",,
10551867,Somatostatin receptor interacting protein defines a novel family of multidomain proteins present in human and rodent brain.,"By using the yeast two-hybrid system we identified a novel protein from the human brain interacting with the C terminus of somatostatin receptor subtype 2. This protein termed somatostatin receptor interacting protein is characterized by a novel domain structure, consisting of six N-terminal ankyrin repeats followed by SH3 and PDZ domains, several proline-rich regions, and a C-terminal sterile alpha motif. It consists of 2185 amino acid residues encoded by a 9-kilobase pair mRNA; several splice variants have been detected in human and rat cDNA libraries. Sequence comparison suggests that the novel multidomain protein, together with cortactin-binding protein, forms a family of cytoskeletal anchoring proteins. Fractionation of rat brain membranes indicated that somatostatin receptor interacting protein is enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction. The interaction of somatostatin receptor subtype 2 with its interacting protein was verified by overlay assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments from transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Somatostatin receptor subtype 2 and the interacting protein display a striking overlap of their expression patterns in the rat brain. Interestingly, in the hippocampus the mRNA for somatostatin receptor interacting protein was not confined to the cell bodies but was also observed in the molecular layer, suggesting a dendritic localization of this mRNA.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
1337145,"Somatostatin receptors, an expanding gene family: cloning and functional characterization of human SSTR3, a protein coupled to adenylyl cyclase.","We previously reported the cloning of two distinct somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtypes, SSTR1 and SSTR2. Although both SSTR1 and SSTR2 bound somatostatin specifically and with high affinity, neither was coupled to adenylyl cyclase, a major cellular effector of somatostatin's actions. Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of a third member of the SSTR family. Human SSTR3 is a protein of 418 amino acids and has 45% and 46% identity with human SSTR1 and SSTR2, respectively. RNA blotting studies showed that SSTR3 mRNA could be readily detected in brain and pancreatic islets. The pharmacological properties of human SSTR3 were characterized by transiently expressing the human SSTR3 gene in COS-1 cells. Membranes from cells expressing human SSTR3 bound the somatostatin agonist [125I]CGP 23996 specifically and with high affinity, with a rank order of potency of somatostatin-28 = CGP 23996 > somatostatin-14 > SMS-201-995. Studies using cells transiently coexpressing the human dopamine D1 receptor and human SSTR3 showed that somatostatin was able to inhibit dopamine-stimulated cAMP formation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that SSTR3 was functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase. These results indicate that the diverse biological effects of somatostatin are mediated by a family of receptor with distinct, but overlapping, tissue distributions, unique pharmacological properties, and potentially different functions.",,
15710408,SorCS3 does not require propeptide cleavage to bind nerve growth factor.,"The functional properties of the Vps10p-domain receptor SorCS3 are undescribed. Here, we examine its processing and sorting in cellular transfectants, and analyze the binding of potential ligands to the purified receptor. We show that SorCS3 is synthesized as a proprotein and converted to its mature form by N-terminal propeptide cleavage in distal Golgi compartments. The propeptide is not a requirement for normal processing of the receptor and does not prevent ligands from binding to the SorCS3 precursor form. Expression of wt and chimeric receptors further suggests that SorCS3 predominates on the plasma membrane, exhibits slow internalization and does not engage in intracellular trafficking. SorCS3 emerges as a new neurotrophin binding Vps10p-domain receptor functionally distinct from its relatives Sortilin and SorLA.",,
15987945,Sortilin controls intracellular sorting of brain-derived neurotrophic factor to the regulated secretory pathway.,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), after activity-dependent secretion from neurons, modulates critical nervous system functions. Recently, a variant in the human bdnf gene, resulting in a valine to methionine substitution in the prodomain, has been shown to lead to defective regulated secretion from neurons and memory impairment. Here, we report a novel function for a Vps10p domain protein, sortilin, in controlling BDNF sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. Sortilin interacts specifically with BDNF in a region encompassing the methionine substitution and colocalizes with BDNF in secretory granules in neurons. A truncated form of sortilin causes BDNF missorting to the constitutive secretory pathway without affecting neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) secretion. In addition, sortilin small interfering RNA introduced into primary neurons also led to BDNF missorting from the regulated to the constitutive secretory pathway. Together, these data suggest a mechanism to understand the defect associated with variant BDNF and provide a framework, based on divergent presynaptic regulation of sorting to secretory pathways, to explain how two ligands for tropomyosin-related kinase B, BDNF and NT-4, can mediate diverse biological responses.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2005
14985763,Sortilin is essential for proNGF-induced neuronal cell death.,"Sortilin (approximately 95 kDa) is a member of the recently discovered family of Vps10p-domain receptors, and is expressed in a variety of tissues, notably brain, spinal cord and muscle. It acts as a receptor for neurotensin, but predominates in regions of the nervous system that neither synthesize nor respond to this neuropeptide, suggesting that sortilin has additional roles. Sortilin is expressed during embryogenesis in areas where nerve growth factor (NGF) and its precursor, proNGF, have well-characterized effects. These neurotrophins can be released by neuronal tissues, and they regulate neuronal development through cell survival and cell death signalling. NGF regulates cell survival and cell death via binding to two different receptors, TrkA and p75NTR (ref. 10). In contrast, proNGF selectively induces apoptosis through p75NTR but not TrkA. However, not all p75NTR-expressing cells respond to proNGF, suggesting that additional membrane proteins are required for the induction of cell death. Here we report that proNGF creates a signalling complex by simultaneously binding to p75NTR and sortilin. Thus sortilin acts as a co-receptor and molecular switch governing the p75NTR-mediated pro-apoptotic signal induced by proNGF.",Nature,2004
9748228,"Specific activation of Smad1 signaling pathways by the BMP7 type I receptor, ALK2.","BMP7 and activin are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Here we characterize endogenous activin and BMP7 signaling pathways in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells. We show that BMP7 and activin bind to the same type II receptors, ActRII and IIB, but recruit distinct type I receptors into heteromeric receptor complexes. The major BMP7 type I receptor observed was ALK2, while activin bound exclusively to ALK4 (ActRIB). BMP7 and activin elicited distinct biological responses and activated different Smad pathways. BMP7 stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous Smad1 and 5, formation of complexes with Smad4 and induced the promoter for the homeobox gene, Tlx2. In contrast, activin induced phosphorylation of Smad2, association with Smad4, and induction of the activin response element from the Xenopus Mix.2 gene. Biochemical analysis revealed that constitutively active ALK2 associated with and phosphorylated Smad1 on the COOH-terminal SSXS motif, and also regulated Smad5 and Smad8 phosphorylation. Activated ALK2 also induced the Tlx2 promoter in the absence of BMP7. Furthermore, we show that ALK1 (TSRI), an orphan receptor that is closely related to ALK2 also mediates Smad1 signaling. Thus, ALK1 and ALK2 induce Smad1-dependent pathways and ALK2 functions to mediate BMP7 but not activin signaling.",,
15581623,Specific association of annexin 1 with plasma membrane-resident and internalized EGF receptors mediated through the protein core domain.,"Phosphorylation of the Ca2+ and membrane-binding protein annexin 1 by epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase has been thought to be involved in regulation of the EGF receptor trafficking. To elucidate the interaction of annexin 1 during EGF receptor internalization, we followed the distribution of annexin 1-GFP fusion proteins at sites of internalizing EGF receptors. The observed association of annexin 1 with EGF receptors was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. We found that this interaction was independent of a functional phosphorylation site in the annexin 1 N-terminal domain but mediated through the Ca2+ binding core domain.",FEBS letters,2004
9058715,"Specific inhibition of thrombin-induced cell activation by the neutrophil proteinases elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3: evidence for distinct cleavage sites within the aminoterminal domain of the thrombin receptor.","The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of human leukocyte elastase (HLE), cathepsin G (Cat G), and proteinase 3 (PR3) on the activation of endothelial cells (ECs) and platelets by thrombin and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Although preincubation of ECs with HLE or Cat G prevented cytosolic calcium mobilization and prostacyclin synthesis induced by thrombin, these cell responses were not affected when triggered by TRAP42-55, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of the tethered ligand (Ser42-Phe55) unmasked by thrombin on cleavage of its receptor. Using IIaR-A, a monoclonal antibody directed against the sequence encompassing this cleavage site, flow cytometry analysis showed that the surface expression of this epitope was abolished after incubation of ECs with HLE or Cat G. Further experiments conducted with platelets indicated that not only HLE and Cat G but also PR3 inhibited cell activation induced by thrombin, although they were again ineffective when TRAP42-55 was the agonist. Similar to that for ECs, the epitope for IIaR-A disappeared on treatment of platelets with either proteinase. These results suggested that the neutrophil enzymes proteolyzed the thrombin receptor downstream of the thrombin cleavage site (Arg41-Ser42) but left intact the TRAP42-55 binding site (Gln83-Ser93) within the extracellular aminoterminal domain. The capacity of these proteinases to cleave five overlapping synthetic peptides mapping the portion of the receptor from Asn35 to Pro85 was then investigated. Mass spectrometry studies showed several distinct cleavage sites, i.e., two for HLE (Val(72)-Ser73 and Ile74-Asn75), three for Cat G (Arg41-Ser42, Phe55-Trp56 and Tyr69-Arg70), and one for PR3 (Val(72)-Ser73). We conclude that this singular susceptibility of the thrombin receptor to proteolysis accounts for the ability of neutrophil proteinases to inhibit cell responses to thrombin.",Blood,1997
9516430,"Specific interaction of the recombinant disintegrin-like domain of MDC-15 (metargidin, ADAM-15) with integrin alphavbeta3.","MDC-15 (ADAM-15, metargidin), a membrane-anchored metalloprotease/disintegrin/cysteine-rich protein, is expressed on the surface of a wide range of cells and has an RGD tripeptide in its disintegrin-like domain. MDC-15 is potentially involved in cell-cell interactions through its interaction with integrins. We expressed a recombinant MDC-15 disintegrin-like domain as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (designated D-15) in bacteria and examined its binding function to integrins using mammalian cells expressing different recombinant integrins. We found that D-15 specifically interacts with alphavbeta3 but not with the other integrins tested (alpha2beta1, alpha3beta1, alpha4beta1, alpha5beta1, alpha6beta1, alpha6beta4, alphavbeta1, alphaIIbbeta3, and alphaLbeta2). Mutation of the tripeptide RGD to SGA totally blocked binding of D-15 to alphavbeta3, suggesting that D-15-alphavbeta3 interaction is RGD-dependent. When the sequence RPTRGD is mutated to NWKRGD, D-15 is recognized by both alphaIIbbeta3 and alphavbeta3, suggesting that the receptor binding specificity is mediated by the sequence flanking the RGD tripeptide, as in snake venom disintegrins. These results indicate that the disintegrin-like domain of MDC-15 functions as an adhesion molecule and may be involved n alphavbeta3-mediated cell-cell interactions.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
11286993,"Specific involvement of G(alphai2) with epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in rat hepatocytes, and the inhibitory effect of chronic ethanol.","We have previously shown that chronic alcohol consumption inhibits liver regeneration by impairing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-operated phospholipase C-(gamma1) (PLC-(gamma1)) activation and the resultant rise in intracellular [Ca(2+)](i). In hepatocytes, activation of PLC-(gamma1) by EGFR requires involvement of a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G(alphai)) as an intermediate. In the present study, we first identified the G(alphai) protein isoform associated with the activated EGFR, and then examined whether the toxic effect of alcohol on EGFR signaling and liver cell proliferation was exerted on this association. In cultured hepatocytes from control rats, EGF rapidly induced association between EGFR and G(alphai2) but not other G(alphai) isoforms. In hepatocytes from rats fed alcohol for 16 weeks, EGF failed to stimulate this association of G(alphai2) with the EGFR. The impairment of EGFR-G(alphai2) complex formation caused by alcohol was associated with a decreased level of G(alphai2) in the plasma membrane fraction (approximately 50% control). Pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of G(alphai) function, produced an analogous disruption of the association between G(alphai2) and the EGFR, as well as inhibiting EGF-induced DNA synthesis. It is concluded that, in hepatocytes, G(alphai2) is specific among G(alphai) isoforms in coupling activation of the EGFR to other signaling pathways that control cell proliferation. Impaired coupling of G(alphai2) of EGFR could contribute to the mechanism by which chronic alcohol exposure inhibits liver regeneration.",Biochemical pharmacology,2001
9886400,"Specific recognition of HLA-E, but not classical, HLA class I molecules by soluble CD94/NKG2A and NK cells.","The CD94/NKG2 receptors expressed by subpopulations of NK cells and T cells have been implicated as receptors for a broad range of both classical and nonclassical HLA class I molecules. To examine the ligand specificity of CD94/NKG2 proteins, a soluble heterodimeric form of the receptor was produced and used in direct binding studies with cells expressing defined HLA class I/peptide complexes. We confirm that CD94/NKG2A specifically interacts with HLA-E and demonstrate that this interaction is dependent on the association of HLA-E with peptide. Moreover, no interaction between CD94/NKG2A and classical HLA class I molecules was observed, as assayed by direct binding of the soluble receptor or by functional assays using CD94/NKG2A+ NK cells. The role of the peptide associated with HLA-E in the interaction between HLA-E and CD94/NKG2A was also assessed. All class I leader sequence peptides tested bound to HLA-E and were recognized by CD94/NKG2A. However, amino acid variations in class I leader sequences affected the stability of HLA-E. Additionally, not all HLA-E/peptide complexes examined were recognized by CD94/NKG2A. Thus CD94/NKG2A recognition of HLA-E is controlled by peptide at two levels; first, peptide must stabilize HLA-E and promote cell surface expression, and second, the HLA-E/peptide complex must form the ligand for CD94/NKG2A.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1999
14530373,"Specific recruitment of antigen-presenting cells by chemerin, a novel processed ligand from human inflammatory fluids.","Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that play key roles in both innate and adaptive immunity. ChemR23 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor related to chemokine receptors, which is expressed specifically in these cell types. Here we present the characterization of chemerin, a novel chemoattractant protein, which acts through ChemR23 and is abundant in a diverse set of human inflammatory fluids. Chemerin is secreted as a precursor of low biological activity, which upon proteolytic cleavage of its COOH-terminal domain, is converted into a potent and highly specific agonist of ChemR23, the chemerin receptor. Activation of chemerin receptor results in intracellular calcium release, inhibition of cAMP accumulation, and phosphorylation of p42-p44 MAP kinases, through the Gi class of heterotrimeric G proteins. Chemerin is structurally and evolutionary related to the cathelicidin precursors (antibacterial peptides), cystatins (cysteine protease inhibitors), and kininogens. Chemerin was shown to promote calcium mobilization and chemotaxis of immature DCs and macrophages in a ChemR23-dependent manner. Therefore, chemerin appears as a potent chemoattractant protein of a novel class, which requires proteolytic activation and is specific for APCs.",The Journal of experimental medicine,2003
10066262,Specification of distinct dopaminergic neural pathways: roles of the Eph family receptor EphB1 and ligand ephrin-B2.,"Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area project to the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens/olfactory tubercle, respectively, constituting mesostriatal and mesolimbic pathways. The molecular signals that confer target specificity of different dopaminergic neurons are not known. We now report that EphB1 and ephrin-B2, a receptor and ligand of the Eph family, are candidate guidance molecules for the development of these distinct pathways. EphB1 and ephrin-B2 are expressed in complementary patterns in the midbrain dopaminergic neurons and their targets, and the ligand specifically inhibits the growth of neurites and induces the cell loss of substantia nigra, but not ventral tegmental, dopaminergic neurons. These studies suggest that the ligand-receptor pair may contribute to the establishment of distinct neural pathways by selectively inhibiting the neurite outgrowth and cell survival of mistargeted neurons. In addition, we show that ephrin-B2 expression is upregulated by cocaine and amphetamine in adult mice, suggesting that ephrin-B2/EphB1 interaction may play a role in drug-induced plasticity in adults as well.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,1999
10336501,Specificity for fibroblast growth factors determined by heparan sulfate in a binary complex with the receptor kinase.,"A divalent cation-dependent association between heparin or heparan sulfate and the ectodomain of the FGF receptor kinase (FGFR) restricts FGF-independent trans-phosphorylation and supports the binding of activating FGF to self-associated FGFR. Here we show that in contrast to heparin, cellular heparan sulfate forms a binary complex with FGFR that discriminates between FGF-1 and FGF-2. FGFR type 4 (FGFR4) in liver parenchymal cells binds only FGF-1, whereas FGFR1 binds FGF-1 and FGF-2 equally. Cell-free complexes of heparin and recombinant FGFR4 bound FGF-1 and FGF-2 equally. However, in contrast to FGFR1, when recombinant FGFR4 was expressed back in epithelial cells by transfection, it failed to bind FGF-2 unless heparan sulfate was depressed by chlorate or heparinase treatment. Isolated heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) from liver cells in cell-free complexes with FGFR4 restored the specificity for FGF-1 and supported the binding of both FGF-1 and FGF-2 when complexed with FGFR1. In contrast, FGF-2 bound equally well to complexes of both FGFR1 and FGFR4 formed with endothelial cell-derived HSPG, but the endothelial HSPG was deficient for the binding of FGF-1 to both FGFR complexes. These data suggest that a heparan sulfate subunit is a cell type- and FGFR-specific determinant of the selectivity of the FGFR signaling complex for FGF. In a physiological context, the heparan sulfate subunit may limit the redundancy among the current 18 FGF polypeptides for the 4 known FGFR.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
22577141,Sperm epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediates α7 acetylcholine receptor (AChR) activation to promote fertilization.,"To attain fertilization the spermatozoon binds to the egg zona pellucida (ZP) via sperm receptor(s) and undergoes an acrosome reaction (AR). Several sperm receptors have been described in the literature; however, the identity of this receptor is not yet certain. In this study, we suggest that the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) might be a sperm receptor activated by ZP to induce epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated AR. We found that isolated ZP or α7 agonists induced the AR in sperm from WT but not α7-null spermatozoa, and the induced AR was inhibited by α7 or EGFR antagonists. Moreover, α7-null sperm showed very little binding to the egg, and microfluidic affinity in vitro assay clearly showed that α7nAChR, as well as EGFR, interacted with ZP3. Induction of EGFR activation and the AR by an α7 agonist was inhibited by a Src family kinase (SFK) inhibitor. In conclusion we suggest that activation of α7 by ZP leads to SFK-dependent EGFR activation, Ca(2+) influx, and the acrosome reaction.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2012
30305242,Spexin: A novel regulator of adipogenesis and fat tissue metabolism.,"Spexin (SPX, NPQ) is a novel peptide involved in the regulation of energy metabolism. SPX inhibits food intake and reduces body weight. In obese humans, SPX is the most down-regulated gene in fat. Therefore, SPX might be involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Here, we study the effects of SPX on lipolysis, lipogenesis, glucose uptake, adipogenesis, cell proliferation and survival in isolated human adipocytes or murine 3T3-L1 cells. SPX and its receptors, GALR2 and GALR3, are present at mRNA and protein levels in murine 3T3-L1 cells and human adipocytes. SPX inhibits adipogenesis and down-regulates mRNA expression of proadipogenic genes such as Pparγ, C/ebpα, C/ebpβ and Fabp4. SPX stimulates lipolysis by increasing the phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). Simultaneously, SPX inhibits lipogenesis and glucose uptake in human adipocytes and murine 3T3-L1 cells. SPX has no effect on murine 3T3-L1 cell proliferation and viability. Moreover, our research showed that the SPX effect on adipocytes metabolism is mediated via GALR2 and GALR3 receptors. SPX is a novel regulator of lipid metabolism in murine 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes.",,
26321637,Splicing-Dependent Trans-synaptic SALM3-LAR-RPTP Interactions Regulate Excitatory Synapse Development and Locomotion.,"Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate diverse aspects of synapse development and plasticity. SALM3 is a PSD-95-interacting synaptic adhesion molecule known to induce presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons, but little is known about its presynaptic receptors and in vivo functions. Here, we identify an interaction between SALM3 and LAR family receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) that requires the mini-exon B splice insert in LAR-RPTPs. In addition, SALM3-dependent presynaptic differentiation requires all three types of LAR-RPTPs. SALM3 mutant (Salm3(-/-)) mice display markedly reduced excitatory synapse number but normal synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region. Salm3(-/-) mice exhibit hypoactivity in both novel and familiar environments but perform normally in learning and memory tests administered. These results suggest that SALM3 regulates excitatory synapse development and locomotion behavior.",Cell reports,2015
29440144,SPON2 Promotes M1-like Macrophage Recruitment and Inhibits Hepatocellular Carcinoma Metastasis by Distinct Integrin-Rho GTPase-Hippo Pathways.,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) represent key regulators of the complex interplay between cancer and the immune microenvironment. Matricellular protein SPON2 is essential for recruiting lymphocytes and initiating immune responses. Recent studies have shown that SPON2 has complicated roles in cell migration and tumor progression. Here we report that, in the tumor microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SPON2 not only promotes infiltration of M1-like macrophages but also inhibits tumor metastasis. SPON2-α4β1 integrin signaling activated RhoA and Rac1, increased F-actin reorganization, and promoted M1-like macrophage recruitment. F-Actin accumulation also activated the Hippo pathway by suppressing LATS1 phosphorylation, promoting YAP nuclear translocation, and initiating downstream gene expression. However, SPON2-α5β1 integrin signaling inactivated RhoA and prevented F-actin assembly, thereby inhibiting HCC cell migration; the Hippo pathway was not noticeably involved in SPON2-mediated HCC cell migration. In HCC patients, SPON2 levels correlated positively with prognosis. Overall, our findings provide evidence that SPON2 is a critical factor in mediating the immune response against tumor cell growth and migration in HCC.",Cancer research,2018

It is not clear how KIR, whose function lies downstream of a tyrosine kinase, succeeds in blocking proximal NK cell activation signals upon binding HLA class I on target cells. Here we show that mixing NK cells with insect cells expressing HLA-C was sufficient to induce clustering of KIR, and phosphorylation of KIR and SHP-1. Transient phosphorylation of KIR was detected in the presence of pervanadate, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, at suboptimal concentration. Phosphorylation of KIR was specifically induced by ligand binding because it was detected only when HLA-C was loaded with a peptide that permits KIR binding. KIR phosphorylation was not dependent on ICAM-1-mediated adhesion and was not blocked by inhibition of actin polymerization, but required Zn(2+). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between HLA-C molecules revealed close molecular interactions induced by KIR binding. These results demonstrate tight clustering of KIR and rapid KIR phosphorylation induced simply by binding to HLA-C. The unique property of KIR to become phosphorylated in the absence of adhesion and of actin cytoskeleton rearrangement explains how KIR can efficiently block early activation signals during NK-target cell contacts.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2003
15371419,"SREC-I, a type F scavenger receptor, is an endocytic receptor for calreticulin.","Calreticulin and gp96 (GRP94) traffic associated peptides into the major histocompatibility complex class-I cross-presentation pathway of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Efficient accession of the cross-presentation pathway requires APC receptor-mediated endocytosis of the chaperone/peptide complexes. Previously, scavenger receptor class-A (SRA) was shown to play a substantial role in trafficking gp96 and calreticulin into macrophages, accounting for half of total receptor-mediated uptake. However, the scavenger receptor ligand fucoidin competed the chaperone uptake beyond that accounted for by SRA, indicating that another scavenger receptor(s) may also contribute. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that the residual calreticulin uptake into SRA(-/-) macrophages is competed by the scavenger receptor ligand acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL). We now report that an additional scavenger receptor, SREC-I (scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cell-I), mediates the endocytosis of calreticulin and gp96. Ectopic expression of SREC-I in Chinese hamster ovary cells yielded chaperone recognition and uptake, and these processes were competed by the inhibitory ligands fucoidin and acetylated (Ac)LDL. Although AcLDL competes for the chaperone interactions with SRA and SREC, we showed that not all of the scavenger receptors, which bind AcLDL, bind calreticulin or gp96. The overexpression of SREC-I in macrophages increased chaperone endocytosis, indicating that SREC-I functions in APCs and that the cytosolic components necessary for the endocytosis of SREC-I and its cargo are present and not limiting in APCs. These data identify a novel class of ligands for SREC-I and provide insight into the mechanisms by which APCs and potentially endothelial cells traffic chaperone/antigen complexes.",,
7962171,Stabilization of C5a receptor--G-protein interactions through ligand binding.,"Binding of biotin-C5a to the C5a receptor in membrane fragments followed by detergent solubilization and purification with streptavidin-agarose affinity chromatography resulted in the isolation of a receptor complex with associated G-proteins. In contrast, when receptor was detergent-solubilized in the absence of C5a and purified by affinity chromatography with Affigel-C5a, G-proteins did not copurify. Since the results indicate that receptor ligation stabilized the receptor--G-protein interaction to allow purification of the complex, the findings emphasize the dynamic nature of the C5a receptor-effector interactions. When biotin-C5a-ligated receptor was purified from a mouse cell line overexpressing recombinant human receptor, both Gialpha2 and Gialpha3 subunits copurified, confirming that multiple transducing systems are linked to the C5a receptor. The method of stabilization of receptor-transducer complexes offers the opportunity to further elaborate the interactions of the C5a receptor with diverse transducing elements and second messenger systems.",Journal of cellular biochemistry,1994

The binding of radiolabled substance P and neurokinin A (substance K) to CHO clones expressing the NK1 and NK2 receptors, respectively, were saturatable and of high affinity (Kd = 0.17 nM (NK1); 3.4 nM (NK2)). Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated for both receptors binding to a single population of binding sites, and competition binding studies showed that the binding specificities of the receptors corresponded to those of classical NK1 and NK2 receptors. In contrast, the binding of eledoisin to the NK3 receptor expressed in the transfected CHO cells was of low affinity (IC50 = 240 nM) compared to the high affinity of the receptor found when it was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (IC50 = 8 nM). However, in both cases the receptor exhibited the specificity of a classical NK3 receptor.

We compared the binding properties of [3H]-desArg10-[Leu9]-kallidin, a radiolabelled kinin B1 receptor antagonist, to membranes from IMR-90 human embryonic fibroblasts and from 293 cells transiently or stably transfected with the human B1 receptor. 2. The dissociation constant (KD) of [3H]-desArg10-[Leu9]-kallidin and the affinity of several kinin receptor agonists and antagonists were similar between the native and cloned receptor, either transiently or stably expressed in 293 cells. In IMR-90 cells, the rank order of potency was that expected for a kinin B1 receptor. 3. The receptors transiently or stably expressed in 293 cells were fully functional with respect to their signalling properties. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis was increased in a concentration-dependent manner by the B1 receptor agonist, desArg10-kallidin. Functional coupling to the calcium pathway was also demonstrated for the native and stably expressed human B1 receptor. 4.

9111052,Stable expression of the human kinin B1 receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Characterization of ligand binding and effector pathways.,"To delineate ligand binding and functional characteristics of the human B1 kinin receptor, a stable clone of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a single class of binding sites for [3H]des-Arg10-lysylbradykinin with a Kd of 0.3 nM and a Bmax of 38 fmol/mg protein ( approximately 40,000 receptors/cell) was isolated. Studies with peptide analogs showed that a lysine residue at position 1 (based on the lysylbradykinin sequence) of ligands was essential for high affinity binding to the human B1 receptor. In marked contrast to cloned Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human kinin B2 receptor, which internalized approximately 80% of the ligand within 5 min upon exposure to 2 nM [3H]bradykinin, exposure of cells expressing the B1 receptor to 1 nM [3H]des-Arg10-lysylbradykinin resulted in minimal ligand internalization. Stimulation of the B1 receptor led to inositol phosphate generation and transient increases in intracellular calcium, confirming coupling to phospholipase C, while immunoprecipitation of photoaffinity-labeled G-proteins from membranes indicated specific coupling of the receptor to Galphaq/11 and Galphai1,2. The B1, unlike the B2, receptor does not desensitize (as demonstrated by continuous phosphoinositide hydrolysis), enhancing the potential role of this receptor during inflammatory events.",,

In the present study we stably expressed the rat B-cell GLP-I receptor in CHO cells and studied binding characteristics and receptor activation utilizing the naturally occurring receptor agonist GLP-I(7-36)-amide (GLP-I), the proglucagon-derived GLP-I-related peptide oxyntomodulin, the GLP-I receptor agonist exendin-4, and the specific antagonist exendin(9-39). The potencies to displace [125I]GLP-I from the receptor were GLP-I > exendin-4 > exendin(9-39) > oxyntomodulin, and to displace [125I]exendin-4 GLP-I = exendin-4 > exendin(9-39) > oxyntomodulin. cAMP production was stimulated equally by GLP-I and exendin-4. Oxyntomodulin was less potent to stimulate cAMP generation. Exendin(9-39) blocked the stimulatory action of GLP-I and exendin-4 on cAMP production, but not that of oxyntomodulin. This study shows that GLP-I and exendin-4 are potent agonists at the transfected rat B-cell GLP-I receptor whereas oxyntomodulin is only a weak GLP-I receptor agonist.

The following data were obtained: (1) one class of binding site was identified by Scatchard analysis of [125I]VIP binding to cell membranes with a Kd of 0.41 nM and a Bmax of 1.62 pmol/mg protein; (2) the constant Ki for the inhibition of [125I]VIP binding by VIP and related peptides was: VIP (0.9 nM) = pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)-27 (1.3 nM) < PACAP-38 (6.8 nM) < helodermin (46.0 nM) < human growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) (0.6 microM) < peptide histidine methionineamide (2.0 microM) < secretin (> 10 microM); (3) cross-linking experiments using [125I]VIP identified a single M(r) 67000 recombinant receptor; (4) VIP stimulated cAMP production in Clone 15 cells with an EC50 of 0.20 nM; (5) some previously described VIP receptor antagonists including [4-Cl-D-Phe6, Leu17]VIP, [Ac-Tyr1,D-Phe2]GRF-(1-29) amide and VIP-(10-28) inhibited [125I]VIP binding with a Ki of 0.7, 1.6 and 2.5 microM, respectively. They failed to stimulate cAMP production in Clone 15 cells and inhibited, at least partially, the VIP (0.3 nM)-evoked cAMP production; (6) exposure of Clone 15 cells to 10 nM VIP for 24 h resulted in a sharp decrease in Bmax in Clone 15 cells (0.43 vs. 1.62 pmol/mg protein in control cells) and in the potency and efficacy of VIP in stimulating cAMP. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies using confocal microscopy indicated that the receptor was internalized and sequestered in vesicular structures within the cells. It is concluded that Clone 15 cells provide a valuable tool to further characterize various functional and pharmacological aspects of the human VIP1 receptor.",European journal of pharmacology,1996

1698556,Stem cell factor is encoded at the Sl locus of the mouse and is the ligand for the c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor.,"We have cloned a partial cDNA encoding murine stem cell factor (SCF) and show that the gene is syntenic with the Sl locus on mouse chromosome 10. Using retroviral vectors to immortalize fetal liver stromal cell lines from mice harboring lethal mutations at the Sl locus (Sl/Sl), we have shown that SCF genomic sequences are deleted in these lines. Furthermore, two other mutations at Sl, Sld and Sl12H, are associated with deletions or alterations of SCF genomic sequences. In vivo administration of SCF can reverse the macrocytic anemia and locally repair the mast cell deficiency of Sl/Sld mice. We have also provided biological and physical evidence that SCF is a ligand for the c-kit receptor.",Cell,1990
11369591,"Stimulation by n6-cyclopentyladenosine of A1 adenosine receptors, coupled to galphai2 protein subunit, has a capacitative effect on human spermatozoa.","The effects of selective A(1) receptor agonist on human spermatozoa were examined to verify physiological responses and to investigate the signal transduction pathway. N6-Cyclopentyladenosine on uncapacitated spermatozoa did not induce spontaneous acrosome reaction after 5 h capacitation, whereas the number of capacitated spermatozoa, assessed by lysophosphatidylcholine-induced acrosome reaction with Pisum sativum agglutinin staining, was significantly increased. N6-Cyclopentyladenosine was also added to capacitated human spermatozoa to find out whether the agonist could induce the acrosome reaction. Results, although statistically significant, could not be considered biologically significant. A1-Mediated capacitation was followed by the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein subset ranging between M(r) = 200 000 and 30 000. Stimulation of A1 receptor with the selective agonist elicited an agonist-induced inositol phospholipid hydrolysis leading to a transient rise of inositol triphosphate (IP3). This increase was not induced by A(1) receptor antagonist and was blocked by phospholipase C inhibitor. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that the A(1) receptor is coupled to Galphai2 subunit suggesting that the activation of phospholipase C is mediated by betagamma subunits. In conclusion, the A(1) adenosine receptor in human spermatozoa is coupled to Galphai2, signals via IP3, and affects the capacitative status of ejaculated spermatozoa.",,
15936756,Stimulation of cell surface plasminogen activation by membrane-bound melanotransferrin: a key phenomenon for cell invasion.,"The activation of plasminogen at the cell surface is a crucial step in cell migration and invasion. In the present study, the effect of membrane-bound melanotransferrin (mMTf), also known as human melanoma antigen p97, on cell surface plasminogen binding and activation was investigated by using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells transfected with full-length melanotransferrin (MTf) cDNA and SK-MeL-28 melanoma cells. The expression of mMTf in CHO increased cell surface plasminogen binding by about 2-fold. In addition, application of the monoclonal antibody L235 against MTf as well as truncated, soluble MTf (sMTf) abolished plasminogen binding to MTf-transfected and SK-MeL-28 cells, indicating that mMTf is a potential cell surface plasminogen receptor. Moreover, mMTf expression in CHO cells stimulates plasminogen activation at the cell surface by about 2.5-fold. In addition to the induced binding and activation of plasminogen, cell motility, migration and invasion were about 3-fold higher in CHO cells expressing mMTf. Both monoclonal antibody L235 and truncated sMTf inhibited mMTf-stimulated CHO cell motility, migration and invasion. Overall, our results indicate a key role for mMTf in cell surface plasminogen binding and in activation processes involved during cell migration and invasion.",Experimental cell research,2005
9223454,STRL22 is a receptor for the CC chemokine MIP-3alpha.,"STRL22 is a human seven transmembrane domain orphan receptor related to known chemokine receptors and expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and lymphoid tissues. MIP-3alpha/LARC/Exodus is a CC chemokine that is chemotactic for lymphocytes and that is expressed in activated cells, including monocytes, T cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, and in liver, lung, and some lymphoid tissues. We report here that STRL22-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells demonstrated specific binding for MIP-3alpha and that MIP-3alpha, but no other chemokines, produced a calcium flux in the STRL22-transfected cells. We show that MIP-3alpha, unlike other chemokines, produced a calcium flux in freshly-isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes and we show that MIP-3alpha also produced a signal in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes that express STRL22. Since STRL22 is the sixth functional CC chemokine receptor identified, it should be re-named CCR6.",,
29301984,Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (CXCL12) activates integrins by direct binding to an allosteric ligand-binding site (site 2) of integrins without CXCR4.,"Leukocyte arrest on the endothelial cell surface during leukocyte extravasation is induced by rapid integrin activation by chemokines. We recently reported that fractalkine induces integrin activation without its receptor CX3CR1 through binding to the allosteric site (site 2) of integrins. Peptides from site 2 bound to fractalkine and suppressed integrin activation by fractalkine. We hypothesized that this is not limited to membrane-bound fractalkine. We studied whether stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1), another chemokine that plays a critical role in leukocyte arrest, activates integrins through binding to site 2. We describe here that (1) SDF1 activated soluble integrin αvβ3 in cell-free conditions, suggesting that SDF1 can activate αvβ3 without CXCR4; (2) site 2 peptide bound to SDF1, suggesting that SDF1 binds to site 2; (3) SDF1 activated integrins αvβ3, α4β1, and α5β1 on CHO cells (CXCR4-negative) and site 2 peptide suppressed the activation; (4) A CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 did not affect the site 2-mediated integrin activation by SDF1; (5) Cell-surface integrins were fully activated in 1 min (much faster than activation of soluble αvβ3) and the activation lasted at least for 1 h. We propose that the binding of SDF1 to cell-surface proteoglycan facilitates the allosteric activation process; (6) Mutations in the predicted site 2-binding site in SDF1 suppressed integrin activation. These results suggest that SDF1 (e.g. presented on proteoglycans) can rapidly activate integrins in an allosteric manner by binding to site 2 in the absence of CXCR4. The allosteric integrin activation by SDF1 is a novel target for drug discovery.",,
12714578,"Stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXCL12 directly enhances survival/antiapoptosis of myeloid progenitor cells through CXCR4 and G(alpha)i proteins and enhances engraftment of competitive, repopulating stem cells.","Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) enhances survival of myeloid progenitor cells. The two main questions addressed by us were whether these effects on the progenitors were direct-acting and if SDF-1/CXCL12 enhanced engrafting capability of competitive, repopulating mouse stem cells subjected to short-term ex vivo culture with other growth factors. SDF-1/CXCL12 had survival-enhancing/antiapoptosis effects on human bone marrow (BM) and cord blood (CB) and mouse BM colony-forming units (CFU)-granulocyte macrophage, burst-forming units-erythroid, and CFU-granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte with similar dose responses. The survival effects were direct-acting, as assessed on colony formation by single isolated human BM and CB CD34(+++) cells. Effects were mediated through CXCR4 and G(alpha)i proteins. Moreover, SDF-1/CXCL12 greatly enhanced the engrafting capability of mouse long-term, marrow-competitive, repopulating stem cells cultured ex vivo with interleukin-6 and steel factor for 48 h. These results extend information on the survival effects mediated through the SDF-1/CXCL12-CXCR4 axis and may be of relevance for ex vivo expansion and gene-transduction procedures.",Journal of leukocyte biology,2003
11359774,Structural analysis of the alpha(2) integrin I domain/procollagenase-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1) interaction.,"Previous studies have established that ligation of keratinocyte alpha(2)beta(1) integrin by type I collagen induces expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and that MMP-1 activity is required for the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin-dependent migration of primary keratinocytes across collagenous matrices. We now present evidence that MMP-1 binds the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin via the I domain of the alpha(2) integrin subunit. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with purified human MMP-1 and recombinant alpha(2) integrin I domain, we showed that the alpha(2) integrin I domain specifically bound in a divalent cation-dependent manner to both the pro and active forms of MMP-1, but not to MMP-3 or MMP-13. Although both the I domain and MMP-1 bind divalent cations, MMP-1 bound, in a divalent cation-dependent manner, to alpha(2) integrin I domains containing metal ion-dependent adhesion sites motif mutations that prevent divalent cation binding to the I domain, demonstrating that the metal ion dependence is a function of MMP-1. Using a series of MMP-1-MMP-3 and MMP-1-MMP-13 chimeras, we determined that both the linker domain and the hemopexin-like domain of MMP-1 were required for optimal binding to the I domain. The alpha(2) integrin/MMP-1 interaction described here extends an emerging paradigm in matrix biology involving anchoring of proteinases to the cell surface to regulate their biological activities.",,
29925589,Structural and functional analysis of Dickkopf 4 (Dkk4): New insights into Dkk evolution and regulation of Wnt signaling by Dkk and Kremen proteins.,"Dickkopf (Dkk) family proteins are important regulators of Wnt signaling pathways, which play key roles in many essential biological processes. Here, we report the first detailed structural and dynamics study of a full-length mature Dkk protein (Dkk4, residues 19-224), including determination of the first atomic-resolution structure for the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD1) conserved among Dkk proteins. We discovered that CRD1 has significant structural homology to the Dkk C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD2), pointing to multiple gene duplication events during Dkk family evolution. We also show that Dkk4 consists of two independent folded domains (CRD1 and CRD2) joined by a highly flexible, nonstructured linker. Similarly, the N-terminal region preceding CRD1 and containing a highly conserved N",,
12939143,"Structural and functional study of the apelin-13 peptide, an endogenous ligand of the HIV-1 coreceptor, APJ.","The APJ receptor is widely expressed in the human central nervous system (CNS). Apelin was recently identified as the endogenous peptidic ligand for human APJ. Studies with animal models suggested that APJ and apelin play an important role in the hypothalamic regulation of water intake and the endocrine axis, in the regulation of blood pressure, and in cardiac contractility. Apelin has been found to block the activity of APJ as a human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) coreceptor. In this study, we combined chemical synthetic approaches with alanine substitution to evaluate the structural requirements for interactions with the APJ receptor. We demonstrated that apelin peptides in aqueous solution adopt a random conformation, and the positive charge and hydrophobic residues of apelin-13 play important roles in interactions with the APJ receptor. We have observed an important correlation between receptor binding affinity and cell-cell fusion inhibitory activity. The elucidation of structural requirements of apelin-13 in its interaction with the APJ receptor is critical for further investigation of apelin-APJ functions in vivo and in the design of small molecular inhibitors for potential treatment of HIV-1 infection in the CNS.",,
12591959,Structural basis by which alternative splicing confers specificity in fibroblast growth factor receptors.,"Binding specificity between fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) is essential for mammalian development and is regulated primarily by two alternatively spliced exons, IIIb (""b"") and IIIc (""c""), that encode the second half of Ig-like domain 3 (D3) of FGFRs. FGF7 and FGF10 activate only the b isoform of FGFR2 (FGFR2b). Here, we report the crystal structure of the ligand-binding portion of FGFR2b bound to FGF10. Unique contacts between divergent regions in FGF10 and two b-specific loops in D3 reveal the structural basis by which alternative splicing provides FGF10-FGFR2b specificity. Structure-based mutagenesis of FGF10 confirms the importance of the observed contacts for FGF10 biological activity. Interestingly, FGF10 binding induces a previously unobserved rotation of receptor Ig domain 2 (D2) to introduce specific contacts with FGF10. Hence, both D2 and D3 of FGFR2b contribute to the exceptional specificity between FGF10 and FGFR2b. We propose that ligand-induced conformational change in FGFRs may also play an important role in determining specificity for other FGF-FGFR complexes.",,
16362042,Structural basis for Gas6-Axl signalling.,"Receptor tyrosine kinases of the Axl family are activated by the vitamin K-dependent protein Gas6. Axl signalling plays important roles in cancer, spermatogenesis, immunity, and platelet function. The crystal structure at 3.3 A resolution of a minimal human Gas6/Axl complex reveals an assembly of 2:2 stoichiometry, in which the two immunoglobulin-like domains of the Axl ectodomain are crosslinked by the first laminin G-like domain of Gas6, with no direct Axl/Axl or Gas6/Gas6 contacts. There are two distinct Gas6/Axl contacts of very different size, both featuring interactions between edge beta-strands. Structure-based mutagenesis, protein binding assays and receptor activation experiments demonstrate that both the major and minor Gas6 binding sites are required for productive transmembrane signalling. Gas6-mediated Axl dimerisation is likely to occur in two steps, with a high-affinity 1:1 Gas6/Axl complex forming first. Only the minor Gas6 binding site is highly conserved in the other Axl family receptors, Sky/Tyro3 and Mer. Specificity at the major contact is suggested to result from the segregation of charged and apolar residues to opposite faces of the newly formed beta-sheet.",The EMBO journal,2006
23938203,Structural basis for the interaction of human β-defensin 6 and its putative chemokine receptor CCR2 and breast cancer microvesicles.,"Human β-defensins (hBDs) are believed to function as alarm molecules that stimulate the adaptive immune system when a threat is present. In addition to its antimicrobial activity, defensins present other activities such as chemoattraction of a range of different cell types to the sites of inflammation. We have solved the structure of the hBD6 by NMR spectroscopy that contains a conserved β-defensin domain followed by an extended C-terminus. We use NMR to monitor the interaction of hBD6 with microvesicles shed by breast cancer cell lines and with peptides derived from the extracellular domain of CC chemokine receptor 2 (Nt-CCR2) possessing or not possessing sulfation on Tyr26 and Tyr28. The NMR-derived model of the hBD6/CCR2 complex reveals a contiguous binding surface on hBD6, which comprises amino acid residues of the α-helix and β2-β3 loop. The microvesicle binding surface partially overlaps with the chemokine receptor interface. NMR spin relaxation suggests that free hBD6 and the hBD6/CCR2 complex exhibit microsecond-to-millisecond conformational dynamics encompassing the CCR2 binding site, which might facilitate selection of the molecular configuration optimal for binding. These data offer new insights into the structure-function relation of the hBD6-CCR2 interaction, which is a promising target for the design of novel anticancer agents.",Journal of molecular biology,2013
27298358,Structural basis of adhesive binding by desmocollins and desmogleins.,"Desmosomes are intercellular adhesive junctions that impart strength to vertebrate tissues. Their dense, ordered intercellular attachments are formed by desmogleins (Dsgs) and desmocollins (Dscs), but the nature of trans-cellular interactions between these specialized cadherins is unclear. Here, using solution biophysics and coated-bead aggregation experiments, we demonstrate family-wise heterophilic specificity: All Dsgs form adhesive dimers with all Dscs, with affinities characteristic of each Dsg:Dsc pair. Crystal structures of ectodomains from Dsg2 and Dsg3 and from Dsc1 and Dsc2 show binding through a strand-swap mechanism similar to that of homophilic classical cadherins. However, conserved charged amino acids inhibit Dsg:Dsg and Dsc:Dsc interactions by same-charge repulsion and promote heterophilic Dsg:Dsc interactions through opposite-charge attraction. These findings show that Dsg:Dsc heterodimers represent the fundamental adhesive unit of desmosomes and provide a structural framework for understanding desmosome assembly.",,
27411955,Structural basis of transcobalamin recognition by human CD320 receptor.,"Cellular uptake of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) requires capture of transcobalamin (TC) from the plasma by CD320, a ubiquitous cell surface receptor of the LDLR family. Here we present the crystal structure of human holo-TC in complex with the extracellular domain of CD320, visualizing the structural basis of the TC-CD320 interaction. The observed interaction chemistry can rationalize the high affinity of CD320 for TC and lack of haptocorrin binding. The in vitro affinity and complex stability of TC-CD320 were quantitated using a solid-phase binding assay and thermostability analysis. Stable complexes with TC were also observed for the disease-causing CD320ΔE88 mutant and for the isolated LDLR-A2 domain. We also determined the structure of the TC-CD320ΔE88 complex, which revealed only minor changes compared with the wild-type complex. Finally, we demonstrate significantly reduced in vitro affinity of TC for CD320 at low pH, recapitulating the proposed ligand release during the endocytic pathway.",Nature communications,2016
10540231,"Structural characterization of mouse CD97 and study of its specific interaction with the murine decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD55).","CD97 is a newly identified, activation-associated human leucocyte antigen with seven putative transmembrane domains. It has an extended extracellular segment containing several adhesion molecule structure motifs, and has been shown to interact with the human complement regulator, decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD55). To understand further the interaction between CD97 and DAF, as well as the structure and function of CD97 in general, we have cloned the mouse CD97 cDNA and studied the encoded protein for its membrane association property and ability to interact specifically with the murine decay-accelerating factor. The full-length mouse CD97 cDNA that we have cloned and characterized encodes a protein that is 60% identical to the three epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain-containing form of human CD97 but does not contain the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif which is present in human CD97. Two other alternatively spliced forms of mouse CD97 were also identified. These forms differ by the number of EGF-like sequence repeats present in the N-terminal region. Northern blot analysis revealed that CD97 is expressed widely in mouse tissues and in resting as well as activated cultured mouse splenocytes. Transient transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with the mouse CD97 cDNA in a green-fluorescence protein vector (pEGFP-N1) showed plasma membrane targeting of the expressed protein. Western blot analysis confirmed its membrane association and identified the existence of a processed C-terminal fragment, supporting the notion that CD97 on the cell membrane is composed of post-translationally generated subunits. Adhesion studies demonstrated that normal, but not DAF knockout mouse erythrocytes and splenocytes adhered to mouse CD97-transfected HEK cells. The interaction of CD97 and DAF was found to be species-restrictive in that human erythrocytes were unable to bind to mouse CD97-transfected HEK cells. These results indicate that the general structure, membrane association property and DAF-binding ability of CD97 are conserved and that the adhesive interaction between CD97 and DAF is independent of the RGD motif. The finding that CD97 is distributed widely among various mouse tissues suggests that CD97 may have other roles beyond lymphocyte activation.",Immunology,1999
17452338,Structural determinants for ligand-receptor conformational selection in a peptide G protein-coupled receptor.,"G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulate the majority of physiological processes through specific intermolecular interactions with structurally diverse ligands and activation of differential intracellular signaling. A key issue yet to be resolved is how GPCRs developed selectivity and diversity of ligand binding and intracellular signaling during evolution. We have explored the structural basis of selectivity of naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRHs) from different species in the single functional human GnRH receptor. We found that the highly variable amino acids in position 8 of the naturally occurring isoforms of GnRH play a discriminating role in selecting receptor conformational states. The human GnRH receptor has a higher affinity for the cognate GnRH I but a lower affinity for GnRH II and GnRHs from other species possessing substitutions for Arg(8). The latter were partial agonists in the human GnRH receptor. Mutation of Asn(7.45) in transmembrane domain (TM) 7 had no effect on GnRH I affinity but specifically increased affinity for other GnRHs and converted them to full agonists. Using molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that the highly conserved Asn(7.45) makes intramolecular interactions with a highly conserved Cys(6.47) in TM 6, suggesting that disruption of this intramolecular interaction induces a receptor conformational change which allosterically alters ligand specific binding sites and changes ligand selectivity and signaling efficacy. These results reveal GnRH ligand and receptor structural elements for conformational selection, and support co-evolution of GnRH ligand and receptor conformations.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2007
21148085,Structural determinants of vascular endothelial growth factor-D receptor binding and specificity.,"Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and their tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGFR-1-3) are central mediators of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. VEGFR-3 ligands VEGF-C and VEGF-D are produced as precursor proteins with long N- and C-terminal propeptides and show enhanced VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 binding on proteolytic removal of the propeptides. Two different proteolytic cleavage sites have been reported in the VEGF-D N-terminus. We report here the crystal structure of the human VEGF-D Cys117Ala mutant at 2.9 Å resolution. Comparison of the VEGF-D and VEGF-C structures shows similar extended N-terminal helices, conserved overall folds, and VEGFR-2 interacting residues. Consistent with this, the affinity and the thermodynamic parameters for VEGFR-2 binding are very similar. In comparison with VEGF-C structures, however, the VEGF-D N-terminal helix was extended by 2 more turns because of a better resolution. Both receptor binding and functional assays of N-terminally truncated VEGF-D polypeptides indicated that the residues between the reported proteolytic cleavage sites are important for VEGF-D binding and activation of VEGFR-3, but not of VEGFR-2. Thus, we define here a VEGFR-2-specific form of VEGF-D that is angiogenic but not lymphangiogenic. These results provide important new insights into VEGF-D structure and function.",Blood,2011
20543817,Structural insights into the exquisite selectivity of neurexin/neuroligin synaptic interactions.,"The extracellular domains of neuroligins and neurexins interact through Ca(2+) to form flexible trans-synaptic associations characterized by selectivity for neuroligin or neurexin subtypes. This heterophilic interaction, essential for synaptic maturation and differentiation, is regulated by gene selection, alternative mRNA splicing and post-translational modifications. A new, 2.6 A-resolution crystal structure of a soluble neurexin-1beta-neuroligin-4 (Nrx1beta-NL4) complex permits a detailed description of the Ca(2+)-coordinated interface and unveils concerted positional rearrangements of several residues of NL4, not observed in neuroligin-1, associated with Nrx1beta binding. Surface plasmon resonance analysis of the binding of structure-guided Nrx1beta mutants towards NL4 and neuroligin-1 shows that flexibility of the Nrx1beta-binding site in NL4 is reflected in a greater dissociation constant of the complex and higher sensitivity to ionic strength and pH variations. Analysis of neuroligin mutants points to critical functions for two respective residues in neuroligin-1 and neuroligin-2 in governing the affinity of the complexes. Although neuroligin-1 and neuroligin-2 have pre-determined conformations that respectively promote and prevent Nrx1beta association, unique conformational reshaping of the NL4 surface is required to permit Nrx1beta association.",,
10618369,Structural interactions of fibroblast growth factor receptor with its ligands.,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) effect cellular responses by binding to FGF receptors (FGFRs). FGF bound to extracellular domains on the FGFR in the presence of heparin activates the cytoplasmic receptor tyrosine kinase through autophosphorylation. We have crystallized a complex between human FGF1 and a two-domain extracellular fragment of human FGFR2. The crystal structure, determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction analysis of the selenomethionyl protein, is a dimeric assemblage of 1:1 ligand:receptor complexes. FGF is bound at the junction between the two domains of one FGFR, and two such units are associated through receptor:receptor and secondary ligand:receptor interfaces. Sulfate ion positions appear to mark the course of heparin binding between FGF molecules through a basic region on receptor D2 domains. This dimeric assemblage provides a structural mechanism for FGF signal transduction.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2000
10100920,Structural motifs of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) defining PAC1-receptor selectivity.,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) interacts with three types of PACAP/VIP-receptors. The PAC1-receptor accepts PACAP as a high affinity ligand but not vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) similarly binding to VPAC1- and VPAC2-receptors. To identify those amino acids not present in VIP defining PAC1-receptor selectivity of PACAP, radio receptor binding assays on AR4-2J cells were performed. It could be shown that PACAP(1-27) exhibited a distinct and much higher susceptibility to VIP-amino acid substitutions, compared to PACAP(1-38). Positions 4 and 5 seem to be most important for receptor binding of PACAP(1-27), whereas position 13 was identified to be crucial for maximal affinity of PACAP(1-38). PACAP(29-38) extension analogues of VIP revealed a stabilizing effect of the C-terminus of PACAP(1-38) on the optimal peptide conformation. The substitution analogues were also checked for their capacity to stimulate IP3 and cAMP formation in AR4-2J cells. Compared to PACAP(1-27) and PACAP(1-38), most analogues revealed potencies reduced congruously to their lower binding affinities. However, one of the analogues, PACAP(1-27) substituted in position 5, may represent a weak antagonist since this peptide was less potent in inducing second messengers than in label displacement. Our findings indicate that PACAP(1-27) and PACAP(1-38) differ in terms of their requirement of the amino acids in positions 4, 5, 9, 11 and 13 for maximal interaction with the PAC1-receptor.",Regulatory peptides,1999
8699246,Structure and evolution of neurexophilin.,"Using affinity chromatography on immobilized alpha-latrotoxin, we have purified a novel 29 kDa protein, neurexophilin, in a complex with neurexin l alpha. Cloning revealed that rat and bovine neurexophilins are composed of N-terminal signal peptides, nonconserved N-terminal domains (20% identity over 80 residues), and highly homologous C-terminal sequences (85% identity over 169 residues). Analysis of genomic clones from mice identified two distinct neurexophilin genes, one of which is more homologous to rat neurexophilin and the other to bovine neurexophilin. The first neurexophilin gene is expressed abundantly in adult rat and mouse brain, whereas no mRNA corresponding to the second gene was detected in rodents despite its abundant expression in bovine brain, suggesting that rodents and cattle primarily express distinct neurexophilin genes. RNA blots and in situ hybridizations revealed that neurexophilin is expressed in adult rat brain at high levels only in a scattered subpopulation of neurons that probably represent inhibitory interneurons; by contrast, neurexins are expressed in all neurons. Neurexophilin contains a signal sequence and is N-glycosylated at multiple sites, suggesting that it is secreted and binds to the extracellular domain of neurexin l alpha. This hypothesis was confirmed by binding recombinant neurexophilin to the extracellular domains of neurexin l alpha. Together our data suggest that neurexophilin constitutes a secreted glycoprotein that is synthesized in a subclass of neurons and may be a ligand for neurexins.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,1996
1313946,Structure and expression of a human oxytocin receptor.,"Just before the onset of labour, uterine myometrium becomes extremely sensitive to oxytocin, for which it is a primary target tissue, because of a dramatic increase in the number of oxytocin receptors. We report here the structure and expression of the human oxytocin receptor complementary DNA isolated by expression cloning. The encoded receptor is a 388-amino-acid polypeptide with 7 transmembrane domains typical of G protein-coupled receptors. The oxytocin receptor, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, specifically responds to oxytocin and induces an inward membrane current. Messenger RNAs for the receptor are of two sizes, 3.6 kilobases in breast, and 4.4 kilobases in ovary, uterine endometrium and myometrium. The mRNA level in the myometrium is very high at term. We conclude that the increase in receptor number in the myometrium at labour is, at least in part, due to the increase in mRNA.",Nature,1992
2466334,Structure and function of human amphiregulin: a member of the epidermal growth factor family.,"The complete amino acid sequence of amphiregulin, a bifunctional cell growth modulator, was determined. The truncated form contains 78 amino acids, whereas a larger form of amphiregulin contains six additional amino acids at the amino-terminal end. The amino-terminal half of amphiregulin is extremely hydrophilic and contains unusually high numbers of lysine, arginine, and asparagine residues. The carboxyl-terminal half of amphiregulin (residues 46 to 84) exhibits striking homology to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of proteins. Amphiregulin binds to the EGF receptor but not as well as EGF does.

Effects of leukocyte elastase and other proteases on platelets response to von Willebrand factor and thrombin.,"Treatment of platelets with human leukocyte elastase causes a rapid loss in response to von Willebrand factor and a biphasic loss in response to thrombin, first rapid then more slowly. The rapid phase corresponds to cleavage of a 45-kDa glycopeptide from the extracellular end of membrane glycoprotein GPIb. Longer treatment removes 80-kDa and 90-kDa glycopeptides and a glycopeptide corresponding to the major part of GPV. The 45-kDa and 90-kDa species could be obtained by elastase treatment of glycocalicin, the major proteolytic cleavage product of GPIb. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the purified 45-kDa glycopeptide had the same effect on the action of von Willebrand factor and thrombin on platelets as cleavage of GPIb by elastase. These results indicate that both the von Willebrand factor and thrombin binding sites on GPIb are located in the same region on the outside of the molecule. Thrombin activation of platelets involves at least two receptors, one on the 45-kDa glycopeptide, which when occupied causes an increase in the speed of response of the platelets to the cleavage of the second. GPV, a candidate for the second receptor, is a hydrophobic glycoprotein that is cleaved from the platelet membrane by several proteases. Proteases that do not activate platelets but degrade the second receptor remove larger fragments from GPV than do proteases such as thrombin or trypsin which activate platelets.",,
1840701,Structure and functional expression of a human interleukin-8 receptor.,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a member of a family of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although the best characterized activities of IL-8 include the chemoattraction and activation of neutrophils, other members of this family have a wide range of specific actions including the chemotaxis and activation of monocytes, the selective chemotaxis of memory T cells, the inhibition of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, and the induction of neutrophil infiltration in vivo. A complementary DNA encoding the IL-8 receptor from human neutrophils has now been isolated. The amino acid sequence shows that the receptor is a member of the superfamily of receptors that couple to guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). The sequence is 29% identical to that of receptors for the other neutrophil chemoattractants, fMet-Leu-Phe and C5a. Mammalian cells transfected with the IL-8 receptor cDNA clone bind IL-8 with high affinity and respond specifically to IL-8 by transiently mobilizing calcium. The IL-8 receptor may be part of a subfamily of related G protein-coupled receptors that transduce signals for the IL-8 family of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1991
1694443,Structure and functional expression of the cloned rat neurotensin receptor.,"A functional cDNA clone for the rat neurotensin receptor was isolated by combining molecular cloning in an RNA expression vector with an electrophysiological assay in Xenopus oocytes. The neurotensin receptor consists of 424 amino acids with seven putative transmembrane domains and belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. The cloned receptor expressed in mammalian cells or in Xenopus oocytes shows a selective and high-affinity binding to neurotensin peptides and undergoes potent desensitization by repeated application of neurotensin. The neurotensin receptor mRNA is expressed in both the brain and the peripheral tissues at different levels. This investigation discloses the molecular nature of the neurotensin receptor, which mediates the diverse neuronal and peripheral actions of neurotensin by effecting the G protein-associated second messenger system.",Neuron,1990

Y-receptor subtype ligand binding data are used in conjunction with structural data to develop a model for receptor subtype selective agonists. For PYY it is proposed that potent binding to Y1, Y4 and Y5 receptors requires the juxtaposition of the two termini while Y2 binding only requires the C-terminal helix. Further experiments that delineate between primary and tertiary structure contributions for receptor binding and activation are required to support the hypothesis that tertiary structure is stable enough to influence the expression of PYY's bioactivity.",Peptides,2002
9925787,Structure of extracellular tissue factor complexed with factor VIIa inhibited with a BPTI mutant.,"The event that initiates the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation is the association of coagulation factor VIIa (VIIa) with its cell-bound receptor, tissue factor (TF), exposed to blood circulation following tissue injury and/or vascular damage. The natural inhibitor of the TF.VIIa complex is the first Kunitz domain of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI-K1). The structure of TF. VIIa reversibly inhibited with a potent (Ki=0.4 nM) bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) mutant (5L15), a homolog of TFPI-K1, has been determined at 2.1 A resolution. When bound to TF, the four domain VIIa molecule assumes an extended conformation with its light chain wrapping around the framework of the two domain TF cofactor. The 5L15 inhibitor associates with the active site of VIIa similar to trypsin-bound BPTI, but makes several unique interactions near the perimeter of the site that are not observed in the latter. Most of the interactions are polar and involve mutated positions of 5L15. Of the eight rationally engineered mutations distinguishing 5L15 from BPTI, seven are involved in productive interactions stabilizing the enzyme-inhibitor association with four contributing contacts unique to the VIIa.5L15 complex. Two additional unique interactions are due to distinguishing residues in the VIIa sequence: a salt bridge between Arg20 of 5L15 and Asp60 of an insertion loop of VIIa, and a hydrogen bond between Tyr34O of the inhibitor and Lys192NZ of the enzyme. These interactions were used further to model binding of TFPI-K1 to VIIa and TFPI-K2 to factor Xa, the principal activation product of TF.VIIa. The structure of the ternary protein complex identifies the determinants important for binding within and near the active site of VIIa, and provides cogent information for addressing the manner in which substrates of VIIa are bound and hydrolyzed in blood coagulation. It should also provide guidance in structure-aided drug design for the discovery of potent and selective small molecule VIIa inhibitors.",Journal of molecular biology,1999
12118248,"Structure of human CD1b with bound ligands at 2.3 A, a maze for alkyl chains.","The human genome encodes five nonpolymorphic major histocompatibility complex class I-like glycoproteins, CD1a to CD1e, that present lipid antigens for specific recognition by T lymphocytes. Using single alkyl chain detergents, we developed a protocol to generate recombinant human CD1b-lipid complexes. We present here the crystal structures of CD1b in complex with either phosphatidylinositol or ganglioside GM2 at 2.3 A and 2.8 A resolutions, respectively. The antigen-binding groove houses four interlinked hydrophobic channels that are occupied by the alkyl chains of the glycolipid plus two detergent molecules. A distinct exit beneath the alpha 2 helix further contributes to the plasticity of the binding groove. These structures reveal the mechanism by which two alkyl chain lipids bind to CD1b, and how CD1b can adapt to ligands of different alkyl chain length. They also suggest how very long alkyl chains, such as those of mycolic acid, could be fully contained within the binding groove. These results extend the spectrum of potential CD1b ligands by revealing that, in addition to two alkyl chain lipids, mono-alkyl and triple-alkyl chain lipids can be accommodated in the binding groove.",Nature immunology,2002

19604491,Structure of natural killer cell receptor KLRG1 bound to E-cadherin reveals basis for MHC-independent missing self recognition.,"The cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells is regulated by inhibitory receptors that detect the absence of self molecules on target cells. Structural studies of missing self recognition have focused on NK receptors that bind MHC. However, NK cells also possess inhibitory receptors specific for non-MHC ligands, notably cadherins, which are downregulated in metastatic tumors. We determined the structure of killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) in complex with E-cadherin. KLRG1 mediates missing self recognition by binding to a highly conserved site on classical cadherins, enabling it to monitor expression of several cadherins (E-, N-, and R-) on target cells. This site overlaps the site responsible for cell-cell adhesion but is distinct from the integrin alpha(E)beta(7) binding site. We propose that E-cadherin may coengage KLRG1 and alpha(E)beta(7) and that KLRG1 overcomes its exceptionally weak affinity for cadherins through multipoint attachment to target cells, resulting in inhibitory signaling.",Immunity,2009

11698684,Structure of the interferon-receptor complex determined by distance constraints from double-mutant cycles and flexible docking.,"The pleiotropic activity of type I interferons has been attributed to the specific interaction of IFN with the cell-surface receptor components ifnar1 and ifnar2. To date, the structure of IFN has been solved, but not that of the receptor or the complex. In this study, the structure of the IFN-alpha 2-ifnar2 complex was generated with a docking procedure, using nuclear Overhauser effect-like distance constraints obtained from double-mutant cycle experiments. The interaction free energy between 13 residues of the ligand and 11 of the receptor was measured by double-mutant cycles. Of the 100 pairwise interactions probed, five pairs of residues were found to interact. These five interactions were incorporated as distance constraints into the flexible docking program prodock by using fixed and movable energy-gradient grids attached to the receptor and ligand, respectively. Multistart minimization and Monte Carlo minimization docking of IFN-alpha 2 onto ifnar2 converged to a well-defined average structure, with the five distance constraints being satisfied. Furthermore, no structural artifacts or intraloop energy strain were observed. The mutual binding sites on IFN-alpha 2 and ifnar2 predicted from the model showed an almost complete superposition with the ones determined from mutagenesis studies. Based on this structure, differences in IFN-alpha 2 versus IFN-beta binding are discussed.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2001

11137709,Structure-activity relationships of neurokinin A (4-10) at the human tachykinin NK(2) receptor: the role of natural residues and their chirality.,"A structure-activity study of neurokinin A (NKA) (4-10) was performed to investigate the importance of residue and chirality for affinity and efficacy at the NK(2) receptor in human colon circular muscle. Two series of NKA(4-10) analogues were produced with either L-alanine or the D-enantiomer substituted. Their activities were determined in vitro by means of radioligand binding and isolated smooth muscle pharmacology. NKA was more potent than NKA(4-10) at the human, unlike the rabbit, NK(2) receptor. The contractile response of NKA(4-10) was unaffected by N-terminal acetylation. L-Ala substitution of Asp(4), Val(7), Leu(9), and Met(10) caused an 8- to 80-fold decrease, and substitution of Phe(6) caused a 5000-fold decrease in binding affinity (P < 0.01). Positions Ser(5) and Gly(8) were not significantly affected. In functional studies, a similar pattern was observed. The replacement of residues with their respective D-enantiomer drastically reduced binding affinity and functional potency, particularly at positions 6 and 7 (P < 0.05). NKA(4-10) analogues L-Ala(6), L-Ala(8), D-Phe(6), D-Val(7), and D-Met(10) were partial agonists. An excellent correlation was observed between binding and functional data (r = 0.95). A retro-inverso analogue of NKA(4-10) was inactive. In conclusion, the side chains of Asp(4), Phe(6), Val(7), Leu(9), and Met(10) are structurally important features of NKA(4-10) for agonist activity, and changes in amino acid chirality are detrimental to binding affinity and functional activity. Overall, our data are broadly similar to those of previous studies in the rat. However, at the human NK(2) receptor, unlike the rat, [Ala(8)]NKA(4-10) was an antagonist.",,
10382758,"Structure-activity relationships within the N-terminal short consensus repeats (SCR) of human CR1 (C3b/C4b receptor, CD35): SCR 3 plays a critical role in inhibition of the classical and alternative pathways of complement activation.","Genes coding for between one and four short consensus repeats (SCR) of the N-terminal region of human complement receptor 1 (CR1) were synthesized from oligonucleotides and those encoding SCR(1-2), SCR(1-3), SCR(1-4), SCR3 and SCR(3-4) were expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Following solubilization in urea, the proteins were partially purified and refolded and the activity of each protein was assessed in both classical and alternative pathway complement assays. All fragments showed a varying degree of activity with the general order being SCR(1-3) = SCR(1-4) > SCR(1-2). Addition of SCR3 to SCR(1-2) significantly improved potency, whereas the addition of SCR4 conferred no additional benefit. This observation, coupled with the ability of the single-domain SCR3 to inhibit classical pathway mediated lysis with an IH50% (inhibition of hemolysis by 50%) of 4.8 microM, demonstrates that SCR3 provides key binding interactions with activated complement components. SCR(1-3) was able to inhibit both classical and alternative pathways of complement activation, showing that the N-terminal SCR of CR1 retain the ability to interact with C3b. Assays for CR1-like cofactor activity for factor I using C4b-like C4 or C3b-like C3 as substrates showed that SCR(1-3) possessed such cofactor activity and that C4b-like C4 was a better substrate. When compared to full-length (30 SCR) soluble CR1 (sCR1), SCR(1-3) was significantly less potent in accord with a model involving multi-valent binding of C3b/C4b to CR1.",European journal of immunology,1999

12627975,Structure-function analysis of a series of novel GIP analogues containing different helical length linkers.,"Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP1-42) is a potent glucose-lowering intestinal peptide hormone. The equipotent GIP1-30NH2 was structurally modified by linking N- and C-terminal fragments with several different linkers. Substitution of the middle region of GIP by a flexible aminohexanoic linker resulted in greatly reduced binding affinity and reduction or complete loss of bioactivity. Connection of the bioactive domains GIP1-14 and GIP19-30NH2 by EKEK or AAAA linkers resulted in peptide agonists with approximately 3-4-fold increased bioactivity as compared to GIP1-30NH2. Conformational analysis by CD spectroscopy of GIP fragments and analogues suggests a helical region in the C-terminal (19-30) portion of GIP. It was demonstrated that stabilization of this C-terminal helical region by the introduction of helical linkers favored binding and activation of the GIP receptor. Our results suggest an important contribution of a direct interaction of the first 14 amino acids with the GIP receptor, an appropriate relative orientation of N- and C-terminal parts of GIP, and the presence of helical linkers to be essential for bioactivity.",Biochemistry,2003
9651358,Structure-function analysis of FLT3 ligand-FLT3 receptor interactions using a rapid functional screen.,"FLT3 ligand (FLT3L) stimulates primitive hematopoietic cells by binding to and activating the FLT3 receptor (FLT3R). We carried out a structure-activity study of human FLT3L in order to define the residues involved in receptor binding. We developed a rapid method to screen randomly mutagenized FLT3L using a FLT3R-Fc fusion protein to probe the relative binding activities of mutated ligand. Approximately 60,000 potential mutants were screened, and the DNA from 59 clones was sequenced. Thirty-one single amino acid substitutions at 24 positions of FLT3L either enhanced or reduced activity in receptor binding and cell proliferation assays. Eleven representative proteins were purified and analyzed for receptor affinity, specific activity, and physical properties. Receptor affinity and bioactivity were highly correlated. FLT3L affinity for receptor improved when four individual mutations that enhance FLT3L receptor affinity were combined in a single molecule. A model of FLT3L three-dimensional structure was generated based on sequence alignment and x-ray structure of macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Most residues implicated in receptor binding are widely dispersed in the primary structure of FLT3L, yet they localize to a surface patch in the tertiary model. A mutation that maps to and is predicted to disrupt the proposed dimerization interface between FLT3L monomers exhibits a Stokes radius that is concentration-dependent, suggesting that this mutation disrupts the FLT3L dimer.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
9233649,Structure-function analysis of the integrin beta 7 subunit: identification of domains involved in adhesion to MAdCAM-1.,"Beta 7 integrins serve special roles in mucosal immunity. Alpha 4 beta 7-mediated adhesion to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) directs lymphocyte homing to the gut, and alpha E beta 7 mediates binding of lymphocytes to E-cadherin on epithelial cells. Since alpha 4 beta 7 mediates adhesion to MAdCAM-1 but alpha 4 beta 1 does not, we used beta 7/beta 1 chimeras to directly assess the importance of specific regions of beta 7 in MAdCAM-1 binding. We found a region of beta 7 (residues 46-386) that accounts for specificity of alpha 4 beta 7 binding to MAdCAM-1. We also used human/mouse and human/rat chimeric beta 7 subunits to map epitopes recognized by fifteen anti-beta 7 mAbs. Six of seven Abs that block adhesion to MAdCAM-1 and E-cadherin (Fib 21, 22, 27, 30, 504; Act-1) mapped to amino acid residues 176-250. Residues 176-250 lie within the region of beta 7 that specifies MAdCAM-1 binding and also within a region that has a predicted structure homologous to the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) domains of the integrin subunits alpha L and alpha M. Three new Abs that recognize beta 7 in the presence of Mn2+, but not Ca2+, and promote adhesion to MAdCAM-1, mapped to amino acids 46-149. One blocking and five other Abs mapped to other regions (amino acids 387-725). We conclude that a MIDAS-like domain serves a critical role in beta 7 integrin-mediated adhesion.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1997

19084540,Structure-function relationship of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and its receptor interaction based on 3D structural analysis of a fully active TNFR1-selective TNF mutant.,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important cytokine that suppresses carcinogenesis and excludes infectious pathogens to maintain homeostasis. TNF activates its two receptors [TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 and TNFR2], but the contribution of each receptor to various host defense functions and immunologic surveillance is not yet clear. Here, we used phage display techniques to generate receptor-selective TNF mutants that activate only one TNFR. These TNF mutants will be useful in the functional analysis of TNFR. Six amino acids in the receptor binding interface (near TNF residues 30, 80, and 140) were randomly mutated by polymerase chain reaction. Two phage libraries comprising over 5 million TNF mutants were constructed. By selecting the mutants without affinity for TNFR1 or TNFR2, we successfully isolated 4 TNFR2-selective candidates and 16 TNFR1-selective candidates, respectively. The TNFR1-selective candidates were highly mutated near residue 30, whereas TNFR2-selective candidates were highly mutated near residue 140, although both had conserved sequences near residues 140 and 30, respectively. This finding suggested that the phage display technique was suitable for identifying important regions for the TNF interaction with TNFR1 and TNFR2. Purified clone R1-6, a TNFR1-selective candidate, remained fully bioactive and had full affinity for TNFR1 without activating TNFR2, indicating the usefulness of the R1-6 TNF mutant in analyzing TNFR1 receptor function. To further elucidate the receptor selectivity of R1-6, we examined the structure of R1-6 by X-ray crystallography. The results suggested that R31A and R32G mutations strongly influenced electrostatic interaction with TNFR2, and that L29K mutation contributed to the binding of R1-6 to TNFR1. This phage display technique can be used to efficiently construct functional mutants for analysis of the TNF structure-function relationship, which might facilitate in silico drug design based on receptor selectivity.",Journal of molecular biology,2009
11726197,Structure-function studies of linear and cyclized peptide antagonists of the GnRH receptor.,"Structurally new analogs of the peptidic GnRH receptor antagonist Cetrorelix as well as conformationally constrained cyclized deca- or pentapeptides were synthesized and selected peptides evaluated comprehensively. To understand how structural variations of the antagonistic peptide effect pharmacodynamic properties, binding affinities and antagonistic potencies toward the human and rat GnRH receptor were determined. Whereas large substituents in position 6 of linear peptides are compatible with high binding affinity (K(D) < 0.5 nM), all cyclized peptides except the cyclo[3-10] analog D-52391 depicted low binding affinity (K(D) > 10 nM). Binding affinity and antagonistic potency in vitro correlated for all peptides and surprisingly no discrimination between human and rat receptor proteins was observed. Since receptor residues W(101) and N(102) are involved in agonist and antagonist binding, equally potent but structurally different antagonists were tested for binding to the respective W(101)A and N(102)A mutants. In contrast to linear decapeptides, residues N(102) and W(101) are not involved in binding of D-23938 and W(101) is the critical residue for D-52391 binding. We conclude that although equally potent, peptidic GnRH receptor antagonists do have distinct interactions within the ligand binding pocket. Finally, selected antagonists were tested for testosterone suppression in male rats. The duration of testosterone suppression below castration levels differed largely from 1 day for Ganirelix to 27 days for D-23487. Systemic availability became evident as the most important parameter for in vivo efficacy.",,

26146185,Structures of CD6 and Its Ligand CD166 Give Insight into Their Interaction.,"CD6 is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular region containing three scavenger receptor cysteine rich (SRCR) domains. The membrane proximal domain of CD6 binds the N-terminal immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domain of another cell surface receptor, CD166, which also engages in homophilic interactions. CD6 expression is mainly restricted to T cells, and the interaction between CD6 and CD166 regulates T-cell activation. We have solved the X-ray crystal structures of the three SRCR domains of CD6 and two N-terminal domains of CD166. This first structure of consecutive SRCR domains reveals a nonlinear organization. We characterized the binding sites on CD6 and CD166 and showed that a SNP in CD6 causes glycosylation that hinders the CD6/CD166 interaction. Native mass spectrometry analysis showed that there is competition between the heterophilic and homophilic interactions. These data give insight into how interactions of consecutive SRCR domains are perturbed by SNPs and potential therapeutic reagents.","Structure (London, England : 1993)",2015

Structures of the N-terminal ligand binding domain of the murine mTIM-1 and mTIM-2 receptors revealed an immunoglobulin (Ig) fold, with four Cys residues bridging a distinctive CC' loop to the GFC beta-sheet. The structures showed two ligand-recognition modes in the TIM family. The mTIM-1 structure identified a homophilic TIM-TIM adhesion interaction, whereas the mTIM-2 domain formed a dimer that prevented homophilic binding. Biochemical, mutational, and cell adhesion analyses confirmed the divergent ligand-binding modes revealed by the structures. Structural features characteristic of mTIM-1 appear conserved in human TIM-1, which also mediated homophilic interactions. The extracellular mucin domain enhanced binding through the Ig domain, modulating TIM receptor functions.

TARC interacts primarily with the CCR4 receptor and to a lesser extent with the CCR8 receptor. The structures of TARC have been solved by molecular replacement in two space groups, triclinic (P1) and tetragonal (P4(1)), and refined to resolutions of 1.72 and 2.1 A, respectively, with R factors of 19.8% (R(free) = 24.1%) and 19.8% (R(free) = 27.7%), respectively. The search model originated from the crystal structure of another chemokine, RANTES, and proved to be only modestly similar to the refined structure of TARC. Whereas the tetragonal structure was easily solved using the program AMoRe, solution of the triclinic structure proved to be quite challenging and was obtained by combining the results from four different molecular-replacement programs (AMoRe, CNS, BEAST and EPMR), with subsequent extension of the gathered information. The tertiary structure of TARC is similar to that of other CC chemokines, with a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet flanked by a C-terminal helix. Both quaternary structures consist of dimers, which in the triclinic crystals pack further into tetramers.

Here, we present crystal structures of the ZNRF3 ectodomain and its complex with R-spondin 1 (RSPO1). ZNRF3 binds RSPO1 and LGR5-RSPO1 with micromolar affinity via RSPO1 furin-like 1 (Fu1) domain. Anonychia-related mutations in RSPO4 support the importance of the observed interface. The ZNRF3-RSPO1 structure resembles that of LGR5-RSPO1-RNF43, though Fu2 of RSPO1 is variably oriented. The ZNRF3-binding site overlaps with trans-interactions observed in 2:2 LGR5-RSPO1 complexes, thus binding of ZNRF3/RNF43 would disrupt such an arrangement. Sequence conservation suggests a single ligand-binding site on ZNRF3, consistent with the proposed competing binding role of ZNRF3/RNF43 in Wnt signaling.",PloS one,2013
8576240,"Structures, alternative splicing, and neurexin binding of multiple neuroligins.","Neuroligin 1 is a neuronal cell surface protein that binds to a subset of neurexins, polymorphic cell surface proteins that are also localized on neurons (Ichtchenko, K., Hata, Y., Nguyen, T., Ullrich, B., Missler, M., Moomaw, C., and Südhof, T. C. (1995) Cell 81, 435-443). We now describe two novel neuroligins called neuroligins 2 and 3 that are similar in structure and sequence to neuroligin 1. All neuroligins contain an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence with the characteristics of a cleaved signal peptide followed by a large esterase homology domain, a highly conserved single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic domain. The three neuroligins are alternatively spliced at the same position and are expressed at high levels only in brain. Binding studies demonstrate that all three neuroligins bind to beta-neurexins both as native brain proteins and as recombinant proteins. Tight binding of the three neuroligins to beta-neurexins is observed only for beta-neurexins lacking an insert in splice site 4. Thus, neuroligins constitute a multigene family of brain-specific proteins with distinct isoforms that may have overlapping functions in mediating recognition processes between neurons.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
9662041,Studies on the betacellulin receptor in pancreatic AR42J cells.,"Betacellulin is a member of the epidermal growth factor family and converts pancreatic AR42J cells into insulin-producing cells. This study was conducted to characterise the receptor for betacellulin in AR42J cells. AR42J cells expressed two classes of binding sites for radioactive iodine labelled betacellulin, with Kd values of 4.6 x 10(-11) mol/l and 3.0 x 10(-10) mol/l. The binding of [125I]betacellulin was inhibited by unlabelled betacellulin in a dose-dependent manner, but epidermal growth factor was 50 fold less effective than betacellulin. Affinity cross-linking showed a [125I]betacellulin-binding protein with a molecular weight of approximately 180 KDa. When this protein was immunoprecipitated with antibody against epidermal growth factor receptors ErbB-1, ErbB-2, ErbB-3 or ErbB-4, it was immunoprecipitated only by the anti-ErbB-1 antibody. When the [125I]betacellulin-labelled proteins were immunoprecipitated with a combination of the four ErbB antibodies, and the unprecipitated proteins were then immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, a 190 KDa protein was observed. Betacellulin induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-1, ErbB-2 and ErbB-4. Finally, while 100 pmol/1 betacellulin converted all of the AR42J into insulin-producing cells in the presence of activin A, 10 nmol/l epidermal growth factor induced differentiation in only about 30 % of the cells. Higher concentrations of epidermal growth factor were less effective. Neu differentiation factor in the presence or absence of epidermal growth factor was ineffective. These results indicate that betacellulin binds to ErbB-1 and possibly another protein with a molecular weight of 190 KDa. The latter betacellulin-binding protein may be involved in the differentiation-inducing activity of betacellulin.",,
6336654,Studies with a murine monoclonal antibody that abolishes ristocetin-induced binding of von Willebrand factor to platelets: additional evidence in support of GPIb as a platelet receptor for von Willebrand factor.,"A murine monoclonal antibody directed at or near a platelet membrane receptor for the von Willebrand factor was produced by the hybridoma technique. Purified F(ab')2 fragments and/or intact antibody completely blocked the agglutination of platelets induced by both ristocetin and bovine von Willebrand factor and the binding of von Willebrand factor antigen to platelets. The antibody also decreased platelet retention, prevented the reduction in platelet electrophoretic mobility caused by bovine von Willebrand factor, and decreased the serum prothrombin time. Radiolabeled F(ab')2 fragments bound to or approximately 2.5 X 10(4) sites on normal platelets with high affinity (KD or approximately 1.5 X 10(-8) M); there was no binding to platelets from 2 patients with the Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography studies indicated that the antibody binds to glycoprotein lb at a site contained on the externally oriented portion of the GPIb alpha chain (glycocalicin).

11994538,"Study of the HIV-1 receptors CD4, CXCR4, CCR5 and CCR3 in the human and rat testis.","Sexual transmission of HIV is one of the main routes of transmission of AIDS. Despite the fact that the virus has been found in the semen and germ cells of patients with HIV, little is known about how the virus infects the cells of the genital tract. We studied the cellular distribution of CD4, a receptor necessary for HIV infection, and the major HIV co-receptors CCR3, CCR5 and CXCR4 in the rat and human testis. We used RT-PCR, Northern blotting and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that CCR3 is absent from the testes of both species, whereas CCR5 and CXCR4 are present on the resident testicular macrophages in the interstitial space but not in the germ cell line. All of the human testicular macrophages expressed the markers CD45 and MAC387 and most also expressed CD4. Thus, our data suggest that macrophages in the testis may be infected by HIV and that these macrophages may be a site of early viral localization and a potential HIV reservoir. This may in turn alter the activity of Leydig cells and subsequently affect spermatogenesis.",,
8702971,Substrate recognition by tissue factor-factor VIIa. Evidence for interaction of residues Lys165 and Lys166 of tissue factor with the 4-carboxyglutamate-rich domain of factor X.,"Tissue factor (TF) is the protein cofactor for factor VIIa (FVIIa), the first serine protease of the clotting cascade. Previous studies using alanine mutagenesis have identified TF residues Lys165 and Lys166 as important for factor X (FX) activation, hypothesizing either that these residues interact with phospholipid head groups or that they directly or indirectly promote macromolecular substrate binding. In the recently reported x-ray crystal structure of the isolated extracellular domain of TF, both Lys165 and Lys166 are solvent-exposed and predicted to be near the phospholipid surface in intact TF. We hypothesized that these residues may in fact be ideally positioned to interact with the 4-carboxyglutamate-rich domain (Gla domain) of FX. We therefore predicted that mutations at Lys165 and Lys166 should have no effect on the activation of Gla domainless FX. To test this hypothesis, we mutated both residues Lys165 and Lys166 of TF to Ala, Glu, or Gln and examined the ability of these double mutants to support FVIIa-mediated activation of FX, Gla domainless FX, and factor IX (FIX). Each TF mutant was equivalent to wild-type TF in both FVIIa binding and promotion of FVIIa amidolytic activity. However, all three mutants were markedly deficient in supporting FIX and FX activation, with FX activation rates decreased more than FIX activation rates. In both reactions, the TF mutants exhibited different extents of activity: Gln165-Gln166 > Ala165-Ala166 > Glu165-Glu166. In sharp contrast, all three TF mutants were equivalent to wild-type TF in supporting activation of Gla domainless FX by FVIIa. Interestingly, the deficiency of the mutants in FX activation was less pronounced when Gla domainless FVIIa was used in place of native FVIIa. Together, these findings suggest that TF residues Lys165 and Lys166 contribute to a binding site for the Gla domain of FX (and perhaps other substrates) and that this interaction may be facilitated by the presence of the Gla domain of FVIIa.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
10835423,Substrate specificity of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-mediated cell migration and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation.,"The alpha(v)beta(3) integrin has been shown to bind several ligands, including osteopontin and vitronectin. Its role in modulating cell migration and downstream signaling pathways in response to specific extracellular matrix ligands has been investigated in this study. Highly invasive prostate cancer PC3 cells that constitutively express alpha(v)beta(3) adhere and migrate on osteopontin and vitronectin in an alpha(v)beta(3)-dependent manner. However, exogenous expression of alpha(v)beta(3) in noninvasive prostate cancer LNCaP (beta(3)-LNCaP) cells mediates adhesion and migration on vitronectin but not on osteopontin. Activation of alpha(v)beta(3) by epidermal growth factor stimulation is required to mediate adhesion to osteopontin but is not sufficient to support migration on this substrate. We show that alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated cell migration requires activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) pathway since wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, prevents PC3 cell migration on both osteopontin and vitronectin; furthermore, alpha(v)beta(3) engagement by osteopontin and vitronectin activates the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway. Migration of beta(3)-LNCaP cells on vitronectin also occurs through activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway; however, AKT phosphorylation is not increased upon engagement by osteopontin. Furthermore, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), known to support cell migration in beta(3)-LNCaP cells, is detected on both substrates. Thus, in PC3 cells, alpha(v)beta(3) mediates cell migration and PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation on vitronectin and osteopontin; in beta(3)-LNCaP cells, alpha(v)beta(3) mediates cell migration and PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation on vitronectin, whereas adhesion to osteopontin does not support alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated cell migration and PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation. We conclude therefore that alpha(v)beta(3) exists in multiple functional states that can bind either selectively vitronectin or both vitronectin and osteopontin and that can differentially activate cell migration and intracellular signaling pathways in a ligand-specific manner.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
7988476,Subtype selectivity of peptide analogs for all five cloned human somatostatin receptors (hsstr 1-5).,"Recent reports (Raynor et al) have claimed the identification of potent somatostatin (SST) agonists exhibiting binding affinities of 1-2 pM and up to 30,000 fold binding selectivity for several of the 5 cloned sstr subtypes. These conclusions, however, are based on binding comparisons of sstr subtypes from different species expressed in different cell lines and studied with different radioligands. To eliminate the effect of species and/or methodological variations, we have investigated agonist selectivity of 32 synthetic SST analogs for all 5 hsstrs stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells under identical binding conditions. We show that hsstr2, 3, 5 react potently with hexapeptide as well as cyclic and linear octapeptide analogs and belong to a similar sstr subclass. hsstr1 and 4 react poorly with these analogs and belong to a separate subclass. The present generation of SST analogs exhibit a modest-50 fold increase in binding potency compared to SST-14 for 2 subtypes (hsstr2, 3), and relative selectivity for only 1 subtype (hsstr2) which is at best only 35 fold. The potency and degree of selectivity of these analogs is several orders of magnitude less than that reported earlier and suggests the need for caution in using these compounds as putative superagonists or subtype selective compounds for any of the individual sstrs.",,
15333679,Superagonism at the human somatostatin receptor subtype 4.,"We have discovered a novel compound, J-2156 [(1'S, 2S)-4-amino-N-(1'-carbamoyl-2'-phenylethyl)-2-(4''-methyl-1''-naphthalenesulfonylamino)butanamide], that belongs to a new class of somatostatin receptor ligands. J-2156 binds with nanomolar affinity to the human somatostatin receptor subtype 4 and is over 400-fold subtype-selective against the other somatostatin receptors. When evaluated in a [(35)S]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio) triphosphate binding assay, J-2156 elicited a response 2 to 3 times as large as that of somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14. That somatostatin-14 is clearly not a maximally efficacious agonist could be verified by demonstrating that it displays the typical behavior of a partial agonist when tested against J-2156. Increasing concentrations of somatostatin-14 cause a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the dose-response curves for J-2156, without affecting its maximal response. This lack of reduction of the maximal response and the fact that the superior efficacy of J-2156 is detected in membranes argue against desensitization and internalization as possible explanations for the superior efficacy of J-2156. More likely is that somatostatin-14 and J-2156 stabilize distinct receptor conformations that differ in their ability to interact with G-proteins. In a cyclic AMP assay, J-2156, somatostatin-28, and somatostatin-14 all act as full agonists. However, this outcome is most likely due to the presence of a receptor reserve in the cyclic AMP assay since there is a large gain of apparent potency in the cyclic AMP assay and the gain is larger for J-2156 than for somatostatin. We conclude that the endogenous ligands somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 do not define maximal agonism on the human somatostatin receptor subtype 4 and that J-2156 represents a so-called superagonist.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2005
15664000,Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) confirms that MEPE binds to PHEX via the MEPE-ASARM motif: a model for impaired mineralization in X-linked rickets (HYP).,"Matrix Extracellular Phospho-glycoprotEin (MEPE) and proteases are elevated and PHEX is defective in HYP. PHEX prevents proteolysis of MEPE and release of a protease-resistant MEPE-ASARM peptide, an inhibitor of mineralization (minhibin). Thus, in HYP, mutated PHEX may contribute to increased ASARM peptide release. Moreover, binding of MEPE by PHEX may regulate this process in normal subjects. The nature of the PHEX-MEPE nonproteolytic interaction(s) (direct or indirect) is/are unknown. Our aims were to determine (1) whether PHEX binds specifically to MEPE, (2) whether the binding involves the ASARM motif region, and (3) whether free ASARM peptide affects mineralization in vivo in mice. Protein interactions between MEPE and recombinant soluble PHEX (secPHEX) were measured using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Briefly, secPHEX, MEPE, and control protein (IgG) were immobilized on a Biacore CM5 sensor chip, and SPR experiments were performed on a Biacore 3000 high-performance research system. Pure secPHEX was then injected at different concentrations, and interactions with immobilized proteins were measured. To determine MEPE sequences interacting with secPHEX, the inhibitory effects of MEPE-ASARM peptides (phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated), control peptides, and MEPE midregion RGD peptides on secPHEX binding to chip-immobilized MEPE were measured. ASARM peptide and etidronate-mediated mineralization inhibition in vivo and in vitro were determined by quenched calcein fluorescence in hind limbs and calvariae in mice and by histological Sanderson stain. A specific, dose-dependent and Zn-dependent protein interaction between secPHEX and immobilized MEPE occurs (EC50 of 553 nM). Synthetic MEPE PO4-ASARM peptide inhibits the PHEX-MEPE interaction (K(D(app)) = 15 uM and B(max/inhib) = 68%). In contrast, control and MEPE-RGD peptides had no effect. Subcutaneous administration of ASARM peptide resulted in marked quenching of fluorescence in calvariae and hind limbs relative to vehicle controls indicating impaired mineralization. Similar results were obtained with etidronate. Sanderson-stained calvariae also indicated a marked increase in unmineralized osteoid with ASARM peptide and etidronate groups. We conclude that PHEX and MEPE form a nonproteolytic protein interaction via the MEPE carboxy-terminal ASARM motif, and the ASARM peptide inhibits mineralization in vivo. The binding of MEPE and ASARM peptide by PHEX may explain why loss of functional osteoblast-expressed PHEX results in defective mineralization in HYP.",,
11724772,Surfactant protein A inhibits peptidoglycan-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion in U937 cells and alveolar macrophages by direct interaction with toll-like receptor 2.,"Pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) plays an important role in modulation of the innate immune system of the lung. Peptidoglycan (PGN), a cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, is known to elicit excessive proinflammatory cytokine production from immune cells. In this study we investigated whether SP-A interacts with PGN and alters PGN-elicited cellular responses. Binding studies demonstrate that PGN is not a ligand for SP-A. However, SP-A significantly reduced PGN-elicited tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion by U937 cells and rat alveolar macrophages. The inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha secretion was dependent upon SP-A concentrations in physiological range. Coincubation of SP-A and PGN with human embryonic kidney 293 cells that had been transiently transfected with the cDNA of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), a cell signaling receptor for PGN, significantly attenuated PGN-induced nuclear factor-kappaB activity. SP-A directly bound to a soluble form of the recombinant extracellular TLR2 domain (sTLR2). Coincubation of sTLR2 with SP-A significantly reduced the binding of sTLR2 to PGN. These results indicate that the direct interaction of SP-A with TLR2 alters PGN-induced cell signaling. We propose that SP-A modulates inflammatory responses against the bacterial components by interactions with pattern-recognition receptors.",,
22511785,"Surfactant protein D (Sp-D) binds to membrane-proximal domain (D3) of signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα), a site distant from binding domain of CD47, while also binding to analogous region on signal regulatory protein β (SIRPβ).","Signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα), a highly glycosylated type-1 transmembrane protein, is composed of three immunoglobulin-like extracellular loops as well as a cytoplasmic tail containing three classical tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. Previous reports indicate that SIRPα binds to humoral pattern recognition molecules in the collectin family, namely surfactant proteins D and A (Sp-D and Sp-A, respectively), which are heavily expressed in the lung and constitute one of the first lines of innate immune defense against pathogens. However, little is known about molecular details of the structural interaction of Sp-D with SIRPs. In the present work, we examined the molecular basis of Sp-D binding to SIRPα using domain-deleted mutant proteins. We report that Sp-D binds to the membrane-proximal Ig domain (D3) of SIRPα in a calcium- and carbohydrate-dependent manner. Mutation of predicted N-glycosylation sites on SIRPα indicates that Sp-D binding is dependent on interactions with specific N-glycosylated residues on the membrane-proximal D3 domain of SIRPα. Given the remarkable sequence similarity of SIRPα to SIRPβ and the lack of known ligands for the latter, we examined Sp-D binding to SIRPβ. Here, we report specific binding of Sp-D to the membrane-proximal D3 domain of SIRPβ. Further studies confirmed that Sp-D binds to SIRPα expressed on human neutrophils and differentiated neutrophil-like cells. Because the other known ligand of SIRPα, CD47, binds to the membrane-distal domain D1, these findings indicate that multiple, distinct, functional ligand binding sites are present on SIRPα that may afford differential regulation of receptor function.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2012
30605400,Sustained Klotho delivery reduces serum phosphate in a model of diabetic nephropathy.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a primary cause of end-stage renal disease and is becoming more prevalent because of the global rise in type 2 diabetes. A model of DN, the db/db uninephrectomized ( db/db-uni) mouse, is characterized by obesity, as well as compromised renal function. This model also manifests defects in mineral metabolism common in DN, including hyperphosphatemia, which leads to severe endocrine disease. The FGF23 coreceptor, α-Klotho, circulates as a soluble, cleaved form (cKL) and may directly influence phosphate handling. Our study sought to test the effects of cKL on mineral metabolism in db/db-uni mice. Mice were placed into either mild or moderate disease groups on the basis of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Body weights of db/db-uni mice were significantly greater across the study compared with lean controls regardless of disease severity. Adeno-associated cKL administration was associated with increased serum Klotho, intact, bioactive FGF23 (iFGF23), and COOH-terminal fragments of FGF23 ( P < 0.05). Blood urea nitrogen was improved after cKL administration, and cKL corrected hyperphosphatemia in the high- and low-ACR db/db-uni groups. Interestingly, 2 wk after cKL delivery, blood glucose levels were significantly reduced in db/db-uni mice with high ACR ( P < 0.05). Interestingly, several genes associated with stabilizing active iFGF23 were also increased in the osteoblastic UMR-106 cell line with cKL treatment. In summary, delivery of cKL to a model of DN normalized blood phosphate levels regardless of disease severity, supporting the concept that targeting cKL-affected pathways could provide future therapeutic avenues in DN. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this work, systemic and continuous delivery of the ""soluble"" or ""cleaved"" form of the FGF23 coreceptor α-Klotho (cKL) via adeno-associated virus to a rodent model of diabetic nephropathy (DN), the db/db uninephrectomized mouse, normalized blood phosphate levels regardless of disease severity. This work supports the concept that targeting cKL-affected pathways could provide future therapeutic avenues for the severe mineral metabolism defects associated with DN.",,
12006486,Synaptic multiprotein complexes associated with 5-HT(2C) receptors: a proteomic approach.,"Membrane-bound receptors such as tyrosine kinases and ionotropic receptors are associated with large protein networks structured by protein-protein interactions involving multidomain proteins. Although these networks have emerged as a general mechanism of cellular signalling, much less is known about the protein complexes associated with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Using a proteomic approach based on peptide affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting, we have identified 15 proteins that interact with the C- terminal tail of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C (5-HT(2C)) receptor, a GPCR. These proteins include several synaptic multidomain proteins containing one or several PDZ domains (PSD95 and the proteins of the tripartite complex Veli3-CASK-Mint1), proteins of the actin/spectrin cytoskeleton and signalling proteins. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that 5-HT(2C) receptors interact with PSD95 and the Veli3-CASK-Mint1 complex in vivo. Electron microscopy also indicated a synaptic enrichment of Veli3 and 5-HT(2C) receptors and their colocalization in microvilli of choroidal cells. These results indicate that the 5-HT(2C) receptor is associated with protein networks that are important for its synaptic localization and its coupling to the signalling machinery.",The EMBO journal,2002
21813734,Syndecan-2 is a novel ligand for the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor CD148.,"Syndecan-2 is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that has a cell adhesion regulatory domain contained within its extracellular core protein. Cell adhesion to the syndecan-2 extracellular domain (S2ED) is β1 integrin dependent; however, syndecan-2 is not an integrin ligand. Here the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor CD148 is shown to be a key intermediary in cell adhesion to S2ED, with downstream β1 integrin-mediated adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. We show that S2ED is a novel ligand for CD148 and identify the region proximal to the transmembrane domain of syndecan-2 as the site of interaction with CD148. A mechanism for the transduction of the signal from CD148 to β1 integrins is elucidated requiring Src kinase and potential implication of the C2β isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase. Our data uncover a novel pathway for β1 integrin-mediated adhesion of importance in cellular processes such as angiogenesis and inflammation.",,
10734053,Syndecan-2 is involved in the mitogenic activity and signaling of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in osteoblasts.,"We previously showed that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed at the surface of osteoblastic cells and that the mitogenic activity of this cytokine is dependent on the presence of fully sulfated proteoglycans. In this study, we determined if GM-CSF interacts with syndecans, a family of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Human primary osteoblasts were found to express syndecan-2 and -4 but few syndecan-1 transcripts and proteins. Recombinant human GM-CSF coupled to biotin was found to bind to syndecan-2. Immunocytochemical transmission electron microscope analysis showed co-localization of syndecan-2 and GM-CSF at the cell membrane surface. Syndecan-2 also co-localized at the cell surface and co-immunoprecipitated with the GM-CSF receptor alpha chain, suggesting a strong interaction between the cytokine, its receptor, and syndecan-2. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in syndecan-2 associated with the alpha chain of the GM-CSF receptor was increased after cell stimulation by GM-CSF. Antisense oligonucleotides that reduced specifically the expression of syndecan-2 inhibited the mitogenic activity of GM-CSF and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 induced by the cytokine. Our results indicate functional interactions between syndecan-2 and GM-CSF in osteoblasts, and we propose that syndecan-2 plays a role as a co-receptor for this cytokine.",,
14976204,Syndecan-2 regulates transforming growth factor-beta signaling.,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has multiple functions including increasing extracellular matrix deposition in fibrosis. It functions through a complex family of cell surface receptors that mediate downstream signaling. We report here that a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, syndecan-2 (S2), can regulate TGF-beta signaling. S2 protein increased in the renal interstitium in diabetes and regulated TGF-beta-mediated increased matrix deposition in vitro. Transfection of renal papillary fibroblasts with S2 or a S2 construct that has a truncated cytoplasmic domain (S2DeltaS) promoted TGF-beta binding and S2 core protein ectodomain directly bound TGF-beta. Transfection with S2 increased the amounts of type I and type II TGF-beta receptors (TbetaRI and TbetaRII), whereas S2DeltaS was much less effective. In contrast, S2DeltaS dramatically increased the level of type III TGF-beta receptor (TbetaRIII), betaglycan, whereas S2 resulted in a decrease. Syndecan-2 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with betaglycan but not with TbetaRI or TbetaRII. This is a novel mechanism of control of TGF-beta action that may be important in fibrosis.",,
17879962,Syndecan-4 contributes to endothelial tubulogenesis through interactions with two motifs inside the pro-angiogenic N-terminal domain of thrombospondin-1.,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an extracellular matrix protein that modulates focal adhesion in mammalian cells and exhibits dual roles in angiogenesis. In a previous work, we showed that a recombinant 18 kDa protein encompassing the N-terminal residues 1-174 of human TSP-1 (TSP18) induced tubulogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and protected them from apoptosis. Our results indicated that these effects were possibly mediated by syndecan-4 proteoglycan, since binding of TSP18 to endothelial extracts was inhibited by anti-syndecan-4 antibody. Syndecan-4 is a heparan-sulfate proteoglycan that regulates cell-matrix interactions and is the only member of its family present in focal adhesions. In this report, we demonstrate that a monoclonal antibody against syndecan-4 blocks TSP18-induced tubulogenesis. Furthermore, through 2D adhesion and 3D angiogenic assays, we demonstrate that two sequences, TSP Hep I and II, retain the major pro-angiogenic activity of TSP18. These TSP-1 motifs also compete with the fibronectin Hep II domain for binding to syndecan-4 on endothelial cell surface, indicating that they may exert their effects by interfering with the recognition of fibronectin by syndecan-4. Additionally, TSP18 and its derived peptides activate the PKC-dependent Akt-PKB signaling pathway. Blockage of PKC activation prevented HUVEC spreading when seeded on TSP18 fragment, and on TSP Hep I and TSP Hep II peptides, but not on gelatin-coated substrates. Our results identify syndecan-4 as a novel receptor for the N-terminus of TSP-1 and suggest that TSP-1 N-terminal pro-angiogenic activity is linked to its capacity of interfering with syndecan-4 functions in the course of cell adhesion.",,
9012653,Syndecan-4 is a primary-response gene induced by basic fibroblast growth factor and arterial injury in vascular smooth muscle cells.,"Syndecans are a family of transmembrane proteoglycans that have been implicated in cell-extracellular matrix adhesion and growth factor binding. We reported previously that syndecan-1 expression by cultured rate vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is induced by serum- or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). We now report that syndecan-4 mRNA is rapidly induced in cultured VSMCs in response to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or serum stimulation. In the presence of cycloheximide, induction of syndecan-4 mRNA was enhanced. These characteristics identified syndecan-4 as a primary-response gene product in VSMCs. In contrast, syndecan-1 mRNA expression in response to serum was completely blocked in the presence of cycloheximide. We also examined the expression of syndecan mRNAs in VSMCs in response to balloon catheter injury in vivo. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique was developed that enabled us to amplify all four syndecan mRNAs in a single reaction tube and determine relative changes in their expression. All four syndecan mRNAs were detected in uninjured rat carotid arteries. In endothelium-denuded arteries, the medial layer (presumably VSMCs) accounted for 70% to 90% of the syndecan mRNAs in the vessel wall. The levels of syndecan-2 and syndecan-3 mRNAs were not altered significantly after balloon injury. In contrast, syndecan-4 mRNA was increased at early times after injury but then decreased to control level by 7 days. Syndecan-1 mRNA levels showed a slower but prolonged increase that reached a maximum at 7 days after injury. Immunostaining with anti-syndecan-4 antibodies demonstrated a rapid increase in syndecan-4 proteoglycan expression in the injured carotid artery.",,
9767422,Synergistic augmentative effect of interleukin-10 and CD27/CD70 interactions on B-cell immunoglobulin synthesis.,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a potent cytokine that regulates immunoglobulin synthesis by B cells. CD27/CD70 interactions by direct cell-to-cell contact are also needed to produce substantial amounts of immunoglobulin. We have investigated the effects of IL-10 and CD27/CD70 interactions on the immunoglobulin synthesis. In the presence of IL-10 stimulation, the production of IgG, IgM and IgA was increased synergistically by the addition of CD27 ligand (CD70)-transfectants in a dose-dependent manner, which was completely blocked by anti-CD70 monoclonal antibody. In contrast, CD70-transfectants additively enhanced the immunoglobulin production in the presence of IL-2, IL-4, or IL-6. The synergistic enhancement of the immunoglobulin production by IL-10 and CD70-transfectants was remarkable in highly purified CD27+ B cells, but there was no immunoglobulin production in CD27- B cells. Furthermore, by the addition of CD70-transfectants, the synthesis of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 was also enhanced in the presence of IL-10. On the other hand, IL-10 diminished CD27 expression in B cells. B-cell proliferation was augmented by CD70-transfectants with IL-10 or IL-10 plus IL-2. The addition of IL-2 further augmented the immunoglobulin production which was synergistically enhanced by IL-10 and CD27 triggering. Taken together, the co-operative response to IL-10 and CD27/CD70 interactions regulates B-cell immunoglobulin production.",,
11282024,Synergistic effects of different bone morphogenetic protein type I receptors on alkaline phosphatase induction.,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, which regulate the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. Here we show that among members of the BMP family, BMP-4 and growth/differentiation factor 5 (GDF-5) induce osteoblast differentiation through the activation of three receptor-regulated Smads (i.e. Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8). By contrast, BMP-6 and BMP-7 induce alkaline phosphatase activity through Smad1 and Smad5, but not through Smad8. Consistent with these findings, BMP-4 induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8, but BMP-6 activated only Smad1 and Smad5. BMP-4 and GDF-5 are known to bind to activin receptor-like kinase 3 (ALK-3) and/or ALK-6 (also termed BMP type IA and type IB receptors, respectively), whereas BMP-6 and BMP-7 preferentially bind to ALK-2. Compared with the effects induced by only one of the type I receptors, the combination of constitutively active forms of ALK-2 and ALK-3 (or ALK-6) more strongly induced alkaline phosphatase activity in C2C12 cells. Moreover, addition of BMP-4 and BMP-6 to C2C12 cells resulted in higher alkaline phosphatase activity than that of only one of these BMPs. The combination of ALK-2 and ALK-3 also induced higher transcriptional activity than either receptor alone. Thus, ALK-2 and ALK-3 (or ALK-6) might synergistically induce osteoblast differentiation of C2C12 cells, possibly through efficient activation of downstream signaling pathways.",Journal of cell science,2001
9724791,Synthesis and biological activities of potent peptidomimetics selective for somatostatin receptor subtype 2.,"A series of nonpeptide somatostatin agonists which bind selectively and with high affinity to somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2) have been synthesized. One of these compounds, L-054,522, binds to human sst2 with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.01 nM and at least 3,000-fold selectivity when evaluated against the other somatostatin receptors. L-054,522 is a full agonist based on its inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells stably expressing sst2. L-054,522 has a potent inhibitory effect on growth hormone release from rat primary pituitary cells and glucagon release from isolated mouse pancreatic islets. Intravenous infusion of L-054,522 to rats at 50 microgram/kg per hr causes a rapid and sustained reduction in growth hormone to basal levels. The high potency and selectivity of L-054, 522 for sst2 will make it a useful tool to further characterize the physiological functions of this receptor subtype.",,
11839762,"Synthesis and biological evaluation in vitro of a selective, high potency peptide agonist of human melanin-concentrating hormone action at human melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1.","Human melanin-concentrating hormone (hMCH) is a nonselective natural ligand for the human melanin-concentrating hormone receptors: hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R. Similarly, the smaller peptide encompassing the disulfide ring and Arg(6) of hMCH, Ac-Arg(6)-cyclo(S-S)(Cys(7)-Met(8)-Leu(9)-Gly(10)-Arg(11)-Val(12)-Tyr(13)-Arg(14)-Pro(15)-Cys(16))-NH(2), Ac-hMCH(6-16)-NH(2), binds to and activates equally well both human MCH receptors present in the brain. To separate the physiological functions of hMCH-1R from those of hMCH-2R, new potent and hMCH-1R selective agonists are necessary. In the present study, analogs of Ac-hMCH(6-16)-NH(2) were prepared and tested in binding and functional assays on cells expressing the MCH receptors. In these peptides, Arg in position 6 was replaced with various d-amino acids and/or Gly in position 10 was substituted with various L-amino acids. Several of the new compounds turned out to be potent agonists at hMCH-1R with improved selectivity over hMCH-2R. For example, peptide 26 with d-Arg in place of L-Arg in position 6 and Asn in place of Gly in position 10, Ac-dArg(6)-cyclo(S-S)(Cys(7)-Met(8)-Leu(9)-Asn(10)-Arg(11)-Val(12)-Tyr(13)-Arg(14)-Pro(15)-Cys(16))-NH(2), was a potent hMCH-1R agonist (IC(50) = 0.5 nm, EC(50) = 47 nm) with more than 200-fold selectivity with respect to hMCH-2R. Apparently, these structural changes in positions 6 and 10 results in peptide conformations that allow for efficient interactions with hMCH-1R but are unfavorable for molecular recognition at hMCH-2R.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002

Compared to the unsubstituted parent compound SB 223 412 (Ki=27 nM +/- 9), affinity was not altered for the analogues 1c and 2c bearing a fluorine in position 8 (Ki approximately 24-27 nM), and was only slightly reduced for compounds 1b, 2b, 1e and 2e fluorinated or iodinated at the position 7 (Ki approximately 49-67 nM). A drastic reduction in binding (Ki > 115 nM) was observed for all other halogenated compounds 1a, 2a, 1d, 2d, 1f and 2f.",,
11170631,Synthesis and characterization of fluorescent and photoactivatable MIP-1alpha ligands and interactions with chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5.,"Photoaffinity and fluorescent analogues of the 70-amino acid chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) were designed, synthesized, characterized, and applied to probe MIP-1alpha interactions with the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5. The photoactivatable MIP-1alpha ligand, BP-MIP-1alpha, and the fluorescent ligand, Flu-MIP-1alpha were prepared by selective chemical coupling of p-benzoylphenylthiocarbamyl or fluoresceinthiocarbamyl, respectively, at the N-terminus of MIP-1alpha. Both ligands BP-MIP-1alpha and Flu-MIP-1alpha retained high binding affinity and agonist potency at CCR1 and CCR5. Photoaffinity labeling of CCR1 and CCR5 receptors stably expressed in CHO cells resulted in specific covalent attachment of [(125)I]BP-MIP-1alpha and production of protein complexes of 54 and 48 kDa, respectively, on SDS-PAGE. This represents the first photo-cross-linking between a chemokine and its receptor. Flu-MIP-1alpha selectively labeled CCR1 or CCR5 receptors expressed in CHO cells and was used to characterize receptor binding domains. When bound to CCR1 or CCR5 receptors, the fluorescence signal of Flu-MIP-1alpha was quenched by collision with iodide indicating that the N-terminal end of MIP-1alpha is accessible to the solvent. These data strongly suggest that the N-terminal end of MIP-1alpha interacts with domains of CCR1 or CCR5 receptors located at the extracellular surface. The photoactivatable BP-MIP-1alpha described here should prove valuable for the identification of contact sites on receptors by photoaffinity labeling experiments.",,
1967312,Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of dynorphin A-(1-8) amide analogues.,"In order to study the structure-activity relationships of dynorphin A-(1-8) amide [Dyn(1-8)-NH2], 20 analogues were synthesized by the solution method. Their biological activities were determined in the three bioassays [guinea pig ileum (GPI), mouse vas deferens (MVD), and rabbit vas deferens (RVD)] and in the mouse tail-pinch test after intravenous administration. Some analogues that showed interesting activity in the bioassays and/or in the analgesic tests were further characterized in mu-, delta-, and kappa-representative binding assays. The obtained data indicate that modification of the enkephalin segment to give metabolically stable analogues with high affinity and selectivity for the kappa receptor is strictly limited and that introduction of MeArg in position 7 protects the Arg6-Arg-7 bond from enzymatic degradation without potency drop and change of opioid receptor selectivity. [MeTyr1,MeArg7,D-Leu8]Dyn(1-8)-NHEt (18) [IC50 (nM) = 0.3 (GPI), 7.4 (MVD), and 2.6 (RVD); tail pinch ED50 (mg/kg) = 0.75] showed opioid activity similar to that of dynorphin A in the three bioassays and relatively high kappa-receptor selectivity in the binding assays and produced a 2.5-fold more potent analgesic effect than morphine. [D-Cys2-Cys5,MeArg7,D-Leu8]Dyn(1-8)-NHEt (20) showed a 40-60-fold more potent opioid activity than 18 in the three bioassays and produced a 3.4-fold more potent analgesic effect than 18. In the binding assays, however, 20 showed higher affinity for mu and delta receptors than for the kappa receptor.",,
12434297,T cell adhesion and cytolysis of pancreatic cancer cells: a role for E-cadherin in immunotherapy?,"Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive and potent disease, which is largely resistant to conventional forms of treatment. However, the discovery of antigens associated with pancreatic cancer cells has recently suggested the possibility that immunotherapy might become a specific and effective therapeutic option. T cells within many epithelia, including those of the pancreas, are known to express the alphaEbeta7-integrin adhesion molecule, CD103. The only characterised ligand for CD103 is E-cadherin, an epithelial adhesion molecule which exhibits reduced expression in pancreatic cancer. In our study, CD103 was found to be expressed only by activated T cells following exposure to tumour necrosis factor beta 1, a factor produced by many cancer cells. Significantly, the expression of this integrin was restricted mainly to class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD8+ T cells. The human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 was transfected with human E-cadherin in order to generate E-cadherin negative (wild type) and positive (transfected) sub-lines. Using a sensitive flow cytometric adhesion assay it was found that the expression of both CD103 (on T cells) and E-cadherin (on cancer cells) was essential for efficient adhesion of activated T cells to pancreatic cancer cells. This adhesion process was inhibited by the addition of antibodies specific for CD103, thereby demonstrating the importance of the CD103-->E-cadherin interaction for T-cell adhesion. Using a 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assay it was found that CD103 expressing T cells lysed E-cadherin expressing Panc-1 target cells following T cell receptor stimulation; addition of antibodies specific for CD103 significantly reduced this lysis. Furthermore, absence of either CD103 from the T cells or E-cadherin expression from the cancer cells resulted in a significant reduction in cancer cell lysis. Therefore, potentially antigenic pancreatic cancer cells could evade a local anti-cancer immune response in vivo as a consequence of their loss of E-cadherin expression; this phenotypic change may also favour metastasis by reducing homotypic adhesion between adjacent cancer cells. We conclude that effective immunotherapy is likely to require upregulation of E-cadherin expression by pancreatic cancer cells or the development of cytotoxic immune cells that are less dependent on this adhesion molecule for efficient effecter function.",,
23685786,T cell regulation mediated by interaction of soluble CD52 with the inhibitory receptor Siglec-10.,"Functionally diverse T cell populations interact to maintain homeostasis of the immune system. We found that human and mouse antigen-activated T cells with high expression of the lymphocyte surface marker CD52 suppressed other T cells. CD52(hi)CD4(+) T cells were distinct from CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. Their suppression was mediated by soluble CD52 released by phospholipase C. Soluble CD52 bound to the inhibitory receptor Siglec-10 and impaired phosphorylation of the T cell receptor-associated kinases Lck and Zap70 and T cell activation. Humans with type 1 diabetes had a lower frequency and diminished function of CD52(hi)CD4(+) T cells responsive to the autoantigen GAD65. In diabetes-prone mice of the nonobese diabetic (NOD) strain, transfer of lymphocyte populations depleted of CD52(hi) cells resulted in a substantially accelerated onset of diabetes. Our studies identify a ligand-receptor mechanism of T cell regulation that may protect humans and mice from autoimmune disease.",Nature immunology,2013
8925404,Tachykinins: receptor to effector.,"Tachykinins belong to an evolutionarily conserved family of peptide neurotransmitters. The mammalian tachykinins include substance P, neurokinin A and neurokinin B, which exert their effects by binding to specific receptors. These tachykinin receptors are divided into three types, designated NK1, NK2 and NK3, respectively. Tachykinin receptors have been cloned and contain seven segments spanning the cell membrane, indicating their inclusion in the G-protein-linked receptor family. The continued development of selective agonists and antagonists for each receptor has helped elucidate roles for these mediators, ranging from effects in the central nervous system to the perpetuation of the inflammatory response in the periphery. Various selective ligands have shown both inter- and intraspecies differences in binding potencies, indicating distinct binding sites in the tachykinin receptor. The interaction of tachykinin with its receptor activates Gq, which in turn activates phospholipase C to break down phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 acts on specific receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release intracellular stores of Ca2+, while DAG acts via protein kinase C to open L-type calcium channels in the plasma membrane. The rise in intracellular [Ca2+] induces the tissue response. With an array of actions as diverse as that seen with tachykinins, there is scope for numerous therapeutic possibilities. With the development of potent, selective non-peptide antagonists, there could be potential benefits in the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions, including chronic pain, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, rheumatoid arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome and asthma.",,
10801128,TACI and BCMA are receptors for a TNF homologue implicated in B-cell autoimmune disease.,"B cells are important in the development of autoimmune disorders by mechanisms involving dysregulated polyclonal B-cell activation, production of pathogenic antibodies, and co-stimulation of autoreactive T cells. zTNF4 (BLyS, BAFF, TALL-1, THANK) is a member of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family that is a potent co-activator of B cells in vitro and in vivo. Here we identify two receptors for zTNF4 and demonstrate a relationship between zTNF4 and autoimmune disease. Transgenic animals overexpressing zTNF4 in lymphoid cells develop symptoms characteristic of systemic lupus erythaematosus (SLE) and expand a rare population of splenic B-Ia lymphocytes. In addition, circulating zTNF4 is more abundant in NZBWF1 and MRL-lpr/lpr mice during the onset and progression of SLE. We have identified two TNF receptor family members, TACI and BCMA, that bind zTNF4. Treatment of NZBWF1 mice with soluble TACI-Ig fusion protein inhibits the development of proteinuria and prolongs survival of the animals. These findings demonstrate the involvement of zTNF4 and its receptors in the development of SLE and identify TACI-Ig as a promising treatment of autoimmune disease in humans.",Nature,2000
8663147,"TAFI, or plasma procarboxypeptidase B, couples the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades through the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex.","TAFI (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor) is a recently discovered plasma protein that can be activated by thrombin-catalyzed proteolysis to a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme that inhibits fibrinolysis. This work shows that the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, rather than free thrombin, is the most likely physiologic activator. Thrombomodulin increases the catalytic efficiency of the reaction by a factor of 1250, an effect expressed almost exclusively through an increase in kcat. The kinetics of the reaction conform to a model whereby thrombin can interact with either TAFI (Km = 1.0 microM) or thrombomodulin (Kd = 8.6 nM), and either binary complex so formed can then interact with the third component to form the ternary thrombin-thrombomodulin-TAFI complex from which activated TAFI is produced with kcat = 1.2 s-1. This work also shows that activated TAFI down-regulates tPA-induced fibrinolysis half-maximally at a concentration of 1.0 nM in a system of purified components. This concentration of TAFI is about 2% of the level of the zymogen in plasma, which indicates that ample activated TAFI could be generated to very significantly modulate fibrinolysis in vivo. Therefore, TAFI in vitro and possibly in vivo defines an explicit molecular connection between the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades, such that expression of activity in the former down-regulates the activity of the latter.",,

Nectins have both homophilic and heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activities and organize adherens junctions in cooperation with cadherins. We examined here whether Tage4, which was originally identified to be a gene overexpressed in colon carcinoma and has a domain structure similar to those of nectins, is involved in cell adhesion and/or migration. Tage4 heterophilically trans-interacted with nectin-3, but not homophilically with Tage4. Expression of Tage4 was markedly elevated in NIH3T3 cells transformed by an oncogenic Ki-Ras (V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells) as compared with that of wild-type NIH3T3 cells. trans-Interaction of Tage4 with nectin-3 enhanced motility of V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells. Tage4 did not bind afadin, a nectin- and actin filament-binding protein that connects nectins to the actin cytoskeleton and cadherins through catenins. Thus, Tage4 heterophilically trans-interacts with nectin-3 and regulates cell migration. Tage4 is tentatively re-named here nectin-like molecule-5 (necl-5) on the basis of its function and domain structure similar to those of nectins.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2003
15694322,"TAJ/TROY, an orphan TNF receptor family member, binds Nogo-66 receptor 1 and regulates axonal regeneration.","Myelin-associated inhibitory factors (MAIFs) are inhibitors of CNS axonal regeneration following injury. The Nogo receptor complex, composed of the Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1), neurotrophin p75 receptor (p75), and LINGO-1, represses axon regeneration upon binding to these myelin components. The limited expression of p75 to certain types of neurons and its temporal expression during development prompted speculation that other receptors are involved in the NgR1 complex. Here, we show that an orphan receptor in the TNF family called TAJ, broadly expressed in postnatal and adult neurons, binds to NgR1 and can replace p75 in the p75/NgR1/LINGO-1 complex to activate RhoA in the presence of myelin inhibitors. In vitro exogenously added TAJ reversed neurite outgrowth caused by MAIFs. Neurons from Taj-deficient mice were more resistant to the suppressive action of the myelin inhibitors. Given the limited expression of p75, the discovery of TAJ function is an important step for understanding the regulation of axonal regeneration.",Neuron,2005
24163244,Targeted manipulation of the sortilin-progranulin axis rescues progranulin haploinsufficiency.,"Progranulin (GRN) mutations causing haploinsufficiency are a major cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). Recent discoveries demonstrating sortilin (SORT1) is a neuronal receptor for PGRN endocytosis and a determinant of plasma PGRN levels portend the development of enhancers targeting the SORT1-PGRN axis. We demonstrate the preclinical efficacy of several approaches through which impairing PGRN's interaction with SORT1 restores extracellular PGRN levels. Our report is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of enhancing PGRN levels in iPSC neurons derived from frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients with PGRN deficiency. We validate a small molecule preferentially increases extracellular PGRN by reducing SORT1 levels in various mammalian cell lines and patient-derived iPSC neurons and lymphocytes. We further demonstrate that SORT1 antagonists and a small-molecule binder of PGRN₅₈₈₋₅₉₃, residues critical for PGRN-SORT1 binding, inhibit SORT1-mediated PGRN endocytosis. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the SORT1-PGRN axis is a viable target for PGRN-based therapy, particularly in FTD-GRN patients.",Human molecular genetics,2014

10498628,"TECK, an efficacious chemoattractant for human thymocytes, uses GPR-9-6/CCR9 as a specific receptor.","Chemokines regulate leukocytes trafficking in normal and inflammation conditions. Thymus-seeding progenitors are made in bone marrow and migrate to the thymus where they undergo their maturation to antigen-specific T cells. Immature T cells are in thymic cortex, while mature thymocytes are in medulla. Chemokines may be important for homing of thymus-seeding progenitors, and/or differential thymocyte localization in thymus. Here we report that GPR-9-6, now called CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), is a receptor for thymus-expressed chemokine, TECK. Among a panel of chemokines tested, TECK specifically induced calcium flux in CCR9-expressing cell lines. We also showed that TECK efficaciously induced chemotaxis of immature CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive, and mature CD4(+) and CD8(+) single-positive human thymocytes.

10751172,Temporal and spatial gradients of Fgf8 and Fgf17 regulate proliferation and differentiation of midline cerebellar structures.,"The midbrain-hindbrain (MHB) junction has the properties of an organizer that patterns the MHB region early in vertebrate development. Fgf8 is thought to mediate this organizer function. In addition to Fgf8, Fgf17 and Fgf18 are also expressed in the MHB junction. Fgf17 is expressed later and broader than either Fgf8 or Fgf18. Disrupting the Fgf17 gene in the mouse decreased precursor cell proliferation in the medial cerebellar (vermis) anlage after E11.5. Loss of an additional copy of Fgf8 enhanced the phenotype and accelerated its onset, demonstrating that both molecules cooperate to regulate the size of the precursor pool of cells that develop into the cerebellar vermis. However, expression patterns of Wnt1, En2, Pax5 and Otx2 were not altered suggesting that specification and patterning of MHB tissue was not perturbed and that these FGFs are not required to pattern the vermis at this stage of development. The consequence of this developmental defect is a progressive, dose-dependent loss of the most anterior lobe of the vermis in mice lacking Fgf17 and in mice lacking Fgf17 and one copy of Fgf8. Significantly, the differentiation of anterior vermis neuroepithelium was shifted rostrally and medially demonstrating that FGF also regulates the polarized progression of differentiation in the vermis anlage. Finally, this developmental defect results in an ataxic gait in some mice.","Development (Cambridge, England)",2000
10966654,Ternary complex between placental lactogen and the extracellular domain of the prolactin receptor.,"The structure of the ternary complex between ovine placental lactogen (oPL) and the extracellular domain (ECD) of the rat prolactin receptor (rPRLR) reveals that two rPRLR ECDs bind to opposite sides of oPL with pseudo two-fold symmetry. The two oPL receptor binding sites differ significantly in their topography and electrostatic character. These binding interfaces also involve different hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic packing patterns compared to the structurally related human growth hormone (hGH)-receptor complexes. Additionally, the receptor-receptor interactions are different from those of the hGH-receptor complex. The conformational adaptability of prolactin and growth hormone receptors is evidenced by the changes in local conformations of the receptor binding loops and more global changes induced by shifts in the angular relationships between the N- and C-terminal domains, which allow the receptor to bind to the two topographically distinct sites of oPL.",,
10190906,Tetrameric complexes of human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G bind to peripheral blood myelomonocytic cells.,"The nonclassical MHC class I molecule human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G is selectively expressed on fetal trophoblast tissue at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnancy. It has long been suggested that HLA-G may inhibit maternal natural killer (NK) cells through interaction with particular NK cell receptors (KIRs). To investigate interactions of HLA-G, we constructed phycoerythrin-labeled tetrameric complexes of HLA-G refolded with a self-peptide. These HLA-G tetramers failed to bind to NK cells and cells transfected with CD94/NKG2 and killer immunoglobulin-like NK receptors. In contrast, HLA-G tetramers did bind to peripheral blood monocytes, staining a CD16(+)CD14(mid) subset with greater intensity. On transfectants, HLA-G tetramers bound to inhibitory immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT)2 and ILT4 receptors. However, staining in the presence of antibodies reactive with ILT receptors revealed that the interaction of HLA-G tetramers with blood monocytes was largely due to binding to ILT4. These results suggest that the primary role of HLA-G may be the modulation of myelomonocytic cell behavior in pregnancy.",,
26849959,TGF-β-induced profibrotic signaling is regulated in part by the WNT receptor Frizzled-8.,"TGF-β is important in lung injury and remodeling processes. TGF-β and Wingless/integrase-1 (WNT) signaling are interconnected; however, the WNT ligand-receptor complexes involved are unknown. Thus, we aimed to identify Frizzled (FZD) receptors that mediate TGF-β-induced profibrotic signaling. MRC-5 and primary human lung fibroblasts were stimulated with TGF-β1, WNT-5A, or WNT-5B in the presence and absence of specific pathway inhibitors. Specific small interfering RNA was used to knock down FZD8. In vivo studies using bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis were performed in wild-type and FZD8-deficient mice. TGF-β1 induced FZD8 specifically via Smad3-dependent signaling in MRC-5 and primary human lung fibroblasts. It is noteworthy that FZD8 knockdown reduced TGF-β1-induced collagen Iα1, fibronectin, versican, α-smooth muscle (sm)-actin, and connective tissue growth factor. Moreover, bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis was attenuated in FZD8-deficient mice in vivo Although inhibition of canonical WNT signaling did not affect TGF-β1-induced gene expression in vitro, noncanonical WNT-5B mimicked TGF-β1-induced fibroblast activation. FZD8 knockdown reduced both WNT-5B-induced gene expression of fibronectin and α-sm-actin, as well as WNT-5B-induced changes in cellular impedance. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a role for FZD8 in TGF-β-induced profibrotic signaling and imply that WNT-5B may be the ligand for FZD8 in these responses.-Spanjer, A. I. R., Baarsma, H.

30692635,TGFβ promotes breast cancer stem cell self-renewal through an ILEI/LIFR signaling axis.,"FAM3C/Interleukin-like EMT Inducer (ILEI) is an oncogenic member of the FAM3 cytokine family and serves essential roles in both epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and breast cancer metastasis. ILEI expression levels are regulated through a non-canonical TGFβ signaling pathway by 3'-UTR-mediated translational silencing at the mRNA level by hnRNP E1. TGFβ stimulation or silencing of hnRNP E1 increases ILEI translation and induces an EMT program that correlates with enhanced invasion and migration. Recently, EMT has been linked to the formation of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) that confer both tumor cell heterogeneity as well as chemoresistant properties. Herein, we demonstrate that hnRNP E1 knockdown significantly shifts normal mammary epithelial cells to mesenchymal BCSCs in vitro and in vivo. We further validate that modulating ILEI protein levels results in the abrogation of these phenotypes, promoting further investigation into the unknown mechanism of ILEI signaling that drives tumor progression. We identify LIFR as the receptor for ILEI, which mediates signaling through STAT3 to drive both EMT and BCSC formation. Reduction of either ILEI or LIFR protein levels results in reduced tumor growth, fewer tumor initiating cells and reduced metastasis within the hnRNP E1 knock-down cell populations in vivo. These results reveal a novel ligand-receptor complex that drives the formation of BCSCs and represents a unique target for the development of metastatic breast cancer therapies.",,
9756851,"The 100-kDa neurotensin receptor is gp95/sortilin, a non-G-protein-coupled receptor.","In this work, the 100-kDa neurotensin (NT) receptor previously purified from human brain by affinity chromatography (Zsürger, N., Mazella, J., and Vincent, J. P. (1994) Brain Res. 639, 245-252) was cloned from a human brain cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a 833-amino acid protein 100% identical to the recently cloned gp95/sortilin and was then designated NT3 receptor-gp95/sortilin. The N terminus of the purified protein is identical to the sequence of the purified gp95/sortilin located immediately after the furin cleavage site. The binding of iodinated NT to 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid-solubilized extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with the cloned cDNA was saturable and reversible with an affinity of 10-15 nM. The localization of the NT3 receptor-gp95/sortilin into intracellular vesicles was in agreement with previous results obtained with the purified receptor and with gp95/sortilin. Affinity labeling and binding experiments showed that the 110-kDa NT3 receptor can be partly transformed into a higher affinity (Kd = 0.3 nM) 100-kDa protein receptor by cotransfection with furin. This 100-kDa NT receptor corresponded to the mature form of the receptor.

In addition to binding LRP, RAP binds two other members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, gp330 and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptors. Here, we show that RAP binds to LDL receptors as well. In normal human foreskin fibroblasts, RAP inhibited LDL receptor-mediated binding and catabolism of LDL and VLDL with Sf 20-60 or 100-400. RAP inhibited 125I-labeled LDL and Sf 100-400 lipoprotein binding at 4 degrees C with KI values of 60 and 45 nM, respectively. The effective concentrations for 50% inhibition (EC50) of cellular degradation of 2.0 nM 125I-labeled LDL, 4.7 nM 125I-labeled Sf 20-60, and 3.6 nM 125I-labeled Sf 100-400 particles were 40, 70, and 51 nM, respectively. Treatment of cells with lovastatin to induce LDL receptors increased cellular binding, internalization, and degradation of RAP by 2.3-, 1.7-, and 2.6-fold, respectively. In solid-phase assays, RAP bound to partially purified LDL receptors in a dose-dependent manner. The dissociation constant (KD) of RAP binding to LDL receptors in the solid-phase assay was 250 nM, which is higher than that for LRP, gp330, or VLDL receptors in similar assays by a factor of 14 to 350. Also, RAP inhibited 125I-labeled LDL and Sf 100-400 VLDL binding to LDL receptors in solid-phase assays with KI values of 140 and 130 nM, respectively. Because LDL bind via apolipoprotein (apo) B100 whereas VLDL bind via apoE, our results show that RAP inhibits LDL receptor interactions with both apoB100 and apoE. These studies establish that RAP is capable of binding to LDL receptors and modulating cellular catabolism of LDL and VLDL by this pathway.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1995
11705989,The alpha -chains of C4b-binding protein mediate complex formation with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein.,"C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is a heparin-binding protein that participates in both the complement and hemostatic system. We investigated the interaction between C4BP and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), an endocytic receptor involved in the catabolism of various heparin-binding proteins. Both plasma-derived C4BP and recombinant C4BP consisting of only its alpha-chains (rC4BPalpha) bound efficiently to immobilized LRP, as determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Complementary, two distinct fragments of LRP, i.e. clusters II and IV, both associated to immobilized rC4BPalpha, and binding could be inhibited by the LRP antagonist receptor-associated protein. Further analysis showed that association of rC4BPalpha to LRP was inhibited by heparin or by anti-C4BP antibody RU-3B9, which recognizes the heparin-binding region of the C4BP alpha-chains. In cellular degradation experiments, LRP-expressing fibroblasts effectively degraded (125)I-labeled rC4BPalpha, whereas their LRP-deficient counterparts displayed a 4-fold diminished capacity of degrading (125)I-rC4BPalpha. Finally, initial clearance of C4BP in mice was significantly delayed upon co-injection with receptor-associated protein. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the alpha-chains of C4BP comprise a binding site for LRP. We propose that LRP mediates at least in part the catabolism of C4BP and, as such, may regulate C4BP participation in complement and hemostatic processes.",,
8223488,The alpha 1 beta 1 integrin recognition site of the basement membrane collagen molecule [alpha 1(IV)]2 alpha 2(IV).,"Cells interact with type IV collagen mainly via the integrins alpha 1 beta 1 and alpha 2 beta 1. A triple helical CNBr derived fragment CB3[IV], which contains the recognition sites for both integrins, was isolated from type IV collagen. Trypsin treatment of CB3[IV] gave rise to four smaller fragments, F1-F4, of which the smallest one, F4, contained the recognition site for alpha 1 beta 1. Further fragmentation of F4 by thermolysin treatment at 50 degrees C led to fragment TL1, which represents the C-terminal half of F4, and which was no longer able to interact with alpha 1 beta 1. Therefore the recognition site of alpha 1 beta 1 had to be located within the N-terminal half of F4, a position which was verified by electron micrographs of a crosslinked F2-alpha 1 beta 1 complex. Modification of the Arg and Asp residues, which abolished the binding activity of F4, led to the identification of Arg (461) within the alpha 2(IV) and Asp (461) within the alpha 1 (IV) chain as essential residues for the alpha 1 beta 1. The array of these two residues on the surface of the triple helix is discussed.",,
2156854,The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin cell surface collagen receptor binds to the alpha 1 (I)-CB3 peptide of collagen.,"We have previously shown that platelets adhere to collagen substrates via a Mg2(+)-dependent mechanism mediated by the surface glycoprotein Ia-IIa (human leukocyte very late activation protein 2, alpha 2 beta 1 integrin) complex. The adhesion is specific for collagen and is supported by collagen types I, II, III, IV, and VI. Several other members of the integrin family of adhesive protein receptors recognize discrete linear amino acid sequences within their adhesive glycoprotein ligands. Experiments with both intact platelets and with liposomes containing the purified receptor complex indicated that the alpha 2 beta 1 receptor recognized denatured type I collagen in a Mg2(+)-dependent manner. To further localize the binding site, the alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains of type I collagen were purified by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography and tested as adhesive substrates. Both the alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) chains effectively supported Mg2(+)-dependent platelet adhesion. The purified alpha 1(I) collagen chain was then subjected to cleavage with cyanogen bromide, and the resultant peptides were separated by chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose. Only the alpha 1(I)-CB3 fragment supported Mg2(+)-dependent platelet adhesion. The monoclonal antibody P1H5 which recognizes an epitope on the alpha 2 subunit of the integrin receptor and which inhibits the adhesion of both intact platelets and liposomes bearing the purified receptor to collagen also inhibited platelet adhesion to the alpha 1(I)-CB3 fragment. These results indicate that the alpha 2 beta 1 receptor recognizes a sequence of amino acids present in the alpha 1(I)-CB3 fragment of type I collagen. An identical or similar sequence likely mediates binding of the receptor to other collagen polypeptides.",,
2169434,"The alpha 2B adrenergic receptor of undifferentiated neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG108-15 cells, interacts directly with the guanine nucleotide binding protein, Gi2.","In membranes of undifferentiated neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cell line NG108-15, the apparent specific binding of [3H]yohimbine measured in the presence of 1 microM noradrenaline, was increased substantially by the presence of the poorly hydrolysed analogue of GTP, guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (Gpp[NH]p) or by preincubation of membranes with antibodies against the C-terminal decapeptide of the alpha subunit of the G-protein Gi2. Such an effect was not produced by antibodies against the equivalent region of Go alpha Gi3 alpha or Gs alpha or from non-immune serum. By contrast, total specific binding of [3H]yohimbine was not modified by co-incubation with Gpp[NH]p or by preincubation with the antibodies from any of the anti-G protein antisera. These results demonstrate a direct interaction of the alpha 2B adrenergic receptor of NG108-15 cells with Gi2.",,
9117345,"The alpha 4 beta 1 fibronectin ligands CS-1, Hep II, and RGD induce different intracellular events in B lymphoid cells. Comparison with the effects of the endothelial ligand VCAM-1.","The lymphocyte integrin alpha 4 beta 1 is the receptor for the Hep II domain and CS-1 site in fibronectin (Fn) as well as for VCAM-1. We recently showed that upon activation with anti-beta 1 mAb TS2/16, alpha 4 beta 1 also recognizes the RGD Fn sequence. To determine the physiological role of these multiple interactions, we have now studied some intracellular events induced by ""resting"" and activated alpha 4 beta 1 binding to its different ligands. Analyses of actin and tubulin reorganization upon adhesion of B lymphoid cells to Fn fragments or VCAM-1 showed that VCAM-1, a 38 kDa fragment (Hep II+CS-1), and the CS-1 synthetic peptide induced formation of transient cytoplasmic projections; however, cells attached to a 58 kDa (Hep II) or 80 kDa (RGD) fragments remained rounded. Using transfilter assays, we showed that VCAM-1, 38 kDa and CS-1 also induced dose-dependent B cell migration mediated by alpha 4 beta 1. Furthermore, these three ligands, but not the 80 kDa fragment or a synthetic peptide (H1) containing a sequence from Hep II shown to bind alpha 4 beta 1, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 110 kDa protein. Activation of alpha 4 beta 1 with TS2/16 inhibited the cytoplasmic protrusions and cell migration but did not affect the pattern of phosphorylation. Our results indicate that the various alpha 4 beta 1 ligands induce different cellular responses. Most importantly they show that alpha 4 beta 1 interaction with CS-1 is sufficient to trigger intracellular events in B cells. Furthermore, they suggest a regulation by the activation form of the receptor as well as by the ligand in events involving lymphocyte adhesion and migration.",,
10342833,The alpha-subunit of human choriogonadotropin interacts with the exodomain of the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor.,"The LH/CG receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, consists of two parts, the N-terminal extracellular segment (exodomain) and the membrane-associated C-terminal segment (endodomain). hCG initially binds the exodomain of the receptor and then, the hormone/exodomain complex is thought to make the secondary contact with the endodomain of the receptor and generate a hormone signal. However, little direct evidence is available about which hormone subunits (alpha or beta) interact with which domains of the receptor. To determine whether the alpha-subunit contacts the exodomain of its receptor, hCG containing [125I]alpha and truncated exodomain lacking the endodomain were prepared. They were chemically cross-linked, and the resulting cross-linked complexes were solubilized and electrophoresed. The results indicate that the alpha-subunit of hCG was directly and specifically cross-linked to the exodomain. To verify the cross-linked exodomain by the independent method, the Flag epitope was inserted between the signal sequence and the mature exodomain. hCG containing [125I]alpha was cross-linked to the Flag exodomain, and the resulting cross-linked hCG/Flag exodomain complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. The results show that the material cross-linked to hCG containing [125I]alpha is indeed the exodomain. In conclusion, our results show the direct interaction of the alpha-subunit with the exodomain and, therefore, its crucial role in the hormone-receptor interaction in addition to its involvement in signal generation.",Endocrinology,1999
10702270,The alpha(4) integrin subunit Tyr(187) has a key role in alpha(4)beta(7)-dependent cell adhesion.,"The integrin alpha(4)beta(7) is the cell adhesion receptor for the mucosal vascular addressin MAdCAM-1, and this interaction is dominant in lymphocyte homing to Peyer's patch high endothelial venules, and plays key roles in lymphocyte recruitment at sites of inflammation. To identify alpha(4) subunit amino acids important for alpha(4)beta(7)/MAdCAM-1 interaction, we expressed mutant alpha(4) and wild type beta(7) chains in K562 cells and analyzed the effect of the mutations on cell adhesion to a soluble MAdCAM-1 (sMAdCAM-1-Ig). Transfectants expressing mutated alpha(4) at Tyr(187) displayed a substantial decrease in adhesion to this ligand, which was associated with a reduced alpha(4)beta(7)/sMAdCAM-1-Ig interaction, as determined by soluble binding assays. Addition of Mn(2+) to the adhesion assays did not restore the impaired adhesion. Mutations at alpha(4) Gln(152)Asp(153) also affected transfectant adhesion to sMAdCAM-1-Ig, but did not involve an alteration of alpha(4)beta(7)/MAdCAM-1 binding, and adhesion was restored by Mn(2+). Instead, mutations at alpha(4) Asn(123)Glu(124) did not affect this adhesion. Mutation of alpha(4) Tyr(187) abolished alpha(4)beta(7)-mediated cell adhesion to CS-1/fibronectin, an additional ligand for alpha(4)beta(7), while alpha(4) Gln(152)Asp(153) transfectant mutants showed a reduced adhesion. These results identify alpha(4) Tyr(187) as a key residue during receptor alpha(4)beta(7)/ligand interactions, indicating that it plays important roles in alpha(4)beta(7)-mediated leukocyte adhesion, and provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention in several inflammatory pathologies.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
9287323,The amino-terminal domain of CCR2 is both necessary and sufficient for high affinity binding of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1. Receptor activation by a pseudo-tethered ligand.,"High affinity binding of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) requires the presence of the amino-terminal domain of CCR2, the MCP-1 receptor. Here we report that the 35 amino-terminal residues of CCR2, expressed as a membrane-bound fusion protein, bound MCP-1 with an affinity similar to that of the intact, wild-type receptor. Furthermore, the amino-terminal fusion protein enhanced, in trans, agonist-dependent activation of a CCR2 variant that was engineered to lack the high affinity binding sites for MCP-1. Mutation of highly conserved cysteines in the amino-terminal domain and third extracellular loop of CCR2, but not in the fusion protein, resulted in a dramatic loss of MCP-1 binding, suggesting the existence of a critical intramolecular disulfide bond that positions the amino-terminal protein for ligand interaction. These data indicate that the amino-terminal region of CCR2 is both necessary and sufficient for the high affinity binding of MCP-1 and provide the first direct evidence for activation of a chemokine receptor by a pseudo-tethered ligand. In this model, high affinity binding by the relatively short amino-terminal domain of CCR2 serves to tether MCP-1 and enhance low affinity interactions with distal regions of the receptor.",,

These ligands correspond to protein S, a protease regulator that is a potent anticoagulant, and Gas6, a protein related to protein S but lacking any known function. Our results are reminiscent of recent findings that the procoagulant thrombin, a protease that drives clot formation by cleaving fibrinogen to form fibrin, also binds and activates intracellular signaling via a G protein-coupled cell surface receptor. Proteases and protease regulators that also activate specific cell surface receptors may serve to integrate coagulation with associated cellular responses required for tissue repair and growth, as well as to coordinate protease cascades and associated cellular responses in other systems, such as those involved in growth and remodeling of the nervous system.",Cell,1995

We hypothesized that different interactions with KIR immune receptors could contribute to the difference in disease association between HLA-B*27:05 and HLAB*27:09. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the formation of β2m-free heavy chain (FHC) including B27 dimers (B272) by HLA-B*27:05 and HLA-B*27:09 and their binding to KIR immunoreceptors.",,
8663053,The AT2 receptor selectively associates with Gialpha2 and Gialpha3 in the rat fetus.,"The effects of angiotensin II are mediated by a family of seven transmembrane receptors. In the adult, the majority of the receptors are of the AT1 isoform, which is coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins (either Gqalpha or Gialpha). In contrast, the AT2 receptor is expressed at low levels in the adult but is the major form expressed in the fetal and neonatal animal. Previous results have failed to show G protein coupling of the AT2 receptor in the fetus. We now provide evidence that the AT2 receptor is G protein-coupled. An antibody that binds several Galpha subunits immunoselected angiotensin II receptor-Galpha complexes. In addition, Gialpha1-3 antibody, which recognizes Gialpha1, Gialpha2 and Gialpha3, also co-immunoselect the AT2 receptor. Anti-Gialpha2 and anti-Gialpha3 antibodies were both able to co-immunoselected AT2 receptor-Gialpha complexes, but consistent with the lack of Gialpha1 in the fetal extracts, anti-Gialpha1 antibodies did not nor did any other G protein-directed antisera. The finding that AT2 receptor couples to both Gialpha2 and Gialpha3 raises the possibility that selective interactions between AT2 receptor and different G proteins may result in specific cellular effects mediated by AT2 stimulation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
16563432,The autocrine motility factor (AMF) and AMF-receptor combination needs sugar chain recognition ability and interaction using the C-terminal region of AMF.,"The autocrine motility factor (AMF) promotes cellular locomotion or invasion, and regulates tumor angiogenesis or ascites accumulation. These signals are triggered by binding between AMF and its receptor (AMFR), a glycoprotein on the cell surface. AMF has been identified as phosphohexose isomerase (PHI). Previous reports have suggested that the substrate-recognition of exo-PHI is significant for receptor binding. Crystallographic studies have shown that AMF consists of three domains, and that the substrate or inhibitor of PHI is stored between the large and small domains, corresponding to approximately residues 117-288. Here, site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate 18 recombinant human AMF point mutants involving critical amino acid residues for substrate or enzyme inhibitor recognition or binding. Mutation of residues that interact with the phosphate group of the PHI substrate significantly reduced the cell motility-stimulating activity. Their binding capacities for AMFR were also lower than wild-type human AMF. Mutants that retained the enzymic activity showed the motility-stimulating effect and receptor binding and had sensitivity to a PHI inhibitor. Mutant AMFR lacking the N-sugar chain was expressed on the cell membrane but did not respond to AMF-stimulation, and N-glycosidase-treated AMFR did not compete with receptor binding of AMF. Furthermore, the AMF domains that contain the substrate storage domain and C-terminal region stimulate cell locomotion. These results suggest that the N-glyco side-chain of AMFR is a trigger and that interaction between the 117-C-terminal part of AMF and the extracellular core protein of AMFR is needed during AMF-AMFR interactions.",Journal of molecular biology,2006

It has been well established that the clearance of FVIII from the circulation involves mechanisms that are sensitive to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family antagonist receptor-associated protein (RAP), including LDLR-related protein. Because FVIII clearance in the presence of a bolus injection of RAP still occurs fairly efficient, also RAP-independent mechanisms are likely to be involved.",,

Two CD22 polypeptides have been characterized and suggested to play a role in B cell-B cell interaction as well as in B cell adhesion to monocytes. In this work we provide evidence that CD22 is directly involved in the cognate interaction between B and T cells. One of the two CD22 polypeptides, CD22 beta, interacts with a specific ligand on a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells. Our results suggest that the T cell ligand of CD22 is CD45RO, an isoform of the leukocyte common antigen class of phosphotyrosine phosphatases associated with the helper T cell phenotype. We further demonstrate that CD22 recognizes a second ligand, CD75, expressed predominantly on activated B cells and shown to be a cell surface alpha 2-6 sialyltransferase.",,
19528259,The B7 family member B7-H6 is a tumor cell ligand for the activating natural killer cell receptor NKp30 in humans.,"Cancer development is often associated with the lack of specific and efficient recognition of tumor cells by the immune system. Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that participate in the elimination of tumors. We report the identification of a tumor cell surface molecule that binds NKp30, a human receptor which triggers antitumor NK cell cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. This previously unannotated gene belongs to the B7 family and, hence, was designated B7-H6. B7-H6 triggers NKp30-mediated activation of human NK cells. B7-H6 was not detected in normal human tissues but was expressed on human tumor cells, emphasizing that the expression of stress-induced self-molecules associated with cell transformation serves as a mode of cell recognition in innate immunity.",The Journal of experimental medicine,2009
11116158,The BBXB motif of RANTES is the principal site for heparin binding and controls receptor selectivity.,"The chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; CCL5) binds selectively to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate. The primary sequence of RANTES contains two clusters of basic residues, (44)RKNR(47) and (55)KKWVR(59). The first is a BBXB motif common in heparin-binding proteins, and the second is located in the loop directly preceding the C-terminal helix. We have mutated these residues to alanine, both as point mutations as well as triple mutations of the 40s and 50s clusters. Using a binding assay to heparin beads with radiolabeled proteins, the (44)AANA(47) mutant demonstrated an 80% reduction in its capacity to bind heparin, whereas the (55)AAWVA(59) mutant retained full binding capacity. Mutation of the (44)RKNR(47) site reduced the selectivity of RANTES binding to different GAGs. The mutants were tested for their integrity by receptor binding assays on CCR1 and CCR5 as well as their ability to induce chemotaxis in vitro. In all assays the single point mutations and the triple 50s cluster mutation caused no significant difference in activity compared with the wild type sequence. However, the triple 40s mutant showed a 80-fold reduction in affinity for CCR1, despite normal binding to CCR5. It was only able to induce monocyte chemotaxis at micromolar concentrations. The triple 40s mutant was also able to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity, but consistent with its abrogated GAG binding capacity, it no longer induced enhanced infectivity at high concentrations.",,
10446903,The beta-subunit of human choriogonadotropin interacts with the exodomain of the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor and changes its interaction with the alpha-subunit.,"Human CG (hCG) consists of a common alpha-subunit and a hormone-specific beta-subunit. Similarly, its receptor is also composed of two domains, an extracellular N-terminal half (exodomain) and a membrane-associated C-terminal half (endodomain). hCG initially binds the exodomain of the receptor after which the resulting hCG/exodomain complex is thought to interact with the endodomain. This secondary interaction is considered responsible for signal generation. Despite the importance, it is unclear which hormone subunit interacts with the exodomain or the endodomain. As a step to determine the mechanisms of the initial and secondary interactions and signal generation, we investigated the interaction of the hormone-specific beta-subunit in hCG with the receptor's exodomain. A photoactivable hCG derivative consisting of the wild-type alpha-subunit and a photoactivable beta-subunit derivative was prepared and used to label the exodomain. The analysis and immunoprecipitation of photoaffinity labeled exodomain demonstrate that the beta-subunit in hCG makes the direct contact with the exodomain.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",1999
12667445,The BMP7/ActRII extracellular domain complex provides new insights into the cooperative nature of receptor assembly.,"Activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) elicit diverse biological responses by signaling through two pairs of structurally related type I and type II receptors. Here we report the crystal structure of BMP7 in complex with the extracellular domain (ECD) of the activin type II receptor. Our structure produces a compelling four-receptor model, revealing that the types I and II receptor ECDs make no direct contacts. Nevertheless, we find that truncated receptors lacking their cytoplasmic domain retain the ability to cooperatively assemble in the cell membrane. Also, the affinity of BMP7 for its low-affinity type I receptor ECD increases 5-fold in the presence of its type II receptor ECD. Taken together, our results provide a view of the ligand-mediated cooperative assembly of BMP and activin receptors that does not rely on receptor-receptor contacts.",Molecular cell,2003

Rabbit antisera to a recombinant v-fms-coded polypeptide precipitated the feline c-fms product and specifically cross-reacted with a 165 kd glycoprotein from mouse macrophages. This putative product of the murine c-fms gene exhibited an associated tyrosine kinase activity in immune complexes, specifically bound murine CSF-1, and, in the presence of the growth factor, was phosphorylated on tyrosine in membrane preparations. The murine c-fms proto-oncogene product and the CSF-1 receptor are therefore related, and possibly identical, molecules.",,
10990458,The C-terminal cytoplasmic Lys-thr-X-X-X-Trp motif in frizzled receptors mediates Wnt/beta-catenin signalling.,"Frizzled receptors are components of the Wnt signalling pathway, but how they activate the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is not clear. Here we use three distinct vertebrate frizzled receptors (Xfz3, Xfz4 and Xfz7) and describe whether and how their C-terminal cytoplasmic regions transduce the Wnt/beta-catenin signal. We show that Xfz3 activates this pathway in the absence of exogenous ligands, while Xfz4 and Xfz7 interact with Xwnt5A to activate this pathway. Analysis using chimeric receptors reveals that their C-terminal cytoplasmic regions are functionally equivalent in Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Furthermore, a conserved motif (Lys-Thr-X-X-X-Trp) located two amino acids after the seventh transmembrane domain is required for activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and for membrane relocalization and phosphorylation of Dishevelled. Frizzled receptors with point mutations affecting either of the three conserved residues are defective in Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. These findings provide functional evidence supporting a role of this conserved motif in the modulation of Wnt signalling. They are consistent with the genetic features exhibited by Drosophila Dfz3 and Caenorhabditis elegans mom-5 in which the tryptophan is substituted by a tyrosine.",,
9431988,"The C-terminal domain V of perlecan promotes beta1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion, binds heparin, nidogen and fibulin-2 and can be modified by glycosaminoglycans.","Domain V of the major basement-membrane proteoglycan perlecan, a domain which consists of three laminin type G (LG) and four epidermal-growth-factor-like (EG) modules, was obtained in recombinant form by transfecting embryonic kidney cells with an episomal expression vector. A major 90-kDa fragment V was obtained together with fragments Va (74 kDa) and Vb (26 kDa) which were generated by endogenous proteolysis in front of the most C-terminal LG module. All three fragments bound to a heparin affinity column and could be displaced at a moderate (0.2 M) NaCl concentration. Rotary-shadowing electron microscopy demonstrated a three-globule structure for fragment V. Fragment V also showed a strong immunological cross-reaction with tissue-derived perlecan, indicating that it was folded into a native structure. A further, larger fragment, Vc, was apparently substituted with heparan sulphate and/or chondroitin sulphate chains and failed to bind to heparin. Fragment V but not fragment Vc promoted a distinct adhesion of several cell lines and this could be blocked by antibodies against the integrin beta1 chain. This domain may, however, represent only one of several cell-adhesive sites of perlecan. The recombinant perlecan fragment V bound in surface plasmon resonance assays to fibulin-2, laminin-nidogen complex, nidogen and two nidogen fragments. This indicated two different nidogen-binding epitopes on perlecan domain V with about a 10-fold difference in their affinities (Kd = 0.05-0.2 microM and about 2 microM). Perlecan domain V therefore seems to participate in the supramolecular assembly and cell connections of basement membranes.",European journal of biochemistry,1997
14701797,The C-terminal nonapeptide of mature chemerin activates the chemerin receptor with low nanomolar potency.,"Chemerin is a novel protein identified as the natural ligand of ChemR23 (chemerinR), a previously orphan G protein-coupled receptor expressed in immature dendritic cells and macrophages. Chemerin is synthesized as a secreted precursor, prochemerin, which is poorly active, but converted into a full agonist of chemerinR by proteolytic removal of the last six amino acids. In the present work, we have synthesized a number of peptides derived from the C-terminal domain of human prochemerin and have investigated their functional properties as agonists or antagonists of human chemerinR. We found that the nonapeptide (149)YFPGQFAFS(157) (chemerin-9), corresponding to the C terminus of processed chemerin, retained most of the activity of the full-size protein, with regard to agonism toward the chemerinR. Extension of this peptide at its N terminus did not increase the activity, whereas further truncations rapidly resulted in inactive compounds. The C-terminal end of the peptide appeared crucial for its activity, as addition of a single amino acid or removal of two amino acids modified the potency by four orders of magnitude. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified residues Tyr(149), Phe(150), Gly(152), Phe(154), and Phe(156) as the key positions for chemerinR activation. A modified peptide (YHSFFFPGQFAFS) was synthesized and iodinated, and a radioligand binding assay was established. It was found that the ability of the various peptides to activate the chemerin receptor was strictly correlated with their affinity in the binding assay. These results confirm that a precise C-terminal processing is required for the generation of a chemerinR agonist. The possibility to restrict a medium sized protein to a nonapeptide, while keeping a low nanomolar affinity for its receptor is unusual among G protein-coupled receptors ligands. The identification of these short bioactive peptides will considerably accelerate the pharmacological analysis of chemerin-chemerinR interactions.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2004

C1qR also interacts with the collectins SP-A, MBL, CL43 and conglutinin via a cluster of charged residues on the collagen tails of the ligands. In order to localise C1q and collectin binding activity within C1qR/CRT, recombinant C1qR/CRT domains [N (residues 18-196), P (197-308) and C (309-417)] were produced. Both the N- and P-domains bound to C1q, demonstrating that the binding site spans the intersection of these domains. Amino acid alignment analysis identified a putative CUB module within this region. This S-domain (residues 160-283) was expressed and showed concentration-dependent binding to immobilised C1q, demonstrating that it contains the C1q binding site. Competitive inhibition studies of the S-domain-C1q interaction revealed that the S-domain binds to C1q collagen tails and to the collectin proteins, SP-A, MBL, CL43 and conglutinin. The C1q and collection binding site on C1qR/CRT has therefore been localised to the S-domain.",,

10964907,The calcium-independent receptor for alpha-latrotoxin from human and rodent brains interacts with members of the ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank family of multidomain proteins.,"Subtypes of the calcium-independent receptors for alpha-latrotoxin (CIRL1-3) define a distinct subgroup within the large family of the seven-transmembrane region cell surface receptors. The physiological function of CIRLs is unknown because neither extracellular ligands nor intracellular coupling proteins (G-proteins) have been identified. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a novel interaction between the C termini of CIRL1 and -2 and the PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain of a recently discovered multidomain protein family (ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank) present in human and rat brain. In vitro, CIRL1 and CIRL2 interacted strongly with the PDZ domain of ProSAP1. The specificity of this interaction has been verified by in vivo experiments using solubilized rat brain membrane fractions and ProSAP1 antibodies; only CIRL1, but not CIRL2, was co-immunoprecipitated with ProSAP1. In situ hybridization revealed that ProSAP1 and CIRL1 are co-expressed in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Colocalization was also observed at the subcellular level, as both CIRL1 and ProSAP1 are enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction from rat brain. Expression of all three CIRL isoforms is highly regulated during postnatal brain development, with CIRL3 exhibiting its highest expression levels immediately after birth, followed by CIRL2 and finally CIRL1 in aged rats.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
7510694,The carboxyl-terminal domain of lipoprotein lipase binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP) and mediates binding of normal very low density lipoproteins to LRP.,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) binds with high affinity to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP) and promotes binding, uptake, and degradation of normal triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in a process mediated by LRP (Chappell, D. A., Fry, G. L., Naknitx, M.A., Muhonen, L. E., Pladet, M. W., Iverius, P-H., and Strickland, D. K. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14168-14175). To localize the portion of LPL that is responsible for interacting with LRP, fragments of LPL were expressed in bacteria. A fragment of human LPL containing the COOH-terminal domain (residues 313-448, designated LPLC) which lacks the catalytic site was able to bind to LRP. Purified LRP bound specifically to microtiter wells coated with LPL or LPLC with KD values of 2.8 and 5 nM, respectively. The effects of several mutations of LPLC were tested. Mutation of Lys407 to Ala reduced the affinity of LPLC for LRP by approximately 10-fold. Like native LPL, LPLC prevented the binding of activated alpha 2-macroglobulin and the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein to LRP and inhibited the internalization and degradation of activated alpha 2-macroglobulin and receptor-associated protein in cultured fibroblasts. LPLC also bound to 125I-labeled human normal triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and promoted their binding to purified LRP and to cultured cells. Mutation of Trp393 and Trp394 to Ala completely abolished the ability of LPLC to bind to lipoproteins, but had little effect on its interaction with LRP. These data indicate that the COOH-terminal domain of LPL may function both in binding lipoproteins and mediating their interaction with LRP.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1994
11342595,The CCR7 ligand elc (CCL19) is transcytosed in high endothelial venules and mediates T cell recruitment.,"Lymphocyte homing to secondary lymphoid tissue is defined by a multistep sequence of interactions between lymphocytes and endothelial cells in high endothelial venules (HEVs). After initial selectin-mediated tethering and rolling, firm adhesion of lymphocytes requires rapid upregulation of lymphocyte integrin adhesiveness. This step is mediated in part by the HEV-derived chemokine SLC (secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine, or CCL21) that binds to the CC chemokine receptor (CCR)7 on lymphocytes. However, the CC chemokine ELC (Epstein-Barr virus-induced molecule 1 ligand chemokine, or CCL19) shares the same receptor, and ELC transcripts have been observed in the T cell areas of lymphoid organs. Here, we show that perivascular ELC is transcytosed to the luminal surfaces of HEVs and enables efficient T cell homing to lymph nodes. In situ hybridization on sections of human tonsil showed no ELC mRNA in HEVs, but immunostaining revealed ELC protein in cytoplasmic vesicles of HEV cells. Furthermore, ELC injected into the footpads of mice entered the draining lymph nodes and was presented by HEVs. Finally, intracutaneous injections of ELC in mice lacking functionally relevant ELC and SLC (plt/plt mice) restored T cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes as efficiently as SLC. We conclude that perivascular ELC is transcytosed to the luminal surfaces of HEVs and participates in CCR7-mediated triggering of lymphocyte arrest.",The Journal of experimental medicine,2001

23086448,The CD46-Jagged1 interaction is critical for human TH1 immunity.,"CD46 is a complement regulator with important roles related to the immune response. CD46 functions as a pathogen receptor and is a potent costimulator for the induction of interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-secreting effector T helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells and their subsequent switch into interleukin 10 (IL-10)-producing regulatory T cells. Here we identified the Notch family member Jagged1 as a physiological ligand for CD46. Furthermore, we found that CD46 regulated the expression of Notch receptors and ligands during T cell activation and that disturbance of the CD46-Notch crosstalk impeded induction of IFN-γ and switching to IL-10. Notably, CD4(+) T cells from CD46-deficient patients and patients with hypomorphic mutations in the gene encoding Jagged1 (Alagille syndrome) failed to mount appropriate T(H)1 responses in vitro and in vivo, which suggested that CD46-Jagged1 crosstalk is responsible for the recurrent infections in subpopulations of these patients.",,
11447115,The cell polarity protein ASIP/PAR-3 directly associates with junctional adhesion molecule (JAM).,"The establishment and maintenance of cellular polarity are critical for the development of multicellular organisms. PAR (partitioning-defective) proteins were identified in Caenorhabditis elegans as determinants of asymmetric cell division and polarized cell growth. Recently, vertebrate orthologues of two of these proteins, ASIP/PAR-3 and PAR-6, were found to form a signalling complex with the small GTPases Cdc42/Rac1 and with atypical protein kinase C (PKC). Here we show that ASIP/PAR-3 associates with the tight-junction-associated protein junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) in vitro and in vivo. No binding was observed with claudin-1, -4 or -5. In fibroblasts and CHO cells overexpressing JAM, endogenous ASIP is recruited to JAM at sites of cell-cell contact. Over expression of truncated JAM lacking the extracellular part disrupts ASIP/PAR-3 localization at intercellular junctions and delays ASIP/PAR-3 recruitment to newly formed cell junctions. During junction formation, JAM appears early in primordial forms of junctions. Our data suggest that the ASIP/PAR-3-aPKC complex is tethered to tight junctions via its association with JAM, indicating a potential role for JAM in the generation of cell polarity in epithelial cells.",,
2946959,The cell surface receptors for interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta are identical.,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a factor that can induce proliferation of murine T lymphocytes and can elicit a variety of other biological responses. These include bone resorption, fibroblast proliferation, acute phase protein release from hepatocytes, cartilage breakdown and fever. This spectrum of activities is consistent with a role for IL-1 as a mediator of inflammation. Recently, sequence data have shown that there are at least two members of the IL-1 family; these distantly related proteins have been termed IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. We have found previously that both murine T cells and fibroblasts possess a relative molecular mass (Mr) approximately 80,000 (80K) plasma membrane receptor for human IL-1 beta. We show here that the receptor for IL-1 alpha on both murine and human cells is identical to that for IL-1 beta. This result raises the issue of what separation, if any, there might be between the biological activities of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta.",,
7721852,The cellular internalization and degradation of hepatic lipase is mediated by low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and requires cell surface proteoglycans.,"Hepatic lipase (HL) and lipoprotein lipase (LpL) are structurally related lipolytic enzymes that have distinct functions in lipoprotein catabolism. In addition to its lipolytic activity, LpL binds to very low density lipoproteins and promotes their interaction with the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (Chappell, D. A., Fry, G. L., Waknitz, M. A., Muhonen, L. E., Pladet M. W., Iverius, P. H., and Strickland, D. K. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14168-14175). In vitro binding assays revealed that HL also binds to purified LRP with a KD of 52 nM. Its binding to LRP is inhibited by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), a known LRP antagonist, and by heparin. 125I-Labeled HL is rapidly internalized and degraded by HepG2 cell lines, and approximately 70% of the cellular internalization and degradation is blocked by either exogenously added RAP or anti-LRP IgG. Mouse fibroblasts that lack LRP display a greatly diminished capacity to internalize and degrade HL when compared to control fibroblasts. These data indicate that LRP-mediated cellular uptake of HL accounts for a substantial portion of the internalization of this molecule. Proteoglycans have been shown to participate in the clearance of LpL, and consequently a role for proteoglycans in HL clearance pathway was also investigated. Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that are deficient in proteoglycan biosynthesis were unable to internalize or degrade 125I-HL despite the fact that these cells express LRP. Thus, the initial binding of HL to cell surface proteoglycans is an obligatory step for the delivery of the enzyme to LRP for endocytosis. A small, but significant, amount of 125I-HL was internalized in LRP deficient cells indicating that an LRP-independent pathway for HL internalization does exist. This pathway could involve cell surface proteoglycans, the LDL receptor, or some other unidentified surface protein.",,
12725245,The chemical synthesis and binding affinity to the EGF receptor of the EGF-like domain of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF).,"Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), which belongs to the EGF-family of growth factors, was isolated from the conditioned medium of macrophage-like cells. To investigate the effect of N- and C-terminal residues of the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF in the binding affinity to the EGF receptor on A431 cell. We synthesized HB-EGF(44-86) corresponding to the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF and its N- or C-terminal truncated peptides. Thermolytic digestion demonstrated three disulfide bond pairings of the EGF-like domain in HB-EGF is consistent with that of human-EGF and human-TGF-alpha. HB-EGF(44-86) showed high binding affinity to EGF-receptor, like human-EGF. The truncation of the C-terminal Leu86 residue from HB-EGF(44-86), HB-EGF(45-86) or HB-EGF(46-86) caused a drastic reduction in the binding affinity to the EGF receptor. These results suggest that the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF plays an important role in the binding to the EGF receptor, and its C-terminal Leu86 residue is necessary for binding with the EGF-receptor. In addition, the deletion of the two N-terminal residues (Asp44-Pro45) from HB-EGF(44-86) caused a 10-fold decrease in relative binding affinity to the EGF receptor. This indicates that the two N-terminal residues of the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF are necessary for its optimal binding affinity to the EGF receptor.",Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,2003
24789099,The chemokine fractalkine can activate integrins without CX3CR1 through direct binding to a ligand-binding site distinct from the classical RGD-binding site.,"The chemokine domain of fractalkine (FKN-CD) binds to the classical RGD-binding site of αvβ3 and that the resulting ternary complex formation (integrin-FKN-CX3CR1) is critical for CX3CR1 signaling and FKN-induced integrin activation. However, only certain cell types express CX3CR1. Here we studied if FKN-CD can activate integrins in the absence of CX3CR1. We describe that WT FKN-CD activated recombinant soluble αvβ3 in cell-free conditions, but the integrin-binding defective mutant of FKN-CD (K36E/R37E) did not. This suggests that FKN-CD can activate αvβ3 in the absence of CX3CR1 through the direct binding of FKN-CD to αvβ3. WT FKN-CD activated αvβ3 on CX3CR1-negative cells (K562 and CHO) but K36E/R37E did not, suggesting that FKN-CD can activate integrin at the cellular levels in a manner similar to that in cell-free conditions. We hypothesized that FKN-CD enhances ligand binding to the classical RGD-binding site (site 1) through binding to a second binding site (site 2) that is distinct from site 1 in αvβ3. To identify the possible second FKN-CD binding site we performed docking simulation of αvβ3-FKN-CD interaction using αvβ3 with a closed inactive conformation as a target. The simulation predicted a potential FKN-CD-binding site in inactive αvβ3 (site 2), which is located at a crevice between αv and β3 on the opposite side of site 1 in the αvβ3 headpiece. We studied if FKN-CD really binds to site 2 using a peptide that is predicted to interact with FKN-CD in site 2. Notably the peptide specifically bound to FKN-CD and effectively suppressed integrin activation by FKN-CD. This suggests that FKN-CD actually binds to site 2, and this leads to integrin activation. We obtained very similar results in α4β1 and α5β1. The FKN binding to site 2 and resulting integrin activation may be a novel mechanism of integrin activation and of FKN signaling.",PloS one,2014
16107333,The chemokine SDF-1/CXCL12 binds to and signals through the orphan receptor RDC1 in T lymphocytes.,"Combined phylogenetic and chromosomal location studies suggest that the orphan receptor RDC1 is related to CXC chemokine receptors. RDC1 provides a co-receptor function for a restricted number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates, in particular for the CXCR4-using HIV-2 ROD strain. Here we show that CXCL12, the only known natural ligand for CXCR4, binds to and signals through RDC1. We demonstrate that RDC1 is expressed in T lymphocytes and that CXCL12-promoted chemotaxis is inhibited by an anti-RDC1 monoclonal antibody. Concomitant blockade of RDC1 and CXCR4 produced additive inhibitory effects in CXCL12-induced T cell migration. Furthermore, we provide evidence that interaction of CXCL12 with RDC1 is specific, saturable, and of high affinity (apparent KD approximately 0.4 nM). In CXCR4-negative cells expressing RDC1, CXCL12 promotes internalization of the receptor and chemotactic signals through RDC1. Collectively, our data indicate that RDC1, which we propose to rename as CXCR7, is a receptor for CXCL12.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2005
1847994,The chemotactic receptor for human C5a anaphylatoxin.,"Host defence and inflammatory responses are controlled and amplified by receptor-mediated events often initiated by a chemotactic factor that directs the approach of phagocytic cells. Complement receptors CR1 and CR3 are responsible for the phagocytic and adhesive properties of neutrophils, whereas the C5a receptor mediates the pro-inflammatory and chemotactic actions of the complement anaphylatoxin C5a. In addition to stimulating chemotaxis, granule enzyme release and superoxide anion production, this receptor stimulates upregulation of expression and activity of the adhesion molecule MAC-1, and of CR1, and a decrease in cell-surface glycoprotein 100MEL-14 on neutrophils. In vivo, the C5a receptor may participate in anaphylactoid and septic shock. The human C5a receptor was cloned from U937 and HL-60 cells and identified by high affinity binding when expressed in COS-7 cells. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the receptor reveals the expected motifs befitting its interaction with cellular GTP-binding proteins.",,
10812968,"The ciliary neurotrophic factor and its receptor, CNTFR alpha.","Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is expressed in glial cells within the central and peripheral nervous systems. CNTF stimulates gene expression, cell survival or differentiation in a variety of neuronal cell types such as sensory, sympathetic, ciliary and motor neurons. In addition, effects of CNTF on oligodendrocytes as well as denervated and intact skeletal muscle have been documented. CNTF itself lacks a classical signal peptide sequence of a secreted protein, but is thought to convey its cytoprotective effects after release from adult glial cells by some mechanism induced by injury. Interestingly, mice that are homozygous for an inactivated CNTF gene develop normally and initially thrive. Only later in adulthood do they exhibit a mild loss of motor neurons with resulting muscle weakness, leading to the suggestion that CNTF is not essential for neural development, but instead acts in response to injury or other stresses. The CNTF receptor complex is most closely related to, and shares subunits with the receptor complexes for interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor. The specificity conferring alpha subunit of the CNTF complex (CNTFR alpha), is extremely well conserved across species, and has a distribution localized predominantly to the nervous system and skeletal muscle. CNTFR alpha lacks a conventional transmembrane domain and is thought to be anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. Mice lacking CNTFR alpha die perinatally, perhaps indicating the existence of a second developmentally important CNTF-like ligand. Signal transduction by CNTF requires that it bind first to CNTFR alpha, permitting the recruitment of gp130 and LIFR beta, forming a tripartite receptor complex. CNTF-induced heterodimerization of the beta receptor subunits leads to tyrosine phosphorylation (through constitutively associated JAKs), and the activated receptor provides docking sites for SH2-containing signaling molecules, such as STAT proteins. Activated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to bind specific DNA sequences, resulting in enhanced transcription of responsive genes. The neuroprotective effects of CNTF have been demonstrated in a number of in vitro cell models as well as in vivo in mutant mouse strains which exhibit motor neuron degeneration. Intracerebral administration of CNTF and CNTF analogs has also been shown to protect striatal output neurons in rodent and primate models of Huntington's disease. Treatment of humans and animals with CNTF is also known to induce weight loss characterized by a preferential loss of body fat. When administered systemically, CNTF activates downstream signaling molecules such as STAT-3 in areas of the hypothalamus which regulate food intake. In addition to its neuronal actions, CNTF and analogs have been shown to act on non-neuronal cells such as glia, hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, embryonic stem cells and bone marrow stromal cells.",Pharmaceutica acta Helvetiae,2000
11285233,The ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha component induces the secretion of and is required for functional responses to cardiotrophin-like cytokine.,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is involved in the survival of a number of different neural cell types, including motor neurons. CNTF functional responses are mediated through a tripartite membrane receptor composed of two signalling receptor chains, gp130 and the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), associated with a non-signalling CNTF binding receptor alpha component (CNTFR). CNTFR-deficient mice show profound neuronal deficits at birth, leading to a lethal phenotype. In contrast, inactivation of the CNTF gene leads only to a slight muscle weakness, mainly during adulthood, suggesting that CNTFR binds to a second ligand that is important for development. Modelling studies of the interleukin-6 family member cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) revealed structural similarities with CNTF, including the conservation of a site I domain involved in binding to CNTFR. Co-expression of CLC and CNTFR in mammalian cells generates a secreted composite cytokine, displaying activities on cells expressing the gp130-LIFR complex on their surface. Correspondingly, CLC-CNTFR activates gp130, LIFR and STAT3 signalling components, and enhances motor neuron survival. Together, these observations demonstrate that CNTFR induces the secretion of CLC, as well as mediating the functional responses of CLC.",The EMBO journal,2001
12563219,The cleaved peptide of PAR1 is a more potent stimulant of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion than is thrombin.,"Platelet-endothelial cell adhesion is an important pathologic response to vessel injury or inflammation. On binding to its endothelial or platelet G protein-linked seven-transmembrane domain receptor, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), thrombin releases a 41-amino acid peptide (TR(1-41)). We examined the effect of TR(1-41) on platelet activation and on platelet-endothelial cell adhesion.",,
8624732,"The cloned mu, delta and kappa receptors and their endogenous ligands: evidence for two opioid peptide recognition cores.","The opioid peptides are derived from three prohormone precursors referred to as proopiomelanocortin (POMC), proenkephalin (ProEnk) and prodynorphin (ProDyn). Following specific cleavage, several biologically active peptides are generated that can bind to the mu, delta and kappa receptors. The present study examines the receptor binding affinities of the POMC, ProEnk and ProDyn peptides to the cloned mu, delta and kappa receptors expressed transiently in transfected COS-1 cells. Consistent with previous findings using brain homogenates, competition studies demonstrate that no opioid peptide family can be exclusively associated with a specific opioid receptor type. Short ProEnk peptides, such as Leu- and Met-enkephalin are selective for delta, but C-terminally extended peptides such as Met-Enk-Arg-Gly-Leu and Met-Enk-Arg-Phe have a high affinity to micro, delta and kappa. Similarly, Peptide E, the BAM peptides, and metorphamide have a high affinity for all three opioid receptor types. While dynorphin A peptides and alpha- and beta-neoendorphin have a preference for kappa, they also bind the cloned delta and mu receptors. Our findings do not easily fit a simple 'message-address' model where the Try-Gly-Gly-Phe core is extended and this gradually alters selectivity. Rather, the pattern appears more discontinuous, and would fit better with the idea of two similar but distinct cores; a Try-Gly-Gly-Phe Met- or Leu core that is necessary and sufficient for mu and delta but not kappa and a Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met or Leu core with an Arg-X extension that is equally necessary and sufficient for kappa.",Brain research,1995

The biologic activity of this Ab-defined cell surface molecule on lymphocytes has not been established. Therefore, in an effort to understand the function of the CD70 protein, a mAb defining the CD70 Ag was used to isolate by expression cloning the cDNA responsible for the CD70 molecule. The predicted protein product is a type II transmembrane protein. Bioassays demonstrated that the CD70 cDNA clone expressed in African green monkey kidney cells would induce the proliferation of PHA-costimulated T cells. Comparison with known sequences indicates identity with the CD27 ligand. Therefore the molecule defining the CD70 Ag is identical to the recently defined ligand for CD27.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1994

Specific activation of complement via innate recognition proteins or secreted antibody releases cleavage products that interact with a wide range of cell surface receptors found on myeloid, lymphoid and stromal cells. This intricate interaction among complement activation products and cell surface receptors provides a basis for the regulation of both B and T cell responses. This review highlights fundamental events, explaining how complement links innate and adaptive immunity as well as describing more recent studies on how this large family of proteins functions locally in peripheral lymph nodes to enhance B and T cell responses.",Nature immunology,2004
10814828,The coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor protein as a cell adhesion molecule in the developing mouse brain.,"In an attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying neuro-network formation in the developing brain, we analyzed 130 proteolytic cleavage peptides of membrane proteins purified from newborn mouse brains. We describe here the characterization of a membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of which the cDNA sequence was recently reported, encoding the mouse homologue of the human coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (mCAR). Western and Northern blot analyses demonstrated the abundant expression of mCAR in the mouse brain, the highest level being observed in the newborn mouse brain, and its expression was detected in embryos as early as at 10. 5 days post-coitus (dpc), but decreased rapidly after birth. On in situ hybridization, mCAR mRNA expression was observed throughout the newborn mouse brain. In primary neurons from the hippocampi of mouse embryos the expression of mCAR was observed throughout the cells including those in growth cones on immunohistochemistry. In order to determine whether or not mCAR is involved in cell adhesion, aggregation assays were carried out. C6 cells transfected with mCAR cDNA aggregated homophilically, which was inhibited by specific antibodies against the extracellular domain of mCAR. In addition to its action as a virus receptor, mCAR may function naturally as an adhesion molecule involved in neuro-network formation in the developing nervous system.",Brain research.

14730967,The crystal structure of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 reveals novel features of the FGF family and offers a structural basis for its unusual receptor affinity.,"The 22 members of the FGF family have been implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration. They are required for both development and maintenance of vertebrates, demonstrating an exquisite pattern of affinities for both protein and proteoglycan receptors. FGF19, one of the most divergent human FGFs, is unique in binding solely to one receptor, FGFR4. We have used molecular replacement to solve the crystal structure of FGF19 at 1.3 A resolution using five superimposed FGF structures as the search model. The structure shows that two novel disulfide bonds found in FGF19, one of which appears to be conserved among several of the other FGFs, stabilize extended loops. The key heparin-binding loops of FGF19 have radically different conformations and charge patterns, compared to other FGFs, correlating with the unusually low affinity of FGF19 for heparin. A model for the complex of FGF19 with FGFR4 demonstrates that unique sequences in both FGF19 and FGFR4 are key to the formation of the complex. The structure therefore offers a clear explanation for the unusual affinity of FGF19 for FGFR4 alone.",,
14684734,The crystal structure of placental growth factor in complex with domain 2 of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1.,"Placental growth factor (PlGF) is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and plays an important role in pathological angiogenic events. PlGF exerts its biological activities through binding to VEGFR1, a receptor tyrosine kinase that consists of seven immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular portion. Here we report the crystal structure of PlGF bound to the second immunoglobulin-like domain of VEGFR1 at 2.5 A resolution and compare the complex to the closely related structure of VEGF bound to the same receptor domain. The two growth factors, PlGF and VEGF, share a sequence identity of approximately 50%. Despite this moderate sequence conservation, they bind to the same binding interface of VEGFR1 in a very similar fashion, suggesting that both growth factors could induce very similar if not identical signaling events.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2004
11263668,The crystal structure of the BMP-2:BMPR-IA complex and the generation of BMP-2 antagonists.,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) belong to the large transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. Signaling of the BMPs requires the binding of the BMP to the BMP cell surface receptors BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, and BMPR-II. Similar to other cytokines, members of the TGF-beta superfamily exhibit stringent specificity in their ligand-receptor interactions, which may be a reason for the qualitative and quantitative differences in cellular responses. To understand how BMPs and GDFs activate their receptors, it is important to determine structure and binding mechanisms of ligand-receptor complexes. We have used BMP-2 as a key representative of the BMPs to identify the epitopes for type I and type II receptor binding by mutational interaction analyses and have solved the crystal structure of a BMP2:BMPR-IA receptor ectodomain complex.",,
8752281,The CXC chemokine SDF-1 is the ligand for LESTR/fusin and prevents infection by T-cell-line-adapted HIV-1.,"A putative chemokine receptor that we previously cloned and termed LESTR has recently been shown to function as a co-receptor (termed fusin) for lymphocyte-tropic HIV-1 strains. Cells expressing CD4 became permissive to infection with T-cell-line-adapted HIV-1 strains of the syncytium-inducing phenotype after transfection with LESTR/fusin complementary DNA. We report here the indentification of a human chemokine of the CXC type, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), as the natural ligand for LESTR/fusin, and we propose the term CXCR-4 for this receptor, in keeping with the new chemokine-receptor nomenclature. SDF-1 activates Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with CXCR-4 cDNA as well as blood leukocytes and lymphocytes. In cell lines expressing CXCR-4 and CD4, and in blood lymphocytes, SDF-1 is a powerful inhibitor of infection by lymphocyte-tropic HIV-1 strains, whereas the CC chemokines RANTES, MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta, which were shown previously to prevent infection with primary, monocyte-tropic viruses, are inactive. In combination with CC chemokines, which block the infection with monocyte/macrophage-tropic viruses, SDF-1 could help to decrease virus load and prevent the emergence of the syncytium-inducing viruses which are characteristic of the late stages of AIDS.",,

By measuring calcium flux in human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with plasmids encoding IL8RA or IL8RB, we have now defined receptor selectivity for GRObeta, GROgamma, and ENA-78. The rank order of agonist potency, based on inspection of the mean effective concentration values (EC50), for IL8RB was GROgamma (1 nM) > IL-8 (4 nM) approximately GROalpha (5 nM) approximately GRObeta (4 nM) approximately NAP-2 (7 nM) > ENA-78 (11 nM), and for IL8RA was IL-8 (4 nM) >>> ENA-78 (40 nM) approximately NAP-2 (45 nM) > GROalpha (63 nM) approximately GROgamma (65 nM) >> GRObeta. The maximal response of IL8RA to IL-8 was at least 2-fold greater than the other five chemokines. All six agonists for IL8RB competed for high affinity 125I-IL-8, -GROalpha, -NAP-2, and -ENA-78 binding sites at IL8RB. GROalpha, GRObeta, GROgamma, NAP-2, and ENA-78 competed weakly for the high affinity IL-8 binding site at IL8RA. Thus, IL8RA and IL8RB are both highly selective for IL-8 and have similar sequences but differ dramatically in their selectivity for all other ELR+ CXC chemokines tested. These findings have important implications for developing novel neutrophil-specific anti-inflammatory drugs directed against the CXC chemokine signaling system.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
15946947,The CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors form constitutive homo- and heterodimers selectively and with equal apparent affinities.,"Both homo- and heterodimeric interactions between the CXCR1 and CXCR2 chemokine receptors were observed following co-expression of forms of these receptors in HEK293 cells using assays, including co-immunoprecipitation, single cell imaging of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, cell surface time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. These interactions were constitutive and unaffected by the presence of the agonist interleukin 8 and selective as no significant interactions were noted between either the CXCR1 or CXCR2 receptor and the alpha(1A)-adrenoreceptor. Saturation bioluminescence resonance energy transfer indicated that heteromeric interactions between CXCR1 and CXCR2 were of similar affinity as the corresponding homomeric interactions. A novel endoplasmic reticulum trapping strategy demonstrated that these interactions were initiated during protein synthesis and maturation and prior to cell surface delivery. These studies indicated that CXCR1-CXCR2 heterodimers are as likely to form in cells co-expressing these two chemokine receptors as the corresponding homodimers and stand in contrast to previous studies indicating an inability of the CXCR1 receptor to homodimerize or to interact with the CXCR2 receptor (Trettel, F., Di Bartolomeo, S., Lauro, C., Catalano, M., Ciotti, M. T., and Limatola, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 40980-40988).",,

9211889,The cytoplasmic domain of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor alpha subunit is essential for both GM-CSF-mediated growth and differentiation.,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) regulates differentiation, survival, and proliferation of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells. The biologic actions of GM-CSF are mediated by binding to a specific receptor consisting of two chains designated as alpha and beta subunits. We have demonstrated that the murine FDC-P1-derived cell line WT-19 transfected with the human GM-CSF receptor alpha and beta subunits (GM-CSFRalpha and beta) can be induced to differentiate by the addition of human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF). By expressing a series of GM-CSFRalpha mutants in WT19 cells, we have determined the amino acid domains of the GM-CSFRalpha cytoplasmic domain that regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. We found that the membrane proximal proline-rich domain and adjacent 16 residues are essential for both hGM-CSF-dependent cell proliferation and differentiation. In contrast, the C-terminal region of the GM-CSFRalpha cytoplasmic domain was not necessary for cell differentiation mediated by hGM-CSF, but the removal of this region severely impaired the ability of hGM-CSF to support cell survival. While the activation of JAK2, Shc, Erk, and STAT5 proteins correlated with hGM-CSF-mediated cell growth, cellular differentiation occurred in the absence of activation of these signal transduction pathways.",,
27430624,The Dentin Sialoprotein (DSP) Domain Regulates Dental Mesenchymal Cell Differentiation through a Novel Surface Receptor.,"Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is a dentin extracellular matrix protein that is processed into dentin sialoprotein (DSP), dentin glycoprotein (DGP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP). DSP is mainly expressed in odontoblasts. We hypothesized that DSP interacts with cell surface receptors and subsequently activates intracellular signaling. Using DSP as bait for screening a protein library, we demonstrate that DSP acts as a ligand and binds to integrin β6. The 36 amino acid residues of DSP are sufficient to bind to integrin β6. This peptide promoted cell attachment, migration, differentiation and mineralization of dental mesenchymal cells. In addition, DSP (aa183-219) stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P38 kinases. This activation was inhibited by an anti-integrin β6 antibody and siRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this DSP fragment induces SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation via ERK1/2 and P38 signaling. SMAD1/5/8 binds to SMAD binding elements (SBEs) in the DSPP gene promoter. SBE mutations result in a decrease in DSPP transcriptional activity. Endogenous DSPP expression was up-regulated by DSP (aa183-219) in dental mesenchymal cells. The data in the current study demonstrate for the first time that this DSP domain acts as a ligand in a RGD-independent manner and is involved in intracellular signaling via interacting with integrin β6. The DSP domain regulates DSPP expression and odontoblast homeostasis via a positive feedback loop.",Scientific reports,2016
9659899,The discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinases are activated by collagen.,"Two mammalian receptor tyrosine kinases (DDR1 and DDR2) have extracellular domains closely related to a D. discoideum lectin, discoidin, required for cell aggregation. Here, we show that the mammalian DDR receptors bind and are activated by specific types of collagen. Stimulation of DDR receptor tyrosine kinase activity requires the native triple-helical structure of collagen and occurs over an extended period of time. Collagen activation of DDR1 induces phosphorylation of a docking site for the Shc phosphotyrosine binding domain, whose presence is controlled by alternative splicing. Activation of DDR2 by collagen results in the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression. These results suggest that the discoidin-related DDR tyrosine kinases are novel collagen receptors with the potential to control cellular responses to the extracellular matrix.",,
15361064,The disintegrin domain of ADAM9: a ligand for multiple beta1 renal integrins.,"Renal tubular epithelial cells in all nephron segments express a distinct member of the metalloprotease-disintegrin family, ADAM9 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 9), in a punctate basolateral distribution co-localized to the beta1 integrin chain [Mahimkar, Baricos, Visaya, Pollock and Lovett (2000) J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 11, 595-603]. Discrete segments of the nephron express several defined beta1 integrins, suggesting that ADAM9 interacts with multiple renal integrins and thereby regulates epithelial cell-matrix interactions. Intact ADAM9 and a series of deletion constructs sequentially lacking the metalloprotease domain and the disintegrin domain were assembled as chimaeras with a C-terminal GFP (green fluorescent protein) tag. Stable expression of the ADAM9/GFP protein on the surface of HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) significantly decreased adhesion to types I and IV collagen, vitronectin and laminin, but had little effect on adhesion to fibronectin. Expression of the disintegrin/cysteine-rich/GFP construct yielded a similar, but more marked pattern of decreased adhesion. Expression of the cysteine-rich/GFP construct had no effect on adhesion, indicating that the disintegrin domain was responsible for the competitive inhibition of cell-matrix binding. To define the specific renal tubular beta1 integrins interacting with the ADAM9 disintegrin domain, a recombinant GST (glutathione S-transferase)-disintegrin protein was used as a substrate in adhesion assays in the presence or absence of specific integrin-blocking antibodies. Inclusion of antibodies to alpha1, alpha3, alpha6, alphav and beta1 blocked adhesion of HEK-293 cells to GST-disintegrin protein. Immobilized GST-disintegrin domain perfused with renal cortical lysates specifically recovered the alpha3, alpha6, alphav and beta1 integrin chains by Western analysis. It is concluded that ADAM9 is a polyvalent ligand, through its disintegrin domain, for multiple renal integrins of the beta1 class.",The Biochemical journal,2005
8641360,"The Dtk receptor tyrosine kinase, which binds protein S, is expressed during hematopoiesis.","Dtk (Tyro 3/Sky/Rse/Brt/Tif) belongs to a recently recognized subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that also includes Ufo (Axl/Ark) and Mer (Eyk). Ligands for Dtk and Ufo have been identified as protein S and the related molecule Gas6, respectively. This study examined expression of Dtk during ontogeny of the hematopoietic system and compared the pattern of expression with that of Ufo. Both receptors were abundantly expressed in differentiating embryonic stem cells, yolk sac blood islands, para-aortic splanchnopleural mesoderm, fractionated AA4+ fetal liver cells, and fetal thymus from day 14 until birth. Although Ufo was expressed at moderate levels in adult bone marrow, expression of Dtk in this tissue was barely detectable. In adult bone marrow subpopulations fractionated using counterflow centrifugal elutriation, immunomagnetic bead selection for lineage-depletion and FACS sorting for c-kit expression, very low levels of Dtk and/or Ufo were detected in some cell fractions. These results suggest that Dtk and Ufo are likely to be involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, particularly during the embryonic stages of blood cell development.",Experimental hematology,1996
19443639,The E-selectin ligand basigin/CD147 is responsible for neutrophil recruitment in renal ischemia/reperfusion.,"E-selectin and its ligands are essential for extravasation of leukocytes in inflammation. Here, we report that basigin (Bsg)/CD147 is a ligand for E-selectin that promotes renal inflammation in ischemia/reperfusion. Compared with wild-type mice, Bsg-deficient (Bsg(-/-)) mice demonstrated striking suppression of neutrophil infiltration in the kidney after renal ischemia/reperfusion. Although E-selectin expression increased similarly between the two genotypes, Bsg(-/-) mice exhibited less renal damage, suggesting that Bsg on neutrophils contribute to renal injury in this model. Neutrophils expressed Bsg with N-linked polylactosamine chains and Bsg(-)(/)(-) neutrophils showed reduced binding to E-selectin. Bsg isolated from HL-60 cells bound to E-selectin, and tunicamycin treatment to abolish N-linked glycans from Bsg abrogated this binding. Furthermore, Bsg(-)(/)(-) neutrophils exhibited reduced E-selectin-dependent adherence to human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. Injection of labeled neutrophils into mice showed that Bsg(-)(/)(-) neutrophils were less readily recruited to the kidney after renal ischemia/reperfusion than Bsg(+/+) neutrophils, regardless of the recipient's genotype. Taken together, these results indicate that Bsg is a physiologic ligand for E-selectin that plays a critical role in the renal damage induced by ischemia/reperfusion.",,
21419176,The EGF-like proteins DLK1 and DLK2 function as inhibitory non-canonical ligands of NOTCH1 receptor that modulate each other's activities.,"The protein DLK2, highly homologous to DLK1, belongs to the EGF-like family of membrane proteins, which includes NOTCH receptors and their DSL-ligands. The molecular mechanisms by which DLK proteins regulate cell differentiation and proliferation processes are not fully established yet. In previous reports, we demonstrated that DLK1 interacts with itself and with specific EGF-like repeats of the NOTCH1 extracellular region involved in the binding to NOTCH1 canonical ligands. Moreover, the interaction of DLK1 with NOTCH1 caused an inhibition of basal NOTCH signaling in preadipocytes and mesenchymal multipotent cells. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, that DLK2 interacts with itself, with DLK1, and with the same NOTCH1 receptor region as DLK1 does. We demonstrate also that the interaction of DLK2 with NOTCH1 similarly results in an inhibition of NOTCH signaling in preadipocytes and Mouse Embryo fibloblasts. In addition, we demonstrate that a membrane DLK1 variant, lacking the sequence recognized by the protease TACE, also inhibits NOTCH signaling. Furthermore, both DLK1 and DLK2 are able to decrease NOTCH activity also when triggered by specific NOTCH ligands. However, the decrease in NOTCH signaling induced by overexpression of Dlk2 is reversed by the overexpression of Dlk1, and viceversa. We conclude that DLK1 and DLK2 act as inhibitory non-canonical protein ligands for the NOTCH1 receptor that modulate NOTCH signaling.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,2011
11839764,The EIIIA segment of fibronectin is a ligand for integrins alpha 9beta 1 and alpha 4beta 1 providing a novel mechanism for regulating cell adhesion by alternative splicing.,"Alternative splicing of the fibronectin gene transcript gives rise to forms that include the EIIIA (or ED-A) segment. EIIIA-containing fibronectins are prominently expressed during embryogenesis and wound healing and appear to mediate changes in cell adhesion and gene expression. Nonetheless, integrins that bind the EIIIA segment have not been identified. We previously mapped the epitope for two function-blocking monoclonal antibodies to the C-C' loop region of the EIIIA segment (Liao, Y.-F., Wieder, K. G., Classen, J. M., and Van De Water, L. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 17876-17884). The sequence of this epitope ((39)PEDGIHELFP(48)) resembles the sequence within tenascin-C to which the integrin alpha(9)beta(1) binds. We now report that either integrin alpha(9)beta(1) or alpha(4)beta(1) can mediate cell adhesion to the EIIIA segment. Moreover, this interaction is blocked both by epitope-mapped EIIIA antibodies as well as by the respective anti-integrins. Deletion mutants of the EIIIA segment that include the C-C' loop and flanking sequence bind cells expressing either alpha(9)beta(1) or alpha(4)beta(1). Adhesion of alpha(4)beta(1)-containing MOLT-3 cells to the EIIIA segment stimulates phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase. Our observation that two integrins bind the EIIIA segment establishes a novel mechanism by which cell adhesion to fibronectin is regulated by alternative splicing.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002

NGAL binds bacterial siderophores preventing bacteria from retrieving iron from this source. Also, NGAL may be important in delivering iron to cells during formation of the tubular epithelial cells of the primordial kidney. No cellular receptor for NGAL has been described. We show here that megalin, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family expressed in polarized epithelia, binds NGAL with high affinity, as shown by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Furthermore, a rat yolk sac cell line known to express high levels of megalin, endocytosed NGAL by a mechanism completely blocked by an antibody against megalin.",FEBS letters,2005
12527360,The enzymatic activity of phosphoglucose isomerase is not required for its cytokine function.,"PGI is a housekeeping gene encoding phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) a glycolytic enzyme that also functions as a cytokine (autocrine motility factor (AMF)/neuroleukin/maturation factor) upon secretion from the cell and binding to its 78 kDa seven-transmembrane domain receptor (gp78/AMF-R). PGI contains a CXXC motif, characteristic of redox proteins and possibly evolutionarily related to the CC and CXC motif of the chemokine gene family. Using site-directed mutagenesis, single- and double-deletion (CXC, CC) mutants were created by deleting amino acids 331 and 332 of human PGI, respectively. The mutant proteins lost their enzymatic activity; however, neither of the deletions augmented the proteins' binding affinity to the receptor and all maintained cytokine function. The results demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of PGI is not essential for either receptor binding or cytokine function of human PGI.",FEBS letters,2003
9330863,The Eph family of receptors.,"Eph receptor tyrosine kinases have recently been identified as instructive molecules that guide the topographic movement of cells and growth cones. The activation of Eph receptors by their ligands, which are membrane-anchored molecules, involves a cell-cell recognition event that often causes cell repulsion. Therefore, Eph receptors mediate signals that can override cell adhesion. Transmembrane ligands for Eph receptors also exhibit properties of signal transducing molecules, suggesting that bidirectional signaling occurs when receptor-expressing cells contact ligand-expressing cells.",Current opinion in cell biology,1997
11416136,The EphA8 receptor regulates integrin activity through p110gamma phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase in a tyrosine kinase activity-independent manner.,"Recent genetic studies suggest that ephrins may function in a kinase-independent Eph receptor pathway. Here we report that expression of EphA8 in either NIH 3T3 or HEK293 cells enhanced cell adhesion to fibronectin via alpha(5)beta(1)- or beta(3) integrins. Interestingly, a kinase-inactive EphA8 mutant also markedly promoted cell attachment to fibronectin in these cell lines. Using a panel of EphA8 point mutants, we have demonstrated that EphA8 kinase activity does not correlate with its ability to promote cell attachment to fibronectin. Analysis using EphA8 extracellular and intracellular domain mutants has revealed that enhanced cell adhesion is dependent on ephrin A binding to the extracellular domain and the juxtamembrane segment of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. EphA8-promoted adhesion was efficiently inhibited by wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor. Additionally, we found that EphA8 had associated PI 3-kinase activity and that the p110gamma isoform of PI 3-kinase is associated with EphA8. In vitro binding experiments revealed that the EphA8 juxtamembrane segment was sufficient for the formation of a stable complex with p110gamma. Similar results were obtained in assay using cells stripped of endogenous ephrin A ligands by treatment with preclustered ephrin A5-Fc proteins. In addition, a membrane-targeted lipid kinase-inactive p110gamma mutant was demonstrated to stably associate with EphA8 and suppress EphA8-promoted cell adhesion to fibronectin. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of a novel mechanism by which the EphA8 receptor localizes p110gamma PI 3-kinase to the plasma membrane in a tyrosine kinase-independent fashion, thereby allowing access to lipid substrates to enable the signals required for integrin-mediated cell adhesion.",Molecular and cellular biology,2001
8702723,"The epidermal growth factor receptor couples transforming growth factor-alpha, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like factor, and amphiregulin to Neu, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4.","The epidermal growth factor (EGF) family hormones amphiregulin (AR), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) are thought to play significant roles in the genesis or progression of a number of human malignancies. However, the ability of these ligands to activate all four erbB family receptors has not been evaluated. Therefore, we have assessed the stimulation of erbB family receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by these hormones in a panel of mouse Ba/F3 cell lines expressing the four erbB family receptors, singly and in pairwise combinations. We also measured the stimulation of interleukin-3-independent survival or proliferation in this panel of Ba/F3 cell lines to compare the patterns of erbB family receptor coupling to physiologic responses induced by these peptides. EGF, TGF-alpha, AR, and HB-EGF all stimulated qualitatively similar patterns of erbB family receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and coupling to physiologic responses. Therefore, EGF, TGF-alpha, AR, and HB-EGF are functionally identical in this model system and behave differently from the EGF family hormones betacellulin and neuregulins.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
7595520,The F3 neuronal glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked molecule is localized to glycolipid-enriched membrane subdomains and interacts with L1 and fyn kinase in cerebellum.,"The F3 molecule is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily anchored to plasma membranes by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol group. In adult mouse cerebellum, F3 is predominantly expressed on a subset of axons, the parallel fibers, and at their synapses. In vitro studies established that it is a plurifunctional molecule that, depending on the cellular context and the ligand with which it interacts, either mediates repulsive interactions or promotes neurite outgrowth. In the present study, we report the isolation of two fractions of F3-containing microdomains from adult cerebellum on the basis of their resistance to solubilization by Triton X-100 at 4 degrees C. Both fractions were composed of vesicles, ranging from 100 to 200 nm in diameter. Lipid composition analysis indicated that the lighter fraction was enriched in cerebrosides and sulfatides. F3 sensitivity to phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C differed between the two fractions, possibly reflecting structural differences in the lipid anchor of the F3 molecule. Both fractions were highly enriched in other glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins such as NCAM 120 and Thy-1. It is interesting that these vesicles were devoid of the transmembrane forms (NCAM 180 and NCAM 140), which were recovered in Triton X-100-soluble fractions, but contained the L1 transmembrane adhesion molecule that is coexpressed with F3 on parallel fibers and the fyn tyrosine kinase. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that F3, but not NCAM 120 or Thy-1, was physically associated in a complex with both L1 and fyn tyrosine kinase. This strongly suggests that the interaction between L1 and F3, already described to occur with isolated molecules, is present in neural tissue. More important is that our study provides information on the molecular machinery likely to be involved in F3 signaling.",Journal of neurochemistry,1995
19920134,"The FGFRL1 receptor is shed from cell membranes, binds fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), and antagonizes FGF signaling in Xenopus embryos.","FGFRL1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor like 1) is the fifth and most recently discovered member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family. With up to 50% amino acid similarity, its extracellular domain closely resembles that of the four conventional FGFRs. Its intracellular domain, however, lacks the split tyrosine kinase domain needed for FGF-mediated signal transduction. During embryogenesis of the mouse, FGFRL1 is essential for the development of parts of the skeleton, the diaphragm muscle, the heart, and the metanephric kidney. Since its discovery, it has been hypothesized that FGFRL1 might act as a decoy receptor for FGF ligands. Here we present several lines of evidence that support this notion. We demonstrate that the FGFRL1 ectodomain is shed from the cell membrane of differentiating C2C12 myoblasts and from HEK293 cells by an as yet unidentified protease, which cuts the receptor in the membrane-proximal region. As determined by ligand dot blot analysis, cell-based binding assays, and surface plasmon resonance analysis, the soluble FGFRL1 ectodomain as well as the membrane-bound receptor are capable of binding to some FGF ligands with high affinity, including FGF2, FGF3, FGF4, FGF8, FGF10, and FGF22. We furthermore show that ectopic expression of FGFRL1 in Xenopus embryos antagonizes FGFR signaling during early development. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that FGFRL1 is indeed a decoy receptor for FGFs.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2010
8392057,The fifth transmembrane segment of the neuromedin B receptor is critical for high affinity neuromedin B binding.,"The two bombesin receptor subtypes, neuromedin B (NMB-R) and gastrin releasing peptide (GRP-R) receptors, bind their respective ligands with high affinity. To identify molecular components mediating high affinity NMB binding, four mutant receptors were constructed, in which different parts of the NMB-R were replaced with the corresponding regions of the GRP-R. When stably expressed in Balb 3T3 fibroblasts, all four NMB-R/GRP-R chimeras were functional and showed NMB-induced stimulation of inositol phosphate (IP) formation. Results of 125I-[D-Tyr0]NMB displacement assays using unlabeled NMB for competition indicated that high affinity NMB binding was determined by amino acid sequences in transmembrane domain V (TM-V) of the NMB-R. To identify which amino acid(s) in TM-V of NMB-R contributed to high affinity NMB binding, four additional NMB-R mutants were constructed where non-conserved amino acids in TM-V of NMB-R were replaced by the corresponding GRP-R amino acids. Three of the mutations, TyrPheLeu220-222-->PheTyrVal, Ile230-->Val, and His234-->Phe, did not affect high affinity NMB binding. The Ile216-->Ser substitution, however, abolished high affinity NMB binding and severely impaired the ability of the mutant receptor to stimulate NMB-dependent inositol phosphate formation. These results suggest that ILe216 in TM-V of NMB-R may be critical for high affinity NMB binding.",,
10662798,"The first alpha helix of interleukin (IL)-2 folds as a homotetramer, acts as an agonist of the IL-2 receptor beta chain, and induces lymphokine-activated killer cells.","Interleukin (IL)-2 interacts with two types of functional receptors (IL-2Ralphabetagamma and IL-2Rbetagamma) and acts on a broad range of target cells involved in inflammatory reactions and immune responses. For the first time, we show that a chemically synthesized fragment of the IL-2 sequence can fold into a molecule mimicking the quaternary structure of a hemopoietin. Indeed, peptide p1-30 (containing amino acids 1-30, covering the entire alpha helix A of IL-2) spontaneously folds into an alpha-helical homotetramer and stimulates the growth of T cell lines expressing human IL-2Rbeta, whereas shorter versions of the peptide lack helical structure and are inactive. We also demonstrate that this neocytokine interacts with a previously undescribed dimeric form of IL-2Rbeta. In agreement with its binding to IL-2Rbeta, p1-30 activates Shc and p56(lck) but unlike IL-2, fails to activate Janus kinase (Jak)1, Jak3, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). Unexpectedly, we also show that p1-30 activates Tyk2, thus suggesting that IL-2Rbeta may bind to different Jaks depending on its oligomerization. At the cellular level, p1-30 induces lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and preferentially activates CD8(low) lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which constitutively express IL-2Rbeta. A significant interferon gamma production is also detected after p1-30 stimulation. A mutant form of p1-30 (Asp20-->Lys), which is likely unable to induce vascular leak syndrome, remains capable of generating LAK cells, like the original p1-30 peptide. Altogether, our data suggest that p1-30 has therapeutic potential.",,
11327878,The first epidermal growth factor-like domain of the low-density lipoprotein receptor contains a noncanonical calcium binding site.,"Removal of cholesterol-containing particles from the circulation is mediated by the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. Upon ligand binding, the receptor-ligand complex is endocytosed, and the ligand is released. The important biological role of the LDL receptor (LDLR) has been highlighted by the identification of more than 400 LDLR mutations that are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia. The extracellular region of the LDLR is modular in nature and principally comprises multiple copies of ligand binding, epidermal growth factor-like (EGF), and YWTD-type domains. This report describes characterization of the calcium binding properties of the tandem pair of EGF domains. While only the C-terminal EGF module contains the consensus sequence associated with calcium binding, a noncanonical calcium binding site in the N-terminal domain has been revealed using solution NMR spectroscopy. The calcium dissociation constants for the N- and C-terminal sites have been measured under physiologically relevant pH and ionic strength conditions using a combination of solution NMR, intrinsic protein fluorescence, and chromophoric chelator methods to be approximately 50 microM and approximately 10-20 microM, respectively. Identification of the novel calcium binding motif in LDLR sequences from other species suggests that it may confer specificity within the LDLR gene family. Comparison of the K(d) for the C-terminal site with the calcium concentration in late vesicles indicates that the binding properties of this module may be tuned to titrate upon endocytosis of the LDL receptor-ligand complex, and thus calcium binding may play a role in the ligand dissociation process.",Biochemistry,2001
12529173,"The Fn14 cytoplasmic tail binds tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factors 1, 2, 3 and 5 and mediates nuclear factor-kappaB activation.","Fn14 is a growth-factor-inducible immediate-early-response gene encoding a 102-amino-acid type I transmembrane protein. The human Fn14 protein was recently identified as a cell-surface receptor for the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member named TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis). In the present paper, we report that the human TWEAK extracellular domain can also bind the murine Fn14 protein. Furthermore, site-specific mutagenesis and directed yeast two-hybrid interaction assays revealed that the TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) 1, 2, 3 and 5 adaptor molecules bind the murine Fn14 cytoplasmic tail at an overlapping, but non-identical, amino acid sequence motif. We also found that TWEAK treatment of quiescent NIH 3T3 cells stimulates inhibitory kappaBalpha phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) enhancer/luciferase reporter construct. Fn14 overexpression in transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells also promotes NF-kappaB activation, and this cellular response requires an intact TRAF binding site. These results indicate that Fn14 is a functional TWEAK receptor that can associate with four distinct TRAF family members and stimulate the NF-kappaB transcription factor signalling pathway.",The Biochemical journal,2003
10958799,The G protein-coupled receptor CL1 interacts directly with proteins of the Shank family.,"PDZ domains play a pivotal role in the synaptic localization of ion channels, receptors, signaling enzymes, and cell adhesion molecules. These domains mediate protein-protein interactions via the recognition of a conserved sequence motif at the extreme C terminus of their target proteins. By means of a yeast two-hybrid screen using the C terminus of the G protein-coupled alpha-latrotoxin receptor CL1 as bait, three PDZ domain proteins of the Shank family were identified. These proteins belong to a single protein family characterized by a common domain organization. The PDZ domain is highly conserved among the family members, significantly different from other known PDZ domains, and specifically binds to the C terminus of CL1. Shank1 and CL1 are expressed primarily in brain, and both proteins co-enrich in the postsynaptic density. Furthermore, Shank1 induces a clustering of CL1 in transfected cells, strongly supporting an interaction of both proteins in vivo.",,
18165312,The genetic design of signaling cascades to record receptor activation.,"We have developed an experimental strategy to monitor protein interactions in a cell with a high degree of selectivity and sensitivity. A transcription factor is tethered to a membrane-bound receptor with a linker that contains a cleavage site for a specific protease. Activation of the receptor recruits a signaling protein fused to the protease that then cleaves and releases the transcription factor to activate reporter genes in the nucleus. This strategy converts a transient interaction into a stable and amplifiable reporter gene signal to record the activation of a receptor without interference from endogenous signaling pathways. We have developed this assay for three classes of receptors: G protein-coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, and steroid hormone receptors.

We report that PGRN bound directly to tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs) and disturbed the TNFα-TNFR interaction. PGRN-deficient mice were susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis, and administration of PGRN reversed inflammatory arthritis. Atsttrin, an engineered protein composed of three PGRN fragments, exhibited selective TNFR binding. PGRN and Atsttrin prevented inflammation in multiple arthritis mouse models and inhibited TNFα-activated intracellular signaling. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PGRN is a ligand of TNFR, an antagonist of TNFα signaling, and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis in mice. They also suggest new potential therapeutic interventions for various TNFα-mediated pathologies and conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis.",,
11786020,The high-affinity interaction of human IL-4 and the receptor alpha chain is constituted by two independent binding clusters.,"IL4-BP, the extracellular binding domain of the IL-4 receptor alpha chain, contains a high-affinity binding epitope for IL-4 (K(D) 150 pM). Previous results on the crystal structure of the IL-4/IL4-BP complex and on the functional epitope of IL-4 suggested that this contact comprises a mosaic of two binding clusters. The present mutational analysis of IL4-BP supports this view and demonstrates that the energetically most important group is the receptor carboxylate group of D72 forming an ion pair with IL-4 R88 in cluster II. The second main receptor determinant is the hydroxyl group of Y183 forming a hydrogen bond with IL-4 E9 in cluster I. The latter is engaged in additional hydrogen bonds with Y13 and also in van der Waals contacts with Y127. Receptor residue D72 as well as Y183 are each surrounded by a shell of hydrophobic groups from residues that upon mutation lead to smaller decreases in binding affinity. Analysis of IL4-BP double mutants showed that receptor side-chains within one cluster but not those of different clusters cooperate. Interaction analysis of IL-4 and IL4-BP single mutants also revealed additivity in binding of side-chains between clusters and cooperativity within each cluster I or II.These results show that the high-affinity IL-4/IL4-BP contact is constituted by two independent binding units, each containing a central polar or charged side-chain surrounded by hydrophobic groups (avocado cluster).",Journal of molecular biology,2002
7681836,The human brain cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor. Cloning and characterization.,"The predominant brain cholecystokinin receptor (CCK-B/gastrin) has been implicated in mediating many of the central effects of cholecystokinin, including anxiety, panic attacks, satiety, and analgesia, suggesting it is an important pharmacologic target. We now report the cloning and characterization of the cDNA encoding the human brain CCK-B/gastrin receptor. The cDNA was isolated from a human brain library by low stringency screening using the canine ""gastrin"" receptor cDNA as a hybridization probe. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame encoding a 447-amino-acid protein with seven putative hydrophobic transmembrane domains and significant homology with other known members of the gastrin/cholecystokinin receptor family. Agonist and antagonist affinities of the recombinant human brain receptor expressed in COS-7 cells are consistent with a classical ""CCK-B"" receptor as defined by the literature. In COS-7 cells expressing the cloned receptor, CCK-8-stimulated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization suggesting second messenger signaling through phospholipase C. CCK-B/gastrin receptor transcripts were identified in human brain, stomach, and pancreas using high stringency Northern blot analysis. Southern blot hybridization analysis of human genomic DNA indicates that a single gene encodes both the brain and the stomach CCK-B/gastrin receptors. Our data suggest that the CCK-B and gastrin receptors are identical and that the long standing distinction between them may no longer apply.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1993
14642436,"The human frizzled-3 (FZD3) gene on chromosome 8p21, a receptor gene for Wnt ligands, is associated with the susceptibility to schizophrenia.","Neurodevelopmental abnormalities have been reported in studies on the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The Wnt-signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of processes in neurodevelopment, and the frizzled proteins have been identified as receptors for Wnt ligands. Of the frizzled proteins, frizzled-3 (FZD3) is required for formation of the neural crest and for development of major fiber tracts in the CNS. The human FZD3 gene is located on chromosome 8p21, a positive linkage locus for schizophrenia. We analyzed polymorphisms of the FZD3 gene in patients with schizophrenia and control subjects in the Japanese population. We found a significant association between schizophrenia and the FZD3 gene in single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype analyses. Our data suggest that dysregulation of the Wnt-signaling pathway may be involved in the susceptibility to schizophrenia.",Neuroscience letters,2003

18684971,The human IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimeric cytokine signals through the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex.,"IL-17A and IL-17F, produced by the Th17 CD4(+) T cell lineage, have been linked to a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. We recently reported that activated human CD4(+) T cells produce not only IL-17A and IL-17F homodimers but also an IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimeric cytokine. All three cytokines can induce chemokine secretion from bronchial epithelial cells, albeit with different potencies. In this study, we used small interfering RNA and Abs to IL-17RA and IL-17RC to demonstrate that heterodimeric IL-17F/IL-17A cytokine activity is dependent on the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex. Interestingly, surface plasmon resonance studies indicate that the three cytokines bind to IL-17RC with comparable affinities, whereas they bind to IL-17RA with different affinities. Thus, we evaluated the effect of the soluble receptors on cytokine activity and we find that soluble receptors exhibit preferential cytokine blockade. IL-17A activity is inhibited by IL-17RA, IL-17F is inhibited by IL-17RC, and a combination of soluble IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptors is required for inhibition of the IL-17F/IL-17A activity. Altogether, these results indicate that human IL-17F/IL-17A cytokine can bind and signal through the same receptor complex as human IL-17F and IL-17A. However, the distinct affinities of the receptor components for IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer can be exploited to differentially affect the activity of these cytokines.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2008
7559467,"The human integrin alpha 8 beta 1 functions as a receptor for tenascin, fibronectin, and vitronectin.","The integrin family of adhesion receptors consists of at least 21 heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that differ in their tissue distribution and ligand specificity. The recently identified alpha 8 integrin subunit associates with beta 1 and is predominantly expressed in smooth muscle and other contractile cells in adult tissues, and in mesenchymal and neural cells during development. We now show that alpha 8 beta 1 specifically localizes to focal contacts in cells plated on the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin or vitronectin. In addition we show that human embryonic kidney cells (293), transfected with alpha 8 cDNA, express alpha 8 beta 1 on their surface and use this receptor for adhesion to fibronectin and vitronectin. Furthermore, alpha 8 beta 1 binds to both fibronectin- and vitronectin-Sepharose and can be specifically eluted from either matrix protein by the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-containing peptide, GRGDSP. Because fibronectin and vitronectin adhesion appeared to be mediated by RGD, we examined additional RGD-containing proteins, including tenascin, fibrinogen, thrombospondin, osteopontin, and denatured collagen type I. We found that only tenascin was able to mediate adhesion of alpha 8-transfected 293 cells. By using recombinant fragments of tenascin in adhesion assays, we were able to localize the alpha 8 beta 1 binding domain of tenascin to the RGD-containing third fibronectin type III repeat. These data strongly suggest that tenascin, fibronectin, and vitronectin are ligands for alpha 8 beta 1 and that this integrin binds to the RGD site in each of these ligands through mechanisms that are distinct and separate from alpha 5- and alpha v-containing integrins.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1995
11888273,"The human interferon receptor: NMR-based modeling, mapping of the IFN-alpha 2 binding site, and observed ligand-induced tightening.","The human interferon receptor (IFNAR) mediates the antiviral and antiproliferative activities of type I interferons (IFNs). This receptor is comprised of subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, the latter exhibiting nanomolar affinity for IFNs. Here the extracellular domain of IFNAR2 (IFNAR2-EC), a soluble 25 kDa IFN-binding polypeptide, and its complex with IFN-alpha 2 were studied using multidimensional NMR. IFNAR2-EC is comprised of two fibronectin-III (FN-III) domains connected by a helical hinge region. The deduced global fold was utilized to improve the alignment of IFNAR2-EC against structurally related receptors and to model its structure. A striking feature of IFNAR2-EC is the limited and localized deviations in chemical shifts exhibited upon ligand binding, observed for only 15% of its backbone (1)H and (15)N nuclei. Analysis of these deviations maps the IFN-alpha 2 binding site upon IFNAR2-EC to a contiguous surface on the N-terminal domain, including the S3-S4 loop (residues 44-53), the S5-S6 loop and S6 beta-strand (residues 74-82), and the S7 beta-strand and the hinge region (residues 95-105). The C-terminal domain contributes only marginally to ligand binding, and no change in the hypothesized interdomain interface is observed. The proposed binding domain encompasses all residues implicated by mutagenesis studies in IFN binding, and suggests adjacent residues cooperate in forming the binding surface. D(2)O-exchange experiments indicate that binding of IFN-alpha2 induces tightening of the N-terminal domain of IFNAR2-EC. This increase in receptor rigidity may play an important role in initiating the intracellular stage of the IFN signaling cascade.",Biochemistry,2002
2970671,The human laminin receptor is a member of the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors.,"A receptor for the adhesive basement membrane protein, laminin, was isolated from human glioblastoma cells by affinity chromatography on laminin. This receptor has a heterodimeric structure similar to that of receptors for other extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and vitronectin. Incorporation of the laminin receptor into liposomal membranes makes it possible for liposomes to attach to surfaces coated with laminin. The receptor liposomes also attached to some extent to surfaces coated with fibronectin, but not with other matrix proteins. These properties identify the laminin receptor as a member of the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1988

(Honda, Z-I., Nakamura, M., Miki, I., Minami, M., Watanabe, T., Seyama, Y., Okado, H., Tok, H., Ito, K., Miyamato, T., and Shimizu, T. (1991) Nature 349, 342-346) as a receptor for platelet-activating factor (PAF). The cloned DNA confers high affinity binding sites for platelet-activating factor when transfected into COS-7 cells and has binding and desensitization properties similar to the human leukocyte receptor. Southern analysis using this cDNA indicates that the PAF receptor gene is present as a single copy in the human genome. The deduced protein sequence predicts seven hydrophobic regions for the PAF receptor, characteristic of the rhodopsin gene family, and is 83% identical to the deduced protein sequence of the corresponding guinea pig molecule. A modified human PAF receptor cDNA was constructed by inserting an additional 30 nucleotides after the 5'-ATG, encoding the amino acid sequence MDYKDDDDKEF, which is specifically recognized by a monoclonal antibody. The modified cDNA encodes a functional PAF receptor and is detected by antibody on the membrane of transfected COS-7 cells. The use of this construct supports the structural model for the rhodopsin-like superfamily of receptors which places the NH2-terminal sequence on the extracellular side of the membrane, and should additionally be useful for affinity purification of the receptor protein.",,
8554519,The human platelet ADP receptor activates Gi2 proteins.,"We have previously shown that platelet ADP receptors are coupled to G-proteins by measuring the binding of [35S]guanosine-5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate ([35S]GTP gamma S) to human platelet membranes stimulated with ADP. In order to identify the activated G-proteins, we used an approach which combines photolabelling of receptor-activated G-proteins with 4-azidoanilido-[alpha-32P]GTP and immunoprecipitation of the G-protein alpha-subunits with subtype-specific antibodies. Stimulation of human platelet membranes with ADP resulted in an increase in 4-azidoanilido-[alpha-32P]GTP incorporation into the immunoprecipitates of G alpha i but not of G alpha q proteins, whereas stimulation with the thromboxane analogue U46619 resulted in an increase in 4-azidoanilido-[alpha-32P]GTP incorporation into the immunoprecipitates of G alpha q but not of G alpha i proteins, and thrombin activated both G-proteins. This effect of ADP was concentration dependent and inhibited by the class P2 purinoceptor (P2T) antagonist ATP. Using specific antisera against subtypes of Gi proteins, we found that ADP stimulated labelling of the G alpha 12 immunoprecipitate, but not of the G alpha 13 precipitate. G alpha i1 was not detectable by immunoblotting of platelet membrane proteins. These data suggest that ADP inhibits cAMP formation by activation of G alpha 12 proteins and add evidence in support of the hypothesis that human platelet ADP receptors do not activate PLC through Gq activation.",The Biochemical journal,1995
8552586,The human thyrotropin receptor: a heptahelical receptor capable of stimulating members of all four G protein families.,"Thyrotropin is the primary hormone that, via one heptahelical receptor, regulates thyroid cell functions such as secretion, specific gene expression, and growth. In human thyroid, thyrotropin receptor activation leads to stimulation of the adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C cascades. However, the G proteins involved in thyrotropin receptor action have been only partially defined. In membranes of human thyroid gland, we immunologically identified alpha subunits of the G proteins Gs short, Gs long, Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, G(o) (Go2 and another form of Go, presumably Go1), Gq, G11, G12, and G13. Activation of the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor by bovine TSH led to increased incorporation of the photoreactive GTP analogue [alpha-32P]GTP azidoanilide into immunoprecipitated alpha subunits of all G proteins detected in thyroid membranes. This effect was receptor-dependent and not due to direct G protein stimulation because it was mimicked by TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies of patients suffering from Grave disease and was abolished by a receptor-blocking antiserum from a patient with autoimmune hypothyroidism. The TSH-induced activation of individual G proteins occurred with EC50 values of 5-50 milliunits/ml, indicating that the activated TSH receptor coupled with similar potency to different G proteins. When human thyroid slices were pretreated with pertussis toxin, the TSH receptor-mediated accumulation of cAMP increased by approximately 35% with TSH at 1 milliunits/ml, indicating that the TSH receptor coupled to Gs and G(i). Taken together, these findings show that, at least in human thyroid membranes, in which the protein is expressed at its physiological levels, the TSH receptor resembles a naturally occurring example of a general G protein-activating receptor.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1996
8969169,The human type I interferon receptor. Identification of the interferon beta-specific receptor-associated phosphoprotein.,"We used specific antibodies recognizing the receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and the recently cloned receptor 2.2 (IFNAR2.2) chains of the human type I interferon receptor complex to demonstrate that the interferon beta (IFN-beta)-specific receptor-associated phosphoprotein is IFNAR2.2 and not an unknown or additional receptor component. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that IFNAR2.2 is present in Daudi cells as a cell surface protein of approximately 90-100 kDa, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with IFNAR1, upon stimulation of cells with IFN-beta. IFNAR2.2 was not detected associated with IFNAR1 in cells stimulated with IFN-alpha, suggesting differences in receptor interaction between the two type I interferons. Both IFNAR1 and IFNAR2.2 undergo tyrosine phosphorylation upon induction by either IFN-alpha or IFN-beta. Therefore, it is unclear as to why IFNAR2.2 is not detectable in IFNAR1 immunoprecipitates in IFN-beta-treated cells. These data suggest that, although IFN-alpha and IFN-beta may utilize similar receptor chains, they interact with IFNAR1 and IFNAR2.2 in different ways.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
9322919,The human V3 pituitary vasopressin receptor: ligand binding profile and density-dependent signaling pathways.,"The vasopressin (AVP) V3 pituitary receptor (V3R) is a G protein-coupled corticotropic phenotypic marker that is overexpressed in ACTH-hypersecreting tumors. Studies of the agonist/antagonist binding profile and signal transduction pathways linked to the human V3R have been limited because of the scarcity of this protein. To define the signals activated by V3Rs and the eventual changes triggered by developmental or pathological receptor regulation, we developed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-V3 cells stably expressing low, medium, or high levels of human V3Rs (binding capacity, <10, 10-25, and 25-100 pmol/mg, respectively). The affinity of the V3R for 21 peptide and nonpeptide AVP analogs was clearly distinct from that exhibited by the human V1R and V2R. AVP triggered stimulation of phospholipase C in CHO-V3 cells (partially sensitive to treatment with pertussis toxin) with a potency directly proportional to receptor density. V3R-mediated arachidonic acid release also was also sensitive to pertussis toxin and more efficacious in cells exhibiting medium than in those with high receptor density. AVP also stimulated the pertussis toxin-insensitive uptake of [3H]thymidine in CHO-V3 cells. The concentration-response curves for this effect were monophasic in cells expressing low and medium levels of V3Rs; on the contrary, a biphasic curve was observed in cells with high V3R density. Coupling of V3R to increased production of cAMP was only observed in CHOV3 high cells, suggesting a negative relationship between increased cAMP production and DNA synthesis. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by V3R was pertussis toxin insensitive, but was dependent on activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C; both the level and duration of activation were a function of the receptor density. Thus, the human V3R has a pharmacological profile clearly distinct from that of the human V1R and V2R and activates several signaling pathways via different G proteins, depending on the level of receptor expression. The increased synthesis of DNA and cAMP levels observed in cells expressing medium and high levels of V3Rs, respectively, may represent important events in the tumorigenesis of corticotroph cells.",,

LIF is structurally and functionally related to another cytokine, Oncostatin M (OSM), that binds to the high-affinity LIF receptor but not to the low-affinity LIF receptor. A complementary DNA was isolated that encodes the high-affinity converting subunit of the LIF receptor. The converter conferred high-affinity binding of both LIF and OSM when expressed with the low-affinity LIF receptor and is identical to the signal transducing subunit of the IL-6 receptor, gp130. The gp130 subunit alone confers low-affinity binding of OSM when expressed in COS-7 cells.

In the present study we re-evaluated the relative role played by CD94/NKG2 and ILT2(LIR1) molecules in recognition of HLA-G1 by NK clones. We employed as targets .221-G1 cells and a surface HLA-E-negative transfectant, .221-G1(Eneg), generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the HLA-G1 leader sequence. The antagonistic effects of receptor- (ie. CD94/NKG2A, ILT2) and ligand-specific mAb (i.e. HLA-G, HLA-E) were assessed. In addition, binding of an ILT2-Ig fusion protein to the .221-AEH, expressing only HLA-E, and the .221-G1(Eneg) transfectants was analyzed. Our data demonstrate that NK recognition of cells expressing HLA-G1 involves at least two non-overlapping receptor-ligand systems: the CD94/NKG2 interaction with HLA-E, and the engagement of the ILT2(LIR1) receptor by HLA-G1 molecules.",,

However, their identity remains enigmatic due to complex cytokine ligand and receptor interactions and conflicting experimental results. Besides the classical Epo receptor, the family of type I cytokine receptors also includes the poorly characterized orphan cytokine receptor-like factor 3 (CRLF3) present in vertebrates including human and various insect species. By making use of the more simple genetic makeup of insect model systems, we studied whether CRLF3 is a neuroprotective Epo receptor in animals.

11278916,"The integrin alpha 7 cytoplasmic domain regulates cell migration, lamellipodia formation, and p130CAS/Crk coupling.","The integrin alpha(7)beta(1) is the major laminin-binding integrin in skeletal, heart, and smooth muscle and is a receptor for laminin-1 and -2. It mediates myoblast migration on laminin-1 and -2 and thus might be involved in muscle development and repair. Previously we have shown that alpha(7)B as well as the alpha(7)A and -C splice variants induce cell motility on laminin when transfected into nonmotile HEK293 cells. In this study we have investigated the role of the cytoplasmic domain of alpha(7) in the laminin-induced signal transduction of alpha(7)beta(1) integrin regulating cell adhesion and migration. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain did not affect assembly of the mutated alpha(7)Deltacyt/beta(1) heterodimer on the cell surface or adhesion of alpha(7)Deltacyt-transfected cells to laminin. The motility of these cells on the laminin-1/E8 fragment, however, was significantly reduced to the level of mock-transfected cells; lamellipodia formation and polarization of the cells were also impaired. Adhesion to the laminin-1/E8 fragment induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and p130(CAS) as well as the formation of a p130(CAS)-Crk complex in wild-type alpha(7)B-transfected cells. In alpha(7)BDeltacyt cells, however, the extent of p130(CAS) tyrosine formation was reduced and formation of the p130(CAS)-Crk complex was impaired, with unaltered levels of p130(CAS) and Crk protein levels. These findings indicate adhesion-dependent regulation of p130(CAS)/Crk complex formation by the cytoplasmic domain of alpha(7)B integrin after cell adhesion to laminin-1/E8 and imply alpha(7)B-controlled lamellipodia formation and cell migration through the p130(CAS)/Crk protein complex.",,

Extracellular activation of these complexes is a critical but incompletely understood step in regulation of TGF beta function in vivo. We show that TGF beta 1 LAP is a ligand for the integrin alpha v beta 6 and that alpha v beta 6-expressing cells induce spatially restricted activation of TGF beta 1. This finding explains why mice lacking this integrin develop exaggerated inflammation and, as we show, are protected from pulmonary fibrosis. These data identify a novel mechanism for locally regulating TGF beta 1 function in vivo by regulating expression of the alpha v beta 6 integrin.",,

A thrombin-cleaved NH(2)-terminal fragment of osteopontin containing the RGD sequence has recently been shown to also be a ligand for alpha(9)beta(1). In this report, we used site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides to identify the alpha(9)beta(1) recognition sequence in osteopontin. alpha(9)-transfected SW480, Chinese hamster ovary, and L-cells adhered to a recombinant NH(2)-terminal osteopontin fragment in which the RGD site was mutated to RAA (nOPN-RAA). Adhesion was completely inhibited by anti-alpha(9) monoclonal antibody Y9A2, indicating the presence of a non-RGD alpha(9)beta(1) recognition sequence within this fragment. Alanine substitution mutagenesis of 13 additional conserved negatively charged amino acid residues in this fragment had no effect on alpha(9)beta(1)-mediated adhesion, but adhesion was dramatically inhibited by either alanine substitution or deletion of tyrosine 165. A synthetic peptide, SVVYGLR, corresponding to the sequence surrounding Tyr(165), blocked alpha(9)beta(1)-mediated adhesion to nOPN-RAA and exposed a ligand-binding-dependent epitope on the integrin beta(1) subunit on alpha(9)-transfected, but not on mock-transfected cells. These results demonstrate that the linear sequence SVVYGLR directly binds to alpha(9)beta(1) and is responsible for alpha(9)beta(1)-mediated cell adhesion to the NH(2)-terminal fragment of osteopontin.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1999
11970960,The integrin alpha(v)beta8 mediates epithelial homeostasis through MT1-MMP-dependent activation of TGF-beta1.,"Integrins, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), and the cytokine TGF-beta have each been implicated in homeostatic cell behaviors such as cell growth and matrix remodeling. TGF-beta exists mainly in a latent state, and a major point of homeostatic control is the activation of TGF-beta. Because the latent domain of TGF-beta1 possesses an integrin binding motif (RGD), integrins have the potential to sequester latent TGF-beta (SLC) to the cell surface where TGF-beta activation could be locally controlled. Here, we show that SLC binds to alpha(v)beta8, an integrin expressed by normal epithelial and neuronal cells in vivo. This binding results in the membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP-dependent release of active TGF-beta, which leads to autocrine and paracrine effects on cell growth and matrix production. These data elucidate a novel mechanism of cellular homeostasis achieved through the coordination of the activities of members of three major gene families involved in cell-matrix interactions.",The Journal of cell biology,2002
10209034,The integrin alpha9beta1 mediates adhesion to activated endothelial cells and transendothelial neutrophil migration through interaction with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.,"The integrin alpha9beta1 has been shown to be widely expressed on smooth muscle and epithelial cells, and to mediate adhesion to the extracellular matrix proteins osteopontin and tenascin-C. We have found that the peptide sequence this integrin recognizes in tenascin-C is highly homologous to the sequence recognized by the closely related integrin alpha4beta1, in the inducible endothelial ligand, vascular cell adhesion mole-cule-1 (VCAM-1). We therefore sought to determine whether alpha9beta1 also recognizes VCAM-1, and whether any such interaction would be biologically significant. In this report, we demonstrate that alpha9beta1 mediates stable cell adhesion to recombinant VCAM-1 and to VCAM-1 induced on human umbilical vein endothelial cells by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, we show that alpha9beta1 is highly and selectively expressed on neutrophils and is critical for neutrophil migration on VCAM-1 and tenascin-C. Finally, alpha9beta1 and alpha4 integrins contribute to neutrophil chemotaxis across activated endothelial monolayers. These observations suggest a possible role for alpha9beta1/VCAM-1 interactions in extravasation of neutrophils at sites of acute inflammation.",,
12358597,The integrin alphavbeta3 is a receptor for the latency-associated peptides of transforming growth factors beta1 and beta3.,"The integrins alpha(v)beta(1), alpha(v)beta(5), alpha(v)beta(6) and alpha(v)beta(8) have all recently been shown to interact with the RGD motif of the latency-associated peptide (LAPbeta(1)) of transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGFbeta(1)), with binding to alpha(v)beta(6) and alpha(v)beta(8) leading to TGFbeta(1) activation. Previously it has been suggested that the remaining alpha(v) integrin, alpha(v)beta(3,) does not interact with LAPbeta(1). However, here we show clearly that alpha(v)beta(3) does indeed interact with the LAPbeta(1) RGD motif. This interaction is similar to other alpha(v)beta(3) ligands in terms of the cations required for adhesion, the concentrations of LAPbeta(1) required for binding and the ability of a small-molecule inhibitor of alpha(v)beta(3), SB223245, to block the interaction. Using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins we have mapped a minimal integrin-binding loop in LAPbeta(1) and then used this approach to probe the integrin-binding properties of the equivalent loops in LAPbeta(2) and LAPbeta(3). We show that the RGD motif of LAPbeta(3) also interacts with alpha(v)beta(3), in addition to alpha(v)beta(6), alpha(v)beta(1) and alpha(v)beta(5), whereas the corresponding loop in LAPbeta(2) does not interact with these integrins. These observations therefore correct a previously reported inaccuracy in the literature. Furthermore, they are important as they link alpha(v)beta(3) and TGFbeta, which may have implications in cancer and a number of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases where expression of both proteins has been documented.",,
8760827,The inter-locus recombinant HLA-B*4601 has high selectivity in peptide binding and functions characteristic of HLA-C.,"The vast majority of new human HLA class I alleles are formed by conversions between existing alleles of the same locus. A notable exception to this rule is HLA-B*4601 formed by replacement of residues 66-76 of the alpha 1 helix of B*1501 by the homologous segment of Cw*0102. This inter-locus recombination, which brings together characteristic elements of HLA-B and HLA-C structure, is shown here to influence function dramatically. Naturally processed peptides bound by B*4601 are distinct from those of its parental allotypes B*1501 and Cw*0102 and dominated by three high abundance peptides. Such increased peptide selectivity by B*4601 is unique among HLA-A,B,C allotypes. For other aspects of function, presence of the small segment of HLA-C-derived sequence in an otherwise HLA-B framework converts B*4601 to an HLA-C-like molecule. Alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), natural killer (NK) cells, and cellular glycosidases all recognize B*4601 as though it were an HLA-C allotype. These unusual properties are those of an allotype which has frequencies as high as 20% in south east Asian populations and is associated with predisposition to autoimmune diseases and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",The Journal of experimental medicine,1996
10103110,The interaction between F3 immunoglobulin domains and protein tyrosine phosphatases zeta/beta triggers bidirectional signalling between neurons and glial cells.,"F3, a mouse glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchored molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is known to influence axonal growth and fasciculation via multiple interactions of its modular immunoglobulin-like domains. We prepared an Fc chimeric molecule (F3IgFc) to identify molecules interacting with these domains and characterize the functional impact of the interactions. We affinity-isolated tenascin-C and isoforms of the proteoglycan-type protein tyrosine phosphatases zeta/beta (PTPzeta/RPTPbeta) from extracts of developing mouse brain. We showed that both PTPzeta/RPTPbeta and tenascin-C can bind directly to F3, possibly in an exclusive manner, with the highest affinity for the F3-PTPzeta/RPTPbeta interaction. We observed a strong binding of F3IgFc-coated fluorospheres to astrocytes in neural primary cultures and to C6 astrocytoma cells, and demonstrated, in antibody perturbation experiments, that F3-Ig binding on astrocytes depends on its interaction with PTPzeta/RPTPbeta. We also found by confocal analysis that tenascin-C and PTPzeta/RPTPbeta were colocalized on astrocytes which suggests a complex interplay of interactions between PTPzeta/RPTPbeta, tenascin-C and F3. We showed that the interaction between PTPzeta/RPTPbeta and F3-Ig-like domains can trigger bidirectional signalling. C6 glia-expressed PTPzeta/RPTPbeta stimulated neurite outgrowth by cortical and cerebellar neurons, whereas preclustered F3IgFc specifically modified the distribution of phosphotyrosine labelling in these glial cells. Both effects could be prevented and/or mimicked by anti-F3 and anti-6B4PG antibodies. These results identify F3 and PTPzeta/RPTPbeta as potential mediators of a reciprocal exchange of information between glia and neurons.",The European journal of neuroscience,1999
26643105,The interaction of lubricin/proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) with toll-like receptors 2 and 4: an anti-inflammatory role of PRG4 in synovial fluid.,Lubricin/proteoglycan-4 (PRG4) is a mucinous glycoprotein secreted by synovial fibroblasts and superficial zone chondrocytes. PRG4 has a homeostatic multifaceted role in the joint. PRG4 intra-articular treatment retards progression of cartilage degeneration in pre-clinical posttraumatic osteoarthritis models. The objective of this study is to evaluate the binding of recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4) and native human PRG4 (nhPRG4) to toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and TLR4) and whether this interaction underpins a PRG4 anti-inflammatory role in synovial fluid (SF) from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).,,
1851182,"The interaction of proinsulin with the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor in human liver, muscle, and adipose tissue.","Because of the sequence homology and tertiary structure similarities between proinsulin (PI) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), it is possible that PI interacts with the IGF-I receptor with higher affinity than insulin. To test this hypothesis in man, we have partially purified IGF-I receptors from liver, muscle, and adipose tissue and studied their interaction with PI, insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II. With some tissue to tissue variation, [125I]insulin binding was 4- to 8-fold greater than IGF-I binding. Unlabeled IGF-I at about 1 x 10(-9 M, IGF-II at about 1 x 10(-8) M, and insulin at about 1 x 10(-6) M displace 50% the binding of [125I]IGF-I to its receptor, whereas PI at 1 x 10(-6) M displaces less than 20% of the binding of [125I]IGF-I to its receptor. We conclude that in human liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, PI does not interact with the IGF-I receptor at a higher affinity than insulin, and the affinity of IGF-I receptors is several-fold lower than that of insulin receptors. It is, therefore, unlikely that if PI were to be administered to man any of its biological effects would be by interacting with the IGF-I receptor.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,1991
8422437,"The interaction of soluble human complement receptor type 1 (sCR1, BRL55730) with human complement component C4.","Human CR1 is a membrane-bound protein which plays an important role in the control of the human complement system. In addition to its involvement in the processing and clearance of immune complexes with C3b or C4b on their surface, CR1 acts as a cofactor for the proteolysis of C3b and C4b by Factor I. sCR1 is a recombinant, soluble form of CR1 which retains the cofactor activities of CR1, and is of potential therapeutic value for the suppression of complement-mediated tissue damage in vivo. An assay has been established using microtitre plates to explore the binding of sCR1 to the two isotypes of C4, C4A and C4B, and to C4 fragments. Specific binding of 125I-sCR1 to C4b and ammonia-treated C4 has been demonstrated. The binding of 125I-sCR1 to ammonia-treated C4 is dependent on pH and ionic strength, decreasing with an increase in pH and with an increase in ionic strength. At physiological ionic strength, up to twice as much 125I-sCR1 bound to ammonia-treated C4A as bound to ammonia-treated C4B. This preference of sCR1 for binding to the C4A isotype has implications for the clinical association of immune complex disease with C4A null alleles.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,1993
19815499,The interaction of TIGIT with PVR and PVRL2 inhibits human NK cell cytotoxicity.,"NK cell cytotoxicity is controlled by numerous NK inhibitory and activating receptors. Most of the inhibitory receptors bind MHC class I proteins and are expressed in a variegated fashion. It was recently shown that TIGIT, a new protein expressed by T and NK cells binds to PVR and PVR-like receptors and inhibits T cell activity indirectly through the manipulation of DC activity. Here, we show that TIGIT is expressed by all human NK cells, that it binds PVR and PVRL2 but not PVRL3 and that it inhibits NK cytotoxicity directly through its ITIM. Finally, we show that TIGIT counter inhibits the NK-mediated killing of tumor cells and protects normal cells from NK-mediated cytotoxicity thus providing an ""alternative self"" mechanism for MHC class I inhibition.",,
16045811,The interaction of versican with its binding partners.,"Versican belongs to the family of the large aggregating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans located primarily within the extracellular matrix (ECM). Versican, like other members of its family, has unique N- and C-terminal globular regions, each with multiple motifs. A large glycosaminoglycan-binding region lies between them. This review will begin by outlining these structures, in the context of ECM proteoglycans. The diverse binding partners afforded to versican by virtue of its modular design will then be examined. These include ECM components, such as hyaluronan, type I collagen, tenascin-R, fibulin-1, and -2, fibrillin-1, fibronectin, P- and L-selectins, and chemokines. Versican also binds to the cell surface proteins CD44, integrin beta 1, epidermal growth factor receptor, and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1. These multiple interactors play important roles in cell behaviour, and the roles of versican in modulating such processes are discussed.",Cell research,2005
22410872,The interferons and their receptors--distribution and regulation.,"The interferons (IFNs) were originally described over 50 years ago, identified by their ability to confer viral resistance to cells. We now know that they are much more than just anti-viral cytokines collectively having roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses, in tumor surveillance and defense, and modulation of immune cell function. Three types of IFN have now been described, simply referred to as type I, II and III. Distinguishable by the unique receptors that they rely on for signal transduction, the three types of IFN have specific and varied roles in the maintenance of human health and defense against pathogens. In mounting an IFN-mediated immune response, the human body has developed the ability to regulate IFN-mediated signal transduction. Like all cytokines, the ability of a cell to respond to IFN is completely dependent on the presence of its cognate receptor on the surface of the target cell. Thus, one of the major mechanisms used by the human body to regulate the strength and duration of the IFN response is through regulation of receptor levels, thereby altering the cytokine-specific responsiveness of the target cell. This review will discuss the receptor system utilized by the type I IFNs and compare it with that of the type II and III IFNs, which also regulate immune responses through controlling receptor level on the cell surface.",Immunology and cell biology,2012

9698373,The kinase homology domain of retinal guanylyl cyclases 1 and 2 specifies the affinity and cooperativity of interaction with guanylyl cyclase activating protein-2.,"RetGC-1 and RetGC-2 are photoreceptor membrane guanylyl cyclases that are regulated by the Ca2+-binding protein, GCAP-2. We used a protease protection assay to localize regions of the intracellular domains of RetGCs important for the interaction with GCAP-2 and found that GCAP-2 reduces the access of trypsin to a site in the kinase homology domain (KHD) of RetGC-1. The protective effect of GCAP-2 is independent of Ca2+. We also found that RetGC-2 and GCAP-2 interact cooperatively with high affinity, but RetGC-1 and GCAP-2 interact noncooperatively with low affinity. By analyzing RetGC-1/RetGC-2 chimeras we demonstrated that the affinity and cooperativity of the interaction with GCAP-2 is dictated by the structure of the KHD. These findings suggest that GCAP-2 interacts constituitively with the KHDs of RetGC-1 and RetGC-2 and that cGMP synthesis is controlled by Ca2+-dependent conformational changes in the RetGC/GCAP complex.",,
11713248,The kinase-null EphB6 receptor undergoes transphosphorylation in a complex with EphB1.,"Uniquely for the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases, the EphB6 receptor is catalytically inactive due to the alteration of several critical residues in its kinase domain. This has cast doubt upon its ability to participate in cytoplasmic signaling events. We show here that despite its lack of kinase activity, EphB6 undergoes inducible tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation with the Eph-B receptor subfamily ligand ephrin-B1. We also demonstrate, for the first time, evidence of cross-talk between Eph receptors. Overexpression of a catalytically active member of the Eph-B subfamily, EphB1, resulted in increased EphB6 phosphorylation. EphB1-induced EphB6 phosphorylation was ligand-dependent and required the functional catalytic activity of EphB1. EphB1 not only transphosphorylated EphB6, but together they also formed a stable hetero-complex. In addition, we identify the proto-oncogene c-Cbl as an EphB6-binding protein. Although EphB6-Cbl association appeared to be constitutive, Cbl required a functional phosphotyrosine binding domain in order to bind the receptor, whereas its RING finger motif ubiquitin-transfer domain was not necessary. Our findings demonstrate that EphB6 is an actively signaling receptor that undergoes transphosphorylation upon ligand binding and that can initiate specific cytoplasmic signaling events.",,
9647658,The laminin-nidogen complex is a ligand for a specific splice isoform of the transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase LAR.,"Leukocyte antigen-related protein (LAR) is a prototype for a family of transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatases whose extracellular domain is composed of three Ig and several fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains. Complex alternative splicing of the LAR-FnIII domains 4-8 has been observed. The extracellular matrix laminin-nidogen complex was identified as a ligand for the LAR-FnIII domain 5 (Fn5) using a series of GST-LAR-FnIII domain fusion proteins and testing them in in vitro ligand-binding assays. LAR- laminin-nidogen binding was regulated by alternative splicing of a small exon within the LAR-Fn5 so that inclusion of this exon sequence resulted in disruption of the laminin-nidogen-binding activity. Long cellular processes were observed when HeLa cells were plated on laminin-nidogen, but not when plated on a fibronectin surface. Indirect immunofluorescent antibody staining revealed high expression of LAR in a punctate pattern, throughout the length of these cellular processes observed on laminin-nidogen. Antibody-induced cross-linking of LAR inhibited formation of these cellular processes, and inhibition was correlated with changes in cellular actin cytoskeletal structure. Thus, LAR-laminin-nidogen binding may play a role in regulating cell signaling induced by laminin-nidogen, resulting in cell morphological changes.",The Journal of cell biology,1998
2779654,"The LDL-receptor-related protein, LRP, is an apolipoprotein E-binding protein.","The low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is a cell-surface protein that plays an important part in the metabolism of cholesterol by mediating the uptake of LDL from plasma into cells. Although LDL particles bind to the LDL receptor through their apolipoprotein B (apo B) and apolipoprotein E (apo E) moieties, other apo E-containing particles, like chylomicron remnants, are not dependent on the LDL receptor for uptake into cells. Chylomicrons formed in the intestinal mucosa during the absorption of the products of digestion, are processed by the peripheral circulation by lipoprotein lipase, which catalyses the breakdown of triglycerides in chylomicrons to free fatty acids and glycerol. The resulting chylomicron remnants, which are cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, are subsequently taken up in the liver. A second distinct protein that binds to apo E-containing lipoproteins, but not to LDL, has been proposed to be the receptor mediating the clearance of chylomicron remnants from the plasma. This protein has a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 56,000 (56K). More recent studies have failed, however, to establish whether this protein is a cell-surface receptor. Here we describe crosslinking experiments in which apo E liposomes were found to bind specifically to the cell surface of hepG2 cells and to human liver membranes. The size and immunological cross-reactivity of the protein to which the liposomes bound was indistinguishable from that of the recently cloned and sequenced LDL-receptor-related protein, LRP. We therefore conclude that the LRP might function as an apo E receptor.",Nature,1989
24752896,The leukocyte activation receptor CD69 controls T cell differentiation through its interaction with galectin-1.,"CD69 is involved in immune cell homeostasis, regulating the T cell-mediated immune response through the control of Th17 cell differentiation. However, natural ligands for CD69 have not yet been described. Using recombinant fusion proteins containing the extracellular domain of CD69, we have detected the presence of a ligand(s) for CD69 on human dendritic cells (DCs). Pulldown followed by mass spectrometry analyses of CD69-binding moieties on DCs identified galectin-1 as a CD69 counterreceptor. Surface plasmon resonance and anti-CD69 blocking analyses demonstrated a direct and specific interaction between CD69 and galectin-1 that was carbohydrate dependent. Functional assays with both human and mouse T cells demonstrated the role of CD69 in the negative effect of galectin-1 on Th17 differentiation. Our findings identify CD69 and galectin-1 to be a novel regulatory receptor-ligand pair that modulates Th17 effector cell differentiation and function.",,
10438935,The leukocyte integrin alpha D beta 2 binds VCAM-1: evidence for a binding interface between I domain and VCAM-1.,"The trafficking of leukocytes through tissues is supported by an interaction between the beta 2 (CD18) integrins CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) and CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) and their ligand ICAM-1. The most recently identified and fourth member of the beta 2 integrins, alpha D beta 2, selectively binds ICAM-3 and does not appear to bind ICAM-1. We have reported recently that alpha D beta 2 can support eosinophil adhesion to VCAM-1. Here we demonstrate that expression of alpha D beta 2 in a lymphoid cell that does not express alpha 4 integrins confers efficient binding to VCAM-1. In addition, a soluble form of alpha D beta 2 binds VCAM-1 with greater efficiency relative to ICAM-3. The I domain of alpha D contains a binding site for VCAM-1 since recombinant alpha D I domain binds specifically to VCAM-1. In addition, alpha D mAb that block cellular binding to VCAM-1 bind the alpha D I domain. Using VCAM-1 mutants we have determined that the binding site on VCAM-1 for alpha D beta 2 overlaps with that of alpha 4++ integrins. Substitution of VCAM-1 aspartate at position 40, D40, within the conserved integrin binding site, diminishes binding to alpha D beta 2 and abrogates binding to the alpha D I domain. The corresponding integrin binding site residue in ICAM-3 is also essential to alpha D beta 2 binding. Finally, we demonstrate that alpha D beta 2 can support lymphoid cell adhesion to VCAM-1 under flow conditions at levels equivalent to those mediated by alpha 4 beta 1. These results indicate that VCAM-1 can bind to an I domain and that the binding of alpha D beta 2 to VCAM-1 may contribute to the trafficking of a subpopulation of leukocytes that express alpha D beta 2.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",1999

Activation by a heterologous beta subunit and localization of a ligand recognition site to the I domain.","p150,95 is a member of the leukocyte integrin family of adhesion proteins. Compared with LFA-1 and Mac-1, p150,95 is less well functionally characterized. Although p150,95 has complement receptor activity for iC3b and has been designated complement receptor type 4, transfected cells expressing p150,95 do not bind iC3b-sensitized cells. We report that cells cotransfected with a human p150,95 alpha subunit and a chicken, but not human, beta subunit bind IgM-iC3b-coated erythrocytes, suggesting that interactions between the alpha and beta subunits can regulate p150,95 adhesiveness. Furthermore, purified human p150,95 binds to cell-bound iC3b-coated erythrocytes. Because binding to iC3b by cellular and purified p150,95 is specifically abolished by mAbs that localize to the I domain of p150,95, we suggest that the I domain of the p150,95 alpha subunit is an important ligand recognition site for iC3b.",,
7961636,The ligand binding site of the neurokinin 2 receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis and identification of neurokinin A binding residues in the human neurokinin 2 receptor.,"Thirteen residues in the human neurokinin 2 (NK2) receptor were identified as potential ligand-binding residues by molecular modeling and amino acid sequence analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter these residues in order to ascertain their importance in binding neurokinin A (NKA), the physiological peptide ligand for the NK2 receptor, and the non-peptide NK2 receptor selective antagonist SR48968. Four sites appear to be critical for NKA binding (Gln109, His198, Ile202, and Gly273). The mutant receptors Gln109-->His, Ile202-->Val, Gly273-->Pro, and Gly273-->Thr maintain their affinity for SR48968, despite being unable to bind the peptide ligand. His198-->Ala and His198-->Leu no longer bind NKA or SR48968. We have also identified a residue (Leu292) which appears to play a minor role in the binding of substance P (SP) and neurokinin B (NKB) to the NK2 receptor. The mutant receptor Leu292-->Ser binds NKB and SP with approximately a 5-fold greater affinity in comparison with the wild type receptor while the affinity of NKA remains unaffected. The results suggest that intramembranous residues, as well as residues which lie close to the extracellular side of transmembrane helices 3, 5, and 6, form part of the NK2 receptor binding site. Binding of SP and NKB to the NK2 receptor may also be influenced by residues near the extracellular side of helix 7. These results suggest that some regions of the binding site for NKA in the NK2 receptor are not used for binding SP in the NK1 receptor. However, it also seems that the NKA binding site includes regions that are also used by other G-protein-coupled receptors such as rhodopsin and the beta 2-adrenergic receptors.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1994
1852007,The ligand specificities of the insulin receptor and the insulin-like growth factor I receptor reside in different regions of a common binding site.,"To identify the region(s) of the insulin receptor and the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor responsible for ligand specificity (high-affinity binding), expression vectors encoding soluble chimeric insulin/IGF-I receptors were prepared. The chimeric receptors were expressed in mammalian cells and partially purified. Binding studies revealed that a construct comprising an IGF-I receptor in which the 68 N-terminal amino acids of the insulin receptor alpha-subunit had replaced the equivalent IGF-I receptor segment displayed a markedly increased affinity for insulin. In contrast, the corresponding IGF-I receptor sequence is not critical for high-affinity IGF-I binding. It is shown that part of the cysteine-rich domain determines IGF-I specificity. We have previously shown that exchanging exons 1, 2, and 3 of the insulin receptor with the corresponding IGF-I receptor sequence results in loss of high affinity for insulin and gain of high affinity for IGF-I. Consequently, it is suggested that the ligand specificities of the two receptors (i.e., the sequences that discriminate between insulin and IGF-I) reside in different regions of a binding site with common features present in both receptors.",,
11110785,"The ligands of CXC chemokine receptor 3, I-TAC, Mig, and IP10, are natural antagonists for CCR3.","Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes express a different repertoire of chemokine receptors (CCRs). CXCR3, the receptor for I-TAC (interferon-inducible T cell alpha-chemoattractant), Mig (monokine induced by gamma-interferon), and IP10 (interferon-inducible protein 10), is expressed preferentially on Th1 cells, whereas CCR3, the receptor for eotaxin and several other CC chemokines, is characteristic of Th2 cells. While studying responses that are mediated by these two receptors, we found that the agonists for CXCR3 act as antagonists for CCR3. I-TAC, Mig, and IP10 compete for the binding of eotaxin to CCR3-bearing cells and inhibit migration and Ca(2+) changes induced in such cells by stimulation with eotaxin, eotaxin-2, MCP-2 (monocyte chemottractant protein-2), MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted). A hybrid chemokine generated by substituting the first eight NH(2)-terminal residues of eotaxin with those of I-TAC bound CCR3 with higher affinity than eotaxin or I-TAC (3- and 10-fold, respectively). The hybrid was 5-fold more potent than I-TAC as an inhibitor of eotaxin activity and was effective at concentrations as low as 5 nm. None of the antagonists described induced the internalization of CCR3, indicating that they lack agonistic effects and thus qualify as pure antagonists. These results suggest that chemokines that attract Th1 cells via CXCR3 can concomitantly block the migration of Th2 cells in response to CCR3 ligands, thus enhancing the polarization of T cell recruitment.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
14739301,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-1, LRP1, interacts with the human frizzled-1 (HFz1) and down-regulates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.","Members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family (LDLR), LRP5/6, were shown to interact with the Frizzled (Fz) receptors and to function as Wnt coreceptors. Here we show that mLRP4T100, a minireceptor of LRP1, another member of the LDLR family, interacts with the human Fz-1 (HFz1), previously shown to serve as a receptor transmitting the canonical Wnt-3a-induced signaling cascade. However, in contrast to LRP5/6, mLRP4T100, as well as the full-length LRP1, did not cooperate with HFz1 in transmitting the Wnt-3a signaling but rather repressed it. mLRP4T100 inhibitory effect was displayed also by endocytosis-defective mLRP4T100 mutants, suggesting that LRP1 repressive effect is not attributable to LRP1-mediated enhanced HFz1 internalization and subsequent degradation. Enforced expression of mLRP4T100 decreased the capacity of HFz1 cysteine-rich domain (CRD) to interact with LRP6, in contrast to HFz1-CRD/Wnt-3a interaction that was not disrupted by overexpressing mLRP4T100. These data suggest that LRP1, by sequestering HFz1, disrupts the receptor/coreceptor complex formation, leading to the repression of the canonical Wnt signaling. Thus, this study implies that the ability to interact with Fz receptors is shared by several members of the LDLR family. However, whereas some members of the LDLR family, such as LRP5/6, interact with Fz and serve as Wnt coreceptors, others negatively regulate Wnt signaling, presumably by sequestering Fz.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2004
8824219,The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein can function independently from heparan sulfate proteoglycans in tissue factor pathway inhibitor endocytosis.,"Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a plasma serine protease inhibitor that directly inhibits coagulation factor Xa and regulates blood coagulation via inhibition of factor VIIa-tissue factor enzymatic activity. We previously demonstrated that >90% of TFPI bound to a single population of low affinity binding sites on hepatoma cells (2 x 10(6) sites/cell, Kd = 30 nM), and, that following binding, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) mediated TFPI uptake and degradation. We subsequently reported heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) constitute a second receptor system involved in TFPI catabolism. In the present study, mouse embryonic fibroblasts heterozygous and homozygous-negative for disruption of the LRP gene were used to further examine the roles of LRP and HSPGs in TFPI endocytosis. We demonstrate that LRP is absolutely required for degrading 125I-TFPI. LRP heterozygous and homozygous-negative cells bind 125I-TFPI similarly, and the 39-kDa protein, an inhibitor of all known ligand interactions with LRP, does not alter 125I-TFPI binding to these cells. TFPI can be cross-linked to LRP on [35S]cysteine-labeled hepatoma and LRP-heterozygous cells but not LRP-negative cells. When HSPGs are blocked with protamine, 125I-TFPI binds in a 39-kDa protein-inhibitable manner to 41,000 high affinity sites/hepatoma cell (Kd = 2.3 nM). Blockade of HSPGs with protamine results in significantly more 125I-TFPI degradation by LRP-positive cells. TFPI can be cross-linked to LRP in the absence and presence of protamine. However, in the presence of protamine, relative to the total pool of cross-linked proteins, 5-fold more TFPI is cross-linked to LRP. Finally, we show TFPI inhibits 125I-alpha2-macroglobulin-methylamine binding to hepatoma cells and that carboxyl-terminal residues 115-319 of the 39-kDa protein inhibit both 125I-TFPI degradation and binding when binding conditions contain protamine. Together, our results suggest that while the majority of TFPI binds to cell surface HSPGs, LRP can function independently from HSPGs in the binding and uptake of TFPI.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1996
15001579,The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein is a motogenic receptor for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.,"Although plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is known to stimulate cell migration, little is known about underlying mechanisms. We show that both active and inactive (e.g. cleaved) PAI-1 can activate the Jak/Stat signaling system and stimulate cell migration in chemotaxis, haptotaxis, chemokinesis, and wound healing assays. Moreover, antibodies to the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) and an LRP antagonist (RAP) blocked these motogenic effects of PAI-1, while a PAI-1 mutant that did not bind to LRP failed to activate the Jak/Stat signaling pathway or to stimulate cell migration. PAI-1 had no chemotactic effect on LRP-deficient cells. These results indicate that LRP is a signaling molecule, that it mediates the migration-promoting activity of PAI-1, and that this activity does not require intact, biologically active PAI-1. Activation of this LRP-dependent signaling pathway by PAI-1 may begin to explain how the inhibitor stimulates cell migration in a variety of normal and pathological processes.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2004
11279011,The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein modulates levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) by mediating its cellular catabolism.,"Members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of enzymes participate in matrix remodeling and share a number of structural and functional features. The activity of this family of proteinases is carefully regulated at the level of zymogen activation and by a family of specific inhibitors termed tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP). It is now becoming clear that levels of certain MMPs are modulated by their association with cellular receptors that mediate their rapid internalization and degradation. In the current investigation we report that the amount of MMP-9 in conditioned cell culture medium is significantly increased when mouse embryonic fibroblasts are grown in the presence of the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist of ligand binding to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). In vitro assays reveal that the MMP-9.TIMP-1 complex binds to LRP with high affinity and that the binding determinant for LRP appears to reside on MMP-9. Cell lines expressing LRP mediate the internalization of 125I-labeled MMP-9.TIMP-1 complexes, whereas cell lines genetically deficient in LRP show a diminished capacity to mediate the cellular catabolism of MMP-9.TIMP-1 complexes. The results demonstrate that LRP is a functional receptor for MMP-9 and suggest a major role for LRP in modulating remodeling of the extracellular matrix by regulating extracellular proteinase activity.",,
1281473,The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor binds and mediates catabolism of bovine milk lipoprotein lipase.,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the major lipolytic enzyme involved in the conversion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to remnants, was found to compete with binding of activated alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M*) to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor. Bovine milk LPL displaced both 125I-labeled alpha 2M* and 39-kDa alpha 2M receptor-associated protein (RAP) from the surface of cultured mutant fibroblasts lacking LDL receptors with apparent KI values at 4 degrees C of 6.8 and 30 nM, respectively. Furthermore, LPL inhibited the cellular degradation of 125I-alpha 2M* at 37 degrees C. Because both alpha 2M* and RAP interact with LRP, these data suggest that LPL binds specifically to this receptor. This was further supported by observing that an immunoaffinity-isolated polyclonal antibody against LRP blocked cellular degradation of 125I-LPL in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, 125I-LPL bound to highly purified LRP in a solid-phase assay with a KD of 18 nM, and this binding could be partially displaced with alpha 2M* (KI = 7 nM) and RAP (KI = 3 nM). Taken together, these data establish that LPL binds with high affinity to LRP and undergoes LRP-mediated cellular uptake. The implication of these findings for lipoprotein catabolism in vivo may be important if LRP binding is preserved when LPL is attached to lipoproteins. If so, LPL might facilitate LRP-mediated clearance of lipoproteins.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1992
15178744,The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 is a mitogenic receptor for lactoferrin in osteoblastic cells.,"Lactoferrin induces osteoblast proliferation and survival in vitro and is anabolic to bone in vivo. The molecular mechanisms by which lactoferrin exerts these biological actions are not known, but lactoferrin is known to bind to two members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, low- density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 1 (LRP1) and 2 (LRP2). We have examined the role(s) of these receptors in the actions of lactoferrin on osteoblasts. We show that lactoferrin binds to cultured osteoblastic cells, and that LRP1 and LRP2 are expressed in several osteoblastic cell types. In primary rat osteoblastic cells, the LRP1/2 inhibitor receptor associated protein blocks endocytosis of lactoferrin and abrogates lactoferrin-induced p42/44 MAPK signaling and mitogenesis. Lactoferrin-induced mitogenesis is also inhibited by an antibody to LRP1. Lactoferrin also induces receptor associated protein-sensitive activation of p42/44 MAPK signaling and proliferation in osteoblastic human SaOS-2 cells, which express LRP1 but not LRP2. The mitogenic response of LRP1-null fibroblastic cells to lactoferrin is substantially reduced compared with that of cells expressing wild-type LRP1. The endocytic and signaling functions of LRP1 are independent of each other, because lactoferrin can activate mitogenic signaling in conditions in which endocytosis is inhibited. Taken together, these results 1) suggest that mitogenic signaling through LRP1 to p42/44 MAPKs contributes to the anabolic skeletal actions of lactoferrin; 2) demonstrate growth-promoting actions of a third LRP family member in osteoblasts; and 3) provide further evidence that LRP1 functions as a signaling receptor in addition to its recognized role in ligand endocytosis.",,
14980518,"The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein associates with calnexin, calreticulin, and protein disulfide isomerase in receptor-associated-protein-deficient fibroblasts.","The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a large (>600 kDa) multi-ligand-binding cell surface receptor that is now known to participate in a diverse range of cellular events. To accomplish this diverse role, LRP is composed of repetitive amino acid motifs consisting of complement-type and EGF precursor-type repeats. Within these repeats are six conserved cysteine residues that form the core disulfide bond structure of each repeat. To accommodate the intricate folding that such a complex structure dictates, a specialized chaperone is present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) called the receptor-associated protein (RAP) that binds to LRP immediately following its biosynthesis and assists in its exocytic transport. Interestingly, RAP -/- mice show reduced LRP expression in certain cell types, but not a more global affect on LRP expression that was expected. Such a tissue-restricted effect by RAP prompted an investigation if other ER chaperones associate with LRP to assist in its complex folding requirements and compensate for the absence of RAP in RAP -/- cells. Fibroblasts obtained from RAP -/- mice demonstrate similar LRP expression levels and subcellular distribution as RAP +/+ fibroblasts. Moreover, RAP -/- cells show an identical exocytic trafficking rate for LRP as RAP +/+ cells and comparable cell surface internalization kinetics. In RAP -/- cells, three well-known ER chaperones, calnexin, calreticulin, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), associate with LRP and likely compensate for the absence of RAP.",Experimental cell research,2004
10493819,The luteinizing hormone receptor activates phospholipase C via preferential coupling to Gi2.,"Binding of lutropin/choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) to its cognate receptor results in the activation of adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C. This divergent signaling of the LH receptor is based on the independent activation of distinct G protein subfamilies, i.e. , Gs, Gi, and potentially also Gq. To examine the selectivity of LH receptor coupling to phospholipase C beta-activating G proteins, we used an in vivo reconstitution system based on the coexpression of the LH receptor and different G proteins in baculovirus-infected insect cells. In this paper, we describe a refined expression strategy for the LH receptor in insect cells. The receptor protein was inserted into the cell membrane at an expression level of 0.8 pmol/mg of membrane protein. Sf9 cells expressing the LH receptor responded to hCG challenge with a concentration-dependent accumulation of intracellular cAMP (EC50 = 630 nM) but not of inositol phosphates, whereas stimulation of the histamine H1 receptor in Sf9 cells led to increased phospholipase C (PLC) activity. Immunoblotting experiments using G protein-specific antisera revealed the absence of quantitative amounts of alpha i in Sf9 cells, whereas alpha s and alpha q/11 were detected. We therefore attempted to restore the hCG-dependent PLC activation by infection of Sf9 cells with viruses encoding the LH receptor and different G protein alpha subunits. HCG stimulation of cells coexpressing the LH receptor and exogenous alpha i2 resulted in stimulation of PLC activity. In cells coinfected with an alpha i3-baculovirus, hCG challenge led to a minor activation of PLC, whereas no hCG-dependent PLC stimulation was observed in cells coexpressing alpha i1. Most notably, coinfection with baculoviruses encoding alpha q or alpha 11 did not reproduce the PLC activation by the LH receptor. Thus, the murine LH receptor activates adenylyl cyclase via Gs and PLC via selective coupling to Gi2.",,
15590642,The lymphangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factors VEGF-C and -D are ligands for the integrin alpha9beta1.,"Mice homozygous for a null mutation of the integrin alpha9 subunit die 6-12 days after birth from bilateral chylothoraces suggesting an underlying defect in lymphatic development. However, until now the mechanisms by which the integrin alpha9beta1 modulates lymphangiogenesis have not been described. In this study we show that adhesion to and migration on the lymphangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF-C and -D) are alpha9beta1-dependent. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human colon carcinoma cells (SW-480) transfected to express alpha9beta1 adhered and/or migrated on both growth factors in a concentration-dependent fashion, and both adhesion and migration were abrogated by anti-alpha9beta1 function-blocking antibody. In SW-480 cells, which lack cognate receptors for VEGF-C and -D, both growth factors induced alpha9beta1-dependent Erk and paxillin phosphorylation. Human microvascular endothelial cells, which express both alpha9beta1 and VEGF-R3, also adhered to and migrated on both growth factors, and both responses were blocked by anti-alpha9beta1 antibody. Furthermore, in a solid phase binding assay recombinant VEGF-C and -D bound to purified alpha9beta1 integrin in a dose- and cation-dependent fashion showing that VEGF-C and VEGF-D are ligands for the integrin alpha9beta1. The interaction between alpha9beta1 and VEGF-C and/or -D may begin to explain the abnormal lymphatic phenotype of the alpha9 knock-out mice.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2005
8752280,The lymphocyte chemoattractant SDF-1 is a ligand for LESTR/fusin and blocks HIV-1 entry.,"Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that activate and direct the migration of leukocytes. There are two subfamilies, the CXC and the CC chemokines. We recently found that the CXC-chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a highly efficacious lymphocyte chemoattractant. Chemokines act on responsive leukocyte subsets through G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors, which are also used by distinct strains of HIV-1 as cofactors for viral entry. Laboratory-adapted and some T-cell-line-tropic (T-tropic) primary viruses use the orphan chemokine receptor LESTR/fusin (also known as fusin), whereas macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 isolates use CCR-5 and CCR-3 (refs 7-11), which are receptors for known CC chemokines. Testing of potential receptors demonstrated that SDF-1 signalled through, and hence 'adopted', the orphan receptor LESTR, which we therefore designate CXC-chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR-4). SDF-1 induced an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ and chemotaxis in CXCR-4-transfected cells. Because SDF-1 is a biological ligand for the HIV-1 entry cofactor LESTR, we tested whether it inhibited HIV-1. SDF-1 inhibited infection by T-tropic HIV-1 of HeLa-CD4 cells, CXCR-4 transfectants, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but did not affect CCR-5-mediated infection by macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) and dual-tropic primary HIV-1.",,
11724793,The lymphocyte metalloprotease MDC-L (ADAM 28) is a ligand for the integrin alpha4beta1.,"The interaction of lymphocytes with other cells is critical for normal immune surveillance and response. MDC-L (ADAM 28), a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) protein family, is expressed on the surface of human lymphocytes. ADAMs possess a disintegrin-like domain similar in sequence to small non-enzymatic snake venom peptides that act as integrin antagonists. We report here that the disintegrin domain of MDC-L is recognized by the leukocyte integrin alpha(4)beta(1). Recombinant Fc fusion proteins possessing the disintegrin domain of MDC-L supported adhesion of the T-lymphoma cell line, Jurkat, in a concentration- and divalent cation-dependent manner. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the disintegrin domain of MDC-L was inhibited by an anti-MDC-L monoclonal antibody (mAb), Dis1-1. The epitope for mAb Dis1-1 was localized within 59 residues of the disintegrin domain. Recombinant expression of this 59-residue fragment of the disintegrin domain also supported cell adhesion. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the MDC-L disintegrin domain was specifically inhibited by anti-alpha(4) and anti-beta(1) function-blocking mAbs. Furthermore, adhesion of various cell lines to MDC-L correlated with expression of the integrin alpha(4)-subunit. Transfected K562 cells expressing alpha(4)beta(1) adhered to the disintegrin domain in contrast to non-transfected K562 cells. We further investigated the binding of recombinant MDC-L disintegrin domain (rDis-Fc) in solution. The rDis-Fc was found to bind to Jurkat cells in solution in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner. Both adhesion and solution binding of rDis-Fc was inhibited by the alpha(4)beta(1) ligand mimetic CS-1 peptide. Additionally, recognition of the MDC-L disintegrin domain required ""activation"" of lymphocyte beta(1) integrins. The interaction of MDC-L with alpha(4)beta(1) may potentially regulate metalloprotease function by targeting or sequestering the active protease on the cell surface. These results suggest a potential role for the lymphocyte ADAM, MDC-L, in the interaction of lymphocytes with alpha(4)beta(1)-expressing leukocytes.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
10799510,The lymphotoxin-beta receptor is necessary and sufficient for LIGHT-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells.,"LIGHT is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily member, which binds two known cellular receptors, lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTbetaR) and the herpesvirus entry mediator (HveA). LIGHT is a homotrimer that activates proapoptotic and integrin-inducing pathways. Receptor binding residues via LIGHT were identified by introducing point mutations in the A' --> A"" and D --> E loops of LIGHT, which altered binding to LTbetaR and HveA. One mutant of LIGHT exhibits selective binding to HveA and is inactive triggering cell death in HT29.14s cells or induction of ICAM-1 in fibroblasts. Studies with HveA- or LTbetaR-specific antibodies further indicated that HveA does not contribute, either cooperatively or by direct signaling, to the death pathway activated by LIGHT. LTbetaR, not HveA, recruits TNF receptor-associated factor-3 (TRAF3), and LIGHT-induced death is blocked by a dominant negative TRAF3 mutant. Together, these results indicate that TRAF3 recruitment propagates death signals initiated by LIGHT-LTbetaR interaction and implicates a distinct biological role for LIGHT-HveA system.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
7557266,The mammalian tachykinin receptors.,"The tachykinins (TKs) are a family of small peptides which share the common C-terminal sequence Phe-X-Gly-Leu-MetNH2. Three peptides of this family, substance P, neurokinin A and neurokinin B, have an established role as neurotransmitters in mammals. 2. Three receptors for TKs have been cloned: they are G-protein coupled receptors with seven putative transmembrane spanning segments and have been termed NK1 (substance P-preferring), NK2 (neurokinin A-preferring) and NK3 (neurokinin B-preferring). 3. Synthetic agonists are available to selectively stimulate only one receptor, while natural TKs can act as full agonist at each one of the three receptors, albeit at different concentrations. 4. A number of potent and selective antagonists, both peptide and nonpeptide in nature, have recently been developed. 5. The introduction of these ligands has revealed an unforeseen pharmacological heterogeneity of NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptors which appears largely, if not exclusively, linked to the existence of species homologues of the three receptors.",General pharmacology,1995
16025156,The matrix component biglycan is proinflammatory and signals through Toll-like receptors 4 and 2 in macrophages.,"Biglycan, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, is a ubiquitous ECM component; however, its biological role has not been elucidated in detail. Here we show that biglycan acts in macrophages as an endogenous ligand of TLR4 and TLR2, which mediate innate immunity, leading to rapid activation of p38, ERK, and NF-kappaB and thereby stimulating the expression of TNF-alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). In agreement, the stimulatory effects of biglycan are significantly reduced in TLR4-mutant (TLR4-M), TLR2-/-, and myeloid differentiation factor 88-/- (MyD88-/-) macrophages and completely abolished in TLR2-/-/TLR4-M macrophages. Biglycan-null mice have a considerable survival benefit in LPS- or zymosan-induced sepsis due to lower levels of circulating TNF-alpha and reduced infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lung, which cause less end-organ damage. Importantly, when stimulated by LPS-induced proinflammatory factors, macrophages themselves are able to synthesize biglycan. Thus, biglycan, upon release from the ECM or from macrophages, can boost inflammation by signaling through TLR4 and TLR2, thereby enhancing the synthesis of TNF-alpha and MIP-2. Our results provide evidence for what is, to our knowledge, a novel role of the matrix component biglycan as a signaling molecule and a crucial proinflammatory factor. These findings are potentially relevant for the development of new strategies in the treatment of sepsis.",,
16275757,The matrix protein CCN1 (CYR61) induces apoptosis in fibroblasts.,"Integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins is known to promote cell survival, whereas detachment from the matrix can cause rapid apoptotic death in some cell types. Contrary to this paradigm, we show that fibroblast adhesion to the angiogenic matrix protein CCN1 (CYR61) induces apoptosis, whereas endothelial cell adhesion to CCN1 promotes cell survival. CCN1 induces fibroblast apoptosis through its adhesion receptors, integrin alpha6beta1 and the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) syndecan-4, triggering the transcription-independent p53 activation of Bax to render cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9 and -3. Neither caspase-8 activity nor de novo transcription or translation is required for this process. These results show that cellular interaction with a specific matrix protein can either induce or suppress apoptosis in a cell type-specific manner and that integrin alpha6beta1-HSPGs can function as receptors to induce p53-dependent apoptosis.",The Journal of cell biology,2005
11041375,The melanocortin-1 receptor is a key regulator of human cutaneous pigmentation.,"The cloning and characterization of the human melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) and the demonstration that normal human melanocytes respond to the melanocortins, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), with increased proliferation and eumelanogenesis had put an end to a long-standing controversy about the role of melanocortins in regulating human cutaneous pigmentation. We have shown that alpha-MSH and ACTH bind the human MC1R with equal affinity, and are equipotent in their mitogenic and melanogenic effects on human melanocytes. We also showed that the activation of the MC1R is important for the melanogenic response of human melanocytes to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The MC1R is also the principal mediator of the inhibitory effects of agouti signaling protein (ASP) on melanogenesis. Expression of the MC1R is subject to regulation by its own ligands alpha-MSH and ACTH, as well as by UVR and endothelin-1. Recent studies that we conducted on the expression of MC1R variants by human melanocytes and the implications of these variants on the function of the MC1R revealed the following. Human melanocytes homozygous for Arg160Trp mutation in the MC1R demonstrated a significantly reduced response to alpha-MSH. Also, this culture responded poorly to ASP and exhibited an exaggerated cytotoxic response to UVR. Another culture, which was homozygous for Val92Met mutation in the MC1R, demonstrated a normal response to alpha-MSH. Heterozygous mutations that are frequently expressed in various melanocyte cultures did not disrupt MC1R function. These results begin to elucidate the significance of MC1R variants in the function of the receptor. Our data emphasize the significance of a normally functioning MC1R in the response of melanocytes to melanocortins, ASP, and UVR.",,
28846098,The metabolic effects of GDF15 are mediated by the orphan receptor GFRAL.,"Growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), also known as MIC-1, is a distant member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily and has been implicated in various biological functions, including cancer cachexia, renal and heart failure, atherosclerosis and metabolism. A connection between GDF15 and body-weight regulation was initially suggested on the basis of an observation that increasing GDF15 levels in serum correlated with weight loss in individuals with advanced prostate cancer. In animal models, overexpression of GDF15 leads to a lean phenotype, hypophagia and other improvements in metabolic parameters, suggesting that recombinant GDF15 protein could potentially be used in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the signaling and mechanism of action of GDF15 are poorly understood owing to the absence of a clearly identified cognate receptor. Here we report that GDNF-family receptor α-like (GFRAL), an orphan member of the GFR-α family, is a high-affinity receptor for GDF15. GFRAL binds to GDF15 in vitro and is required for the metabolic actions of GDF15 with respect to body weight and food intake in vivo in mice. Gfral",,
11457843,"The metastasis suppressor gene KiSS-1 encodes kisspeptins, the natural ligands of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR54.","Natural peptides displaying agonist activity on the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR54 were isolated from human placenta. These 54-, 14,- and 13-amino acid peptides, with a common RF-amide C terminus, derive from the product of KiSS-1, a metastasis suppressor gene for melanoma cells, and were therefore designated kisspeptins. They bound with low nanomolar affinities to rat and human GPR54 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells and stimulated PIP(2) hydrolysis, Ca(2+) mobilization, arachidonic acid release, ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation, and stress fiber formation but inhibited cell proliferation. Human GPR54 was highly expressed in placenta, pituitary, pancreas, and spinal cord, suggesting a role in the regulation of endocrine function. Stimulation of oxytocin secretion after kisspeptin administration to rats confirmed this hypothesis.",,
30566277,The molecular mechanism of pH-regulating C3d-CR2 interactions: Insights from molecular dynamics simulation.,"The interactions of complement receptor 2 (CR2) and the degradation fragment C3d of complement component C3 mediate the innate and adaptive immune systems. Due to the importance of C3d-CR2 interaction in the design of vaccines, many studies have indicated the interactions are pH-dependent. Moreover, C3d-CR2 interactions at pH 5.0 are unknown. To investigate the molecular mechanism of pH-regulating C3d-CR2 interaction, molecular dynamics simulations for C3d-CR2 complex in different pH are performed. Our results revealed that the protonation of His9 in C3d at pH 6.0 slightly weakens C3d-CR2 association as reducing pH from 7.4 to 6.0, initiated from a key hydrogen bond formed between Gly270 and His9 in C3d at pH 6.0. When reducing pH from 6.0 to 5.0, the protonation of His33 in C3d weakens C3d-SCR1 association by changing the hydrogen-bond network of Asp36, Glu37, and Glu39 in C3d with Arg13 in CR2. In addition, the protonation of His90 significantly enhances C3d-SCR2 association. This is because the enhanced hydrogen-bond interactions of His90 with Glu63 and Ser69 of the linker change the conformations of the linker, Cys112-Asn116 and Pro87-Gly91 regions. This study uncovers the molecular mechanism of the mediation of pH on C3d-CR2 interaction, which is valuable for vaccine design.",,
12054506,The motilin pharmacophore in CHO cells expressing the human motilin receptor.,"We performed a structure-activity study with the human motilin receptor, which was recently cloned from thyroid tissue. N-terminal fragments, Ala-analogs of motilin, and motilides were tested in a cell line that expresses the cloned human motilin receptor and apoaequorin. Full potency to induce calcium fluxes was obtained with N-terminal fragments of 14 amino acids. Motilin fragments 1-14 in which residues 1 (Phe), 4 (Ile), and 7 (Tyr) were replaced by Ala showed the largest reduction in potency. Only motilides with an enol configuration had markedly higher potencies compared to erythromycin A. The potencies to induce Ca(2+) fluxes correlated strongly with rabbit binding and contractility data, suggesting that the cloned receptor is indeed the motilin receptor, responsible for contractile effects. Conservation of the motilin pharmacophore in evolution indicates an important physiological role of motilin.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2002
10433822,The mouse SLIT family: secreted ligands for ROBO expressed in patterns that suggest a role in morphogenesis and axon guidance.,"The Slit gene encodes a secreted molecule essential for neural development in Drosophila embryos. Here we report the identification of three Slit homologues in the mouse. We demonstrate that the mouse SLIT1 protein can bind ROBO1, a transmembrane receptor implicated in axon guidance. Both whole-mount and section in situ hybridization studies reveal unique and complementary patterns of expression of the three mouse Slit genes and of Robo1, both within the central nervous system and in other developing tissues. The complementary expression patterns of Slit and Robo1 and their in vitro interaction suggest a ligand-receptor relationship. The expression of all three Slit genes in the floor plate suggests that they are likely to share the same functional properties with their Drosophila homologue in midline neural development and axon guidance. The complementary expression of Slit and Robo1 in different subdivisions of the somites suggests their possible function in axon pathfinding and neural crest cell migration. The unique expression pattern in limb and other organs indicates additional potential functions of the Slit gene family.",Developmental biology,1999
27595232,The mucin MUC1 modulates the tumor immunological microenvironment through engagement of the lectin Siglec-9.,"Siglec-9 is a sialic-acid-binding lectin expressed predominantly on myeloid cells. Aberrant glycosylation occurs in essentially all types of cancers and results in increased sialylation. Thus, when the mucin MUC1 is expressed on cancer cells, it is decorated by multiple short, sialylated O-linked glycans (MUC1-ST). Here we found that this cancer-specific MUC1 glycoform, through engagement of Siglec-9, 'educated' myeloid cells to release factors associated with determination of the tumor microenvironment and disease progression. Moreover, MUC1-ST induced macrophages to display a tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-like phenotype, with increased expression of the checkpoint ligand PD-L1. Binding of MUC1-ST to Siglec-9 did not activate the phosphatases SHP-1 or SHP-2 but, unexpectedly, induced calcium flux that led to activation of the kinases MEK-ERK. This work defines a critical role for aberrantly glycosylated MUC1 and identifies an activating pathway that follows engagement of Siglec-9.",,
17971293,The murine pan T cell marker CD96 is an adhesion receptor for CD155 and nectin-1.,"The CD155 ligand CD96 is an immunoglobulin-like protein tentatively allocated to the repertoire of human NK receptors. We report here that the CD96/CD155-interaction is preserved between man and mouse although both receptors are only moderately conserved in amino acid sequence. Moreover, murine CD96 (mCD96) binds to nectin-1, a receptor related to CD155. Applying newly generated monoclonal antibodies specifically recognizing mCD96, an expression profile is revealed resembling closely that of human CD96 (hCD96) on cells of hematopoietic origin. A panel of anti-mCD96 but also recently established anti-mCD155 antibodies effectively prevents formation of CD96/CD155-complexes. This was exploited to demonstrate that the only available receptor for mCD96 present on thymocytes is mCD155. Moreover, T cell adhesion to insect cells expressing mCD155 is blocked by these antibodies depending on the T cell subtype. These results suggest a function of the CD96/CD155-adhesion system in T cell biology.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2007

However, the nature and stoichiometry of the receptor-mediated interactions in this complex have not yet been fully resolved. We show here that signaling by CNTF, but not by LIF or oncostatin M (OSM), was abolished in cells overexpressing a LIFR mutant with the N-terminal cytokine binding domain deleted. Our results illustrate molecular differences between the CNTF active receptor complex and those of LIF and OSM and provide further support for the hexameric model of the CNTF receptor complex.",,
15841214,"The N-terminal domain of thrombomodulin sequesters high-mobility group-B1 protein, a novel antiinflammatory mechanism.","Thrombomodulin (TM) is an endothelial anticoagulant cofactor that promotes thrombin-mediated formation of activated protein C (APC). We have found that the N-terminal lectin-like domain (D1) of TM has unique antiinflammatory properties. TM, via D1, binds high-mobility group-B1 DNA-binding protein (HMGB1), a factor closely associated with necrotic cell damage following its release from the nucleus, thereby preventing in vitro leukocyte activation, in vivo UV irradiation-induced cutaneous inflammation, and in vivo lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality. Our data also demonstrate antiinflammatory properties of a peptide spanning D1 of TM and suggest its therapeutic potential. These findings highlight a novel mechanism, i.e., sequestration of mediators, through which an endothelial cofactor, TM, suppresses inflammation quite distinctly from its anticoagulant cofactor activity, thereby preventing the interaction of these mediators with cell surface receptors on effector cells in the vasculature.",The Journal of clinical investigation,2005

Domain VI alone, which corresponds to an LN module, did not represent an autonomously folding unit in mammalian cells, however. Fragment alpha1VI/V, but not fragment alpha1V, bound to purified alpha1beta1 and alpha2beta1 integrins, to heparin, and to heparan sulfate-substituted domains I and V of perlecan.

8760804,The natural killer cell receptor specific for HLA-A allotypes: a novel member of the p58/p70 family of inhibitory receptors that is characterized by three immunoglobulin-like domains and is expressed as a 140-kD disulphide-linked dimer.,"Human natural killer (NK) cells express inhibitory receptors that are specific for different groups of HLA-C or HLA-B alleles. The majority of these receptors belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and are characterized by two or three extracellular Ig-like domains. Here we describe a novel inhibitory NK receptor that is specific for a group of HLA-A alleles. The HLA-A3-specific NK cell clone DP7 has been used for mice immunization. Two mAbs, termed Q66 and Q241, bound to the immunizing clone and stained only a subset of NK cell populations or clones. Among Q66 mAb-reactive clones, we further selected those that did not express any of the previously identified HLA-class I-specific NK receptors. These clones did not lyse HLA-A3+ (or -A11+) target cells, but lysis of these targets could be detected in the presence of Q66 or Q241 mAbs. On the other hand, target cells expressing other HLA-A alleles, including -A1, -A2, and -A24, were efficiently lysed. Moreover, none of the HLA-C or HLA-B alleles that were tested exerted a protective effect. Q66+, but not Q66- NK cell clones, expressed messenger RNA coding for a novel 3 Ig domain protein homologous to the HLA-C (p58) and HLA-B (p70) receptors. The corresponding cDNA (cl.1.1) was used to generate transient and stable transfectants in COS7 and NIH3T3 cell lines, respectively. Both types of transfectants were specifically stained by Q66 and Q241 mAbs. Since the cytoplasmic tail of Q66-reactive molecules was at least 11 amino acid longer than the other known p58/p70 molecules, we could generate an antiserum specific for the COOH-terminus of Q66-reactive molecules, termed PGP-3. PGP-3 immunoprecipitated, only from Q66+ NK cells, molecules displaying a molecular mass of 140 kD, under nonreducing conditions, which resolved, under reducing conditions, in a 70-kD band. Thus, differently from the other p58/p70 receptors, Q66-reactive molecules appear to be expressed as disulphide-linked dimers and were thus termed p140. The comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences of p58, p70, and p140 molecules revealed the existence of two cysteins proximal to the transmembrane region, only in the amino acid sequence of p140 molecules.",,
12050162,The nephroblastoma overexpressed gene (NOV/ccn3) protein associates with Notch1 extracellular domain and inhibits myoblast differentiation via Notch signaling pathway.,"We demonstrate a novel interaction of the nephroblastoma overexpressed gene (NOV), a member of the CCN gene family, with the Notch signaling pathway. NOV associates with the epidermal growth factor-like repeats of Notch1 by the CT (C-terminal cysteine knot) domain. The promoters of HES1 and HES5, which are the downstream transducers of Notch signaling, were activated by NOV. Expressions of NOV and Notch1 were concomitant in the presomitic mesoderm and later in the myocytes and chondrocytes, suggesting their synergistic effects in mesenchymal cell differentiation. In C2/4 myogenic cells, elevated expression of NOV led to down-regulation of MyoD and myogenin, resulting in inhibition of myotube formation. These results indicate that NOV-Notch1 association exerts a positive effect on Notch signaling and consequently suppresses myogenesis.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
14595443,The netrin-G1 ligand NGL-1 promotes the outgrowth of thalamocortical axons.,"Netrin-G1 is a lipid-anchored protein that is structurally related to the netrin family of axon guidance molecules. Netrin-G1 does not bind any of the known netrin receptors and its function is not known. Here we identify human netrin-G1 ligand (NGL-1), a transmembrane protein containing leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) domains that specifically interacts with netrin-G1 through its LRR region. Whereas netrin-G1 is expressed highly in mouse thalamic axons, NGL-1 is most abundant in the striatum and the cerebral cortex--the intermediate and final targets, respectively, of thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Surface-bound NGL-1 stimulates, but soluble NGL-1 disrupts, the growth of embryonic thalamic axons, and in vitro data indicate that NGL-1 activity may be mediated at least partially by netrin-G1. Our findings provide evidence that netrin-G1 functions as an important component of the NGL-1 receptor to promote TCA outgrowth and that membrane-bound netrins can participate in receiving axonal signaling pathways.",,
12837245,The neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM is an alternative signaling receptor for GDNF family ligands.,"Intercellular communication involves either direct cell-cell contact or release and uptake of diffusible signals, two strategies mediated by distinct and largely nonoverlapping sets of molecules. Here, we show that the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM can function as a signaling receptor for members of the GDNF ligand family. Association of NCAM with GFRalpha1, a GPI-anchored receptor for GDNF, downregulates NCAM-mediated cell adhesion and promotes high-affinity binding of GDNF to p140(NCAM), resulting in rapid activation of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases Fyn and FAK in cells lacking RET, a known GDNF signaling receptor. GDNF stimulates Schwann cell migration and axonal growth in hippocampal and cortical neurons via binding to NCAM and activation of Fyn, but independently of RET. These results uncover an unexpected intersection between short- and long-range mechanisms of intercellular communication and reveal a pathway for GDNF signaling that does not require the RET receptor.",Cell,2003
11283023,"The neural recognition molecule L1 is a sialic acid-binding lectin for CD24, which induces promotion and inhibition of neurite outgrowth.","Among the recognition molecules that determine a neuron's interaction with other cells, L1 and CD24 have been suggested to cooperate with each other in neurite outgrowth and signal transduction. Here we report that binding of CD24 to L1 depends on alpha2,3-sialic acid on CD24, which determines the CD24 induced and cell type-specific promotion or inhibition of neurite outgrowth. Using knockout mutants, we could show that the CD24-induced effects on neurite outgrowth are mediated via L1, and not GPI-linked CD24, by trans-interaction of L1 with sialylated CD24. This glycoform is excluded together with L1 from raft microdomains, suggesting that molecular compartmentation in the surface membrane could play a role in signal transduction.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2001
34879110,The neutrophil protein CD177 is a novel PDPN receptor that regulates human cancer-associated fibroblast physiology.,"The cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) marker podoplanin (PDPN) is generally correlated with poor clinical outcomes in cancer patients and thus represents a promising therapeutic target. Despite its biomedical relevance, basic aspects of PDPN biology such as its cellular functions and cell surface ligands remain poorly uncharacterized, thus challenging drug development. Here, we utilize a high throughput platform to elucidate the PDPN cell surface interactome, and uncover the neutrophil protein CD177 as a new binding partner. Quantitative proteomics analysis of the CAF phosphoproteome reveals a role for PDPN in cell signaling, growth and actomyosin contractility, among other processes. Moreover, cellular assays demonstrate that CD177 is a functional antagonist, recapitulating the phenotype observed in PDPN-deficient CAFs. In sum, starting from the unbiased elucidation of the PDPN co-receptome, our work provides insights into PDPN functions and reveals the PDPN/CD177 axis as a possible modulator of fibroblast physiology in the tumor microenvironment.",,
17580308,The neutrophil-specific antigen CD177 is a counter-receptor for platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31).,"Human neutrophil-specific CD177 (NB1 and PRV-1) has been reported to be up-regulated in a number of inflammatory settings, including bacterial infection and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor application. Little is known about its function. By flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation studies, we identified platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) as a binding partner of CD177. Real-time protein-protein analysis using surface plasmon resonance confirmed a cation-dependent, specific interaction between CD177 and the heterophilic domains of PECAM-1. Monoclonal antibodies against CD177 and against PECAM-1 domain 6 inhibited adhesion of U937 cells stably expressing CD177 to immobilized PECAM-1. Transendothelial migration of human neutrophils was also inhibited by these antibodies. Our findings provide direct evidence that neutrophil-specific CD177 is a heterophilic binding partner of PECAM-1. This interaction may constitute a new pathway that participates in neutrophil transmigration.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2007
14734748,The nonclassical MHC class I molecule Qa-1 forms unstable peptide complexes.,"The MHC class Ib molecule Qa-1 is the primary ligand for mouse CD94/NKG2A inhibitory receptors expressed on NK cells, in addition to presenting Ags to a subpopulation of T cells. CD94/NKG2A receptors specifically recognize Qa-1 bound to the MHC class Ia leader sequence-derived peptide Qdm. Qdm is the dominant peptide loaded onto Qa-1 under physiological conditions and this peptide has an optimal sequence for binding to Qa-1. Peptide dissociation experiments demonstrated that Qdm dissociates from soluble or cell surface Qa-1(b) molecules with a t(1/2) of approximately 1.5 h at 37 degrees C. In comparison, complexes of an optimal peptide (SIINFEKL) bound to the MHC class Ia molecule H-2K(b) dissociated with a t(1/2) in the range from 11 to 31 h. In contrast to K(b), the stability of cell surface Qa-1(b) molecules was independent of bound peptides, and several observations suggested that empty cell surface Qa-1(b) molecules might be unusually stable. Consistent with the rapid dissociation rate of Qdm from Qa-1(b), cells become susceptible to lysis by CD94/NKG2A(+) NK cells under conditions in which new Qa-1(b)/Qdm complexes cannot be continuously generated at the cell surface. These results support the hypothesis that Qa-1 has been selected as a specialized MHC molecule that is unable to form highly stable peptide complexes. We propose that the CD94/NKG2A-Qa-1/Qdm recognition system has evolved as a rapid sensor of the integrity of the MHC class I biosynthesis and Ag presentation pathway.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2004
9430226,"The novel receptor TRAIL-R4 induces NF-kappaB and protects against TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, yet retains an incomplete death domain.","A fourth member of the emerging TRAIL receptor family, TRAIL-R4, has been cloned and characterized. TRAIL-R4 encodes a 386-amino acid protein with an extracellular domain showing 58%-70% identity to those of TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, and TRAIL-R3. The signaling capacity of TRAIL-R4 is similar to that of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 with respect to NF-kappaB activation, but differs in its inability to induce apoptosis. Yet TRAIL-R4 retains a C-terminal element containing one third of a consensus death domain motif. Transient overexpression of TRAIL-R4 in cells normally sensitive to TRAIL-mediated killing confers complete protection, suggesting that one function of TRAIL-R4 may be inhibition of TRAIL cytotoxicity. Like TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, this receptor shows widespread tissue expression. The human TRAIL-R4 gene has been mapped to chromosome 8p22-21, clustered with three other TRAIL receptors.",,
11773063,The orphan receptor C5L2 has high affinity binding sites for complement fragments C5a and C5a des-Arg(74).,"The substantial variations in the responses of cells to the anaphylatoxin C5a and its desarginated form, C5adR(74), suggest that more than one type of cell surface receptor for these ligands might exist. However, only a single receptor for C5a and C5adR(74), CD88, has been characterized to date. Here we report that the orphan receptor C5L2/gpr77, which shares 35% amino acid identity with CD88, binds C5a with high affinity but has a 10-fold higher affinity for C5adR(74) than CD88. C5L2 also has a moderate affinity for anaphylatoxin C3a, but cross-competition studies suggest that C3a binds to a distinct site from C5a. C4a was able to displace C3a, suggesting that C5L2, like the C3a receptor, may have a low binding affinity for this anaphylatoxin. Unlike CD88 and C3a receptor, C5L2 transfected into RBL-2H3 cells does not support degranulation or increases in intracellular [Ca(2+)] and is not rapidly internalized in response to ligand binding. However, ligation of C5L2 by anaphylatoxin did potentiate the degranulation response to cross-linkage of the high affinity IgE receptor by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. These results suggest that C5L2 is an anaphylatoxin-binding protein with unique ligand binding and signaling properties.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
15388793,The orphan receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 modulates canonical Wnt signaling in osteoblastic cells.,"Ror2 is an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase that plays crucial roles in developmental morphogenesis, particularly of the skeleton. We have identified human Ror2 as a novel regulator of canonical Wnt signaling in osteoblastic (bone-forming) cells with selective activities, enhancing Wnt1 but antagonizing Wnt3. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated physical interactions between human Ror2 and mammalian Wnt1 and Wnt3. Functionally, Ror2 antagonized Wnt1- and Wnt3-mediated stabilization of cytosolic beta-catenin in osteoblastic cells. However, Ror2 had opposing effects on a more distal step of canonical Wnt signaling: it potentiated Wnt1 activity but inhibited Wnt3 function as assessed by changes in Wnt-responsive reporter gene activity. Despite binding to Ror2, neither Wnt1 nor Wnt3 altered receptor activity as assessed by levels of Ror2 autophosphorylation. The ability of Ror2 to regulate canonical Wnt signaling in osteoblastic cells should have physiological consequences in bone, because Wnt signaling is known to modulate osteoblast survival and differentiation. Expression of Ror2 mRNA was highly regulated in a biphasic manner during human osteoblast differentiation, being virtually undetectable in pluripotent stem cells, increasing 300-fold in committed preosteoblasts, and disappearing again in osteocytes. Furthermore, Ror2 expression in osteoblasts was suppressed by the Wnt antagonist, secreted frizzled-related protein 1. The regulated expression of Ror2 during osteoblast differentiation, its inverse expression pattern with secreted frizzled-related protein 1, and its ability to modulate Wnt signaling in osteoblastic cells suggest that Ror2 may regulate bone formation.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",2005
30869196,The pattern-recognition molecule mindin binds integrin Mac-1 to promote macrophage phagocytosis via Syk activation and NF-κB p65 translocation.,"Mindin has a broad spectrum of roles in the innate immune system, including in macrophage migration, antigen phagocytosis and cytokine production. Mindin functions as a pattern-recognition molecule for microbial pathogens. However, the underlying mechanisms of mindin-mediated phagocytosis and its exact membrane receptors are not well established. Herein, we generated mindin-deficient mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system and show that peritoneal macrophages from mindin-deficient mice were severely defective in their ability to phagocytize E  coli. Phagocytosis was enhanced when E  coli or fluorescent particles were pre-incubated with mindin, indicating that mindin binds directly to bacteria or non-pathogen particles and promotes phagocytosis.

15207811,The PDGF family: four gene products form five dimeric isoforms.,"Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) were discovered more than two decades ago. Today the PDGF family of growth factors consists of five different disulphide-linked dimers built up of four different polypeptide chains encoded by four different genes. These isoforms, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, PDGF-CC and PDGF-DD, act via two receptor tyrosine kinases, PDGF receptors alpha and beta. The classic PDGFs, PDGF-A and PDGF-B, undergo intracellular activation during transport in the exocytic pathway for subsequent secretion, while the novel PDGFs, PDGF-C and PDGF-D, are secreted as latent factors that require activation by extracellular proteases. The classical PDGF polypeptide chains, PDGF-A and PDGF-B, are well studied and they regulate several physiological and pathophysiological processes, mainly using cells of mesenchymal or neuroectodermal origin as their targets. The discovery of two additional ligands for the two PDGF receptors suggests that PDGF-mediated cellular signaling is more complex than previously thought.",Cytokine & growth factor reviews,2004
11408607,The peptide YY-preferring receptor mediating inhibition of small intestinal secretion is a peripheral Y(2) receptor: pharmacological evidence and molecular cloning.,"A peptide YY (PYY)-preferring receptor [PYY > neuropeptide Y (NPY)] was previously characterized in rat small intestinal crypt cells, where it mediates inhibition of fluid secretion. Here, we investigated the possible status of this receptor as a peripheral Y(2) receptor in rats. Typical Y(2) agonists (PYY(3-36), NPY(3-36), NPY(13-36), C2-NPY) and very short PYY analogs (N-alpha-Ac-PYY(22-36) and N-alpha-Ac-PYY(25-36)) acting at the intestinal PYY receptor were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of (125)I-PYY to membranes of rat intestinal crypt cells and of CHO cells stably transfected with the rat hippocampal Y(2) receptor cDNA. Similar PYY preference was observed and all analogs exhibited comparable high affinity in both binding assays. The same held true for the specific Y(2) antagonist BIIE0246 with a K(i) value of 6.5 and 9.0 nM, respectively. BIIE0246 completely abolished the inhibition of cAMP production by PYY in crypt cells and transfected CHO cells. Moreover, the antagonist 1) considerably reversed the PYY-induced reduction of short-circuit current in rat jejunum mucosa in Ussing chamber and 2) completely abolished the antisecretory action of PYY on vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-induced fluid secretion in rat jejunum in vivo. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments showed that Y(2) receptor transcripts were present in intestinal crypt cells (3 x 10(2) molecules/100 ng RNA(T)) with no expression in villus cells, in complete agreement with the exclusive binding of PYY in crypt cells. Finally, a full-length Y(2) receptor was cloned by RT-PCR from rat intestinal crypt cells and also from human small intestine. We conclude that the so-called PYY-preferring receptor mediating inhibition of intestinal secretion is a peripheral Y(2) receptor.",Molecular pharmacology,2001
20956518,The peptidomimetic CXCR4 antagonist TC14012 recruits beta-arrestin to CXCR7: roles of receptor domains.,"CXCR7 is an atypical chemokine receptor that signals through β-arrestin in response to agonists without detectable activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Its cognate chemokine ligand CXCL12 also binds CXCR4, a chemokine receptor of considerable clinical interest. Here we report that TC14012, a peptidomimetic inverse agonist of CXCR4, is an agonist on CXCR7. The potency of β-arrestin recruitment to CXCR7 by TC14012 is much higher than that of the previously reported CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 and differs only by one log from that of the natural ligand CXCL12 (EC(50) 350 nM for TC14012, as compared with 30 nM for CXCL12 and 140 μM for AMD3100). Moreover, like CXCL12, TC14012 leads to Erk 1/2 activation in U373 glioma cells that express only CXCR7, but not CXCR4. Given that with TC14012 and AMD3100 two structurally unrelated CXCR4 antagonists turn out to be agonists on CXCR7, this likely reflects differences in the activation mechanism of the arrestin pathway by both receptors. To identify the receptor domain responsible for these opposed effects, we investigated CXCR4 and CXCR7 C terminus-swapping chimeras. Using quantitative bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, we find that the CXCR7 receptor core formed by the seven-transmembrane domains and the connecting loops determines the agonistic activity of both TC14012 and AMD3100. Moreover, we find that the CXCR7 chimera bearing the CXCR4 C-terminal constitutively associates with arrestin in the absence of ligands. Our data suggest that the CXCR4 and CXCR7 cores share ligand-binding surfaces for the binding of the synthetic ligands, indicating that CXCR4 inhibitors should be tested also on CXCR7.",,
19333378,The phospholipid scramblases 1 and 4 are cellular receptors for the secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor and interact with CD4 at the plasma membrane.,"Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is secreted by epithelial cells in all the mucosal fluids such as saliva, cervical mucus, as well in the seminal liquid. At the physiological concentrations found in saliva, SLPI has a specific antiviral activity against HIV-1 that is related to the perturbation of the virus entry process at a stage posterior to the interaction of the viral surface glycoprotein with the CD4 receptor. Here, we confirm that recombinant SLPI is able to inhibit HIV-1 infection of primary T lymphocytes, and show that SLPI can also inhibit the transfer of HIV-1 virions from primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells to autologous T lymphocytes. At the molecular level, we show that SLPI is a ligand for the phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) and PLSCR4, membrane proteins that are involved in the regulation of the movements of phospholipids between the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane. Interestingly, we reveal that PLSCR1 and PLSCR4 also interact directly with the CD4 receptor at the cell surface of T lymphocytes. We find that the same region of the cytoplasmic domain of PLSCR1 is involved in the binding to CD4 and SLPI. Since SLPI was able to disrupt the association between PLSCR1 and CD4, our data suggest that SLPI inhibits HIV-1 infection by modulating the interaction of the CD4 receptor with PLSCRs. These interactions may constitute new targets for antiviral intervention.",PloS one,2009
25354496,The Physiology of BDNF and Its Relationship with ADHD.,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a major neurotrophin in the central nervous system that plays a critical role in the physiological brain functions via its two independent receptors: tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) and p75, especially in the neurodevelopment. Disrupting of BDNF and its downstream signals has been found in many neuropsychological diseases, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a common mental disorder which is prevalent in childhood. Understanding the physiological functions of BDNF during neural development and its potential relationship with ADHD will help us to elucidate the possible mechanisms of ADHD and to develop therapeutic approaches for this disease. In this review, we summarized the important literatures for the physiological functions of BDNF in the neurodevelopment. We also performed an association study on the functional genetic variation of BDNF and ADHD by a case-control study in the Chinese mainland population and revealed the potential correlation between BDNF and ADHD which needs further research to confirm.",Molecular neurobiology,2015
11937491,The plexin-B1/Rac interaction inhibits PAK activation and enhances Sema4D ligand binding.,"The small GTPase Rac has been implicated in growth cone guidance mediated by semaphorins and their receptors. Here we demonstrate that plexin-B1, a receptor for Semaphorin4D (Sema4D), and p21-activated kinase (PAK) can compete for the interaction with active Rac and plexin-B1 can inhibit Rac-induced PAK activation. We have also demonstrated that expression of active Rac enhances the ability of plexin-B1 to interact with Sema4D. Active Rac stimulates the localization of plexin-B1 to the cell surface. The enhancement in Sema4D binding depends on the ability of Rac to bind plexin-B1. These observations support a model where signaling between Rac and plexin-B1 is bidirectional; Rac modulates plexin-B1 activity and plexin-B1 modulates Rac function.",,
11437656,The poliovirus receptor CD155 mediates cell-to-matrix contacts by specifically binding to vitronectin.,"The human receptor for poliovirus (CD155) is an immunoglobulin-like molecule with unknown normal function(s). Here we provide evidence that CD155 binds specifically to vitronectin with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 72 nM as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Based on sequence homology to the CD155 gene, three poliovirus receptor-related genes (PRR1, PRR2, and PRR3) were cloned recently. PRR proteins were reported by others to mediate homophilic cell adhesion. Neither PRR1 nor PRR2 binds poliovirus and it is assumed that their physiological functions differ from that of CD155. Indeed, mPRR2 was found to bind to vitronectin only weakly, while its self-adhesion activity is characterized by a K(d) of 310 nM. Moreover, there is no evidence for CD155 self-adhesion. Both CD155 and vitronectin colocalize to follicular dendritic cells and B cells inside the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid tissue (tonsils)-an observation suggesting that the CD155/vitronectin interaction is required for the establishment of a proper immune response in this particular context.",,
7592830,The promiscuous chemokine binding profile of the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines is primarily localized to sequences in the amino-terminal domain.,"The Duffy antigen (DARC) is a promiscuous chemokine receptor that also binds Plasmodium vivax. DARC belongs to a family of heptahelical chemokine receptors that includes specific (IL-8RA) and shared (IL-8RB) IL-8 receptors. Ligand binding specificity of IL-8 receptors was localized to the amino-terminal extracellular (E1) domain. To determine the basis for promiscuous chemokine binding by DARC, a chimeric receptor composed of the E1 domain of DARC and hydrophobic helices and loops from IL-8RB (DARCe1/IL-8RB) was constructed. Scatchard analysis of stable transfectants demonstrated that the DARCe1/IL-8RB chimeric receptor bound IL-8 and melanoma growth stimulating activity (MGSA) with KD values almost identical to the native receptors. The hybrid receptor also bound RANTES, MCP-1, and MGSA-E6A (which binds DARC, but not IL-8RB), but not MIP-1 alpha, similarly to DARC. Ligand binding to DARC transfectants was unaltered by anti-Fy3, but inhibited by Fy6, which binds an epitope in the E1 domain. The epitope recognized by Fy3 was localized to the third extracellular loop by analysis of insect cells expressing chimeric receptors composed of complementary portions of DARC and IL-8RB. These findings implicate the E1 domain of DARC in multispecific chemokine binding.",,
19359471,The protein disulfide isomerase AGR2 is essential for production of intestinal mucus.,"Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) aid protein folding and assembly by catalyzing formation and shuffling of cysteine disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Many members of the PDI family are expressed in mammals, but the roles of specific PDIs in vivo are poorly understood. A recent homology-based search for additional PDI family members identified anterior gradient homolog 2 (AGR2), a protein originally presumed to be secreted by intestinal epithelial cells. Here, we show that AGR2 is present within the ER of intestinal secretory epithelial cells and is essential for in vivo production of the intestinal mucin MUC2, a large, cysteine-rich glycoprotein that forms the protective mucus gel lining the intestine. A cysteine residue within the AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain forms mixed disulfide bonds with MUC2, indicating a direct role for AGR2 in mucin processing. Mice lacking AGR2 were viable but were highly susceptible to colitis, indicating a critical role for AGR2 in protection from disease. We conclude that AGR2 is a unique member of the PDI family, with a specialized and nonredundant role in intestinal mucus production.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2009
20133774,The protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPRZ and PTPRG bind to distinct members of the contactin family of neural recognition molecules.,"The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases gamma (PTPRG) and zeta (PTPRZ) are expressed primarily in the nervous system and mediate cell adhesion and signaling events during development. We report here the crystal structures of the carbonic anhydrase-like domains of PTPRZ and PTPRG and show that these domains interact directly with the second and third immunoglobulin repeats of the members of the contactin (CNTN) family of neural recognition molecules. Interestingly, these receptors exhibit distinct specificities: PTPRZ binds only to CNTN1, whereas PTPRG interacts with CNTN3, 4, 5, and 6. Furthermore, we present crystal structures of the four N-terminal immunoglobulin repeats of mouse CNTN4 both alone and in complex with the carbonic anhydrase-like domain of mouse PTPRG. In these structures, the N-terminal region of CNTN4 adopts a horseshoe-like conformation found also in CNTN2 and most likely in all CNTNs. This restrained conformation of the second and third immunoglobulin domains creates a binding site that is conserved among CNTN3, 4, 5, and 6. This site contacts a discrete region of PTPRG composed primarily of an extended beta-hairpin loop found in both PTPRG and PTPRZ. Overall, these findings implicate PTPRG, PTPRZ and CNTNs as a group of receptors and ligands involved in the manifold recognition events that underlie the construction of neural networks.",,

The recent progress in cDNA and genome DNA analyses has brought the discovery of numerous genes encoding ligand-unknown ""orphan"" 7TMRs. We have developed a strategy to identify the ligands of orphan 7TMRs by monitoring specific signal transductions induced in cells expressing orphan 7TMRs. Employing this method, we succeeded in identifying the natural ligands of the orphan 7TMRs, hGR3, and APJ. The ligand peptide identified for hGR3 was found to show a specific prolactin release promoting activity in rat anterior pituitary cells in in vitro culture and was therefore named ""prolactin-releasing peptide."" We named another novel bioactive peptide ""apelin,"" for ""APJ endogenous ligand."" Although the biological functions of apelin are still under investigation, APJ reportedly acts as a coreceptor in the process of human immunodeficiency virus infection. We believe that the identification of orphan 7TMR ligands will provide clues to reveal the unknown regulatory mechanisms of various physiological phenomena and opportunities for novel drug discovery in the future.","Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",1999
9278420,The receptor binding site of human interleukin-3 defined by mutagenesis and molecular modeling.,"Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a member of the cytokine superfamily that promotes multi-potential hematopoietic cell growth by interacting with a cell surface receptor composed of alpha and beta chains. The newly available three-dimensional structure of a variant of human (h) IL-3 allowed us to evaluate new and existing mutagenesis data and to rationally interpret the structure-function relationship of hIL-3 on a structural basis. The amino acid residues that were identified to be important for hIL-3 activity are grouped into two classes. The first class consists of largely hydrophobic residues required for the structural integrity of the protein, including the residues in IL-3 that are largely conserved among 10 mammalian species. These residues form the core of a scaffold for the second class of more rapidly diverging solvent-exposed residues, likely to be required for interaction with the receptor. Ten important and solvent-exposed residues, Asp21, Gly42, Glu43, Gln45, Asp46, Met49, Arg94, Pro96, Phe113, and Lys116, map to one side of the protein and form a putative binding site for the alpha subunit of the receptor. A model of the IL-3.IL-3 receptor complex based on the human growth hormone (hGH).hGH soluble receptor complex structure suggests that the interface between IL-3 and the IL-3 receptor alpha subunit consists of a cluster of hydrophobic residues flanked by electrostatic interactions. Although the IL-3/IL-3 receptor beta subunit interface cannot be uniquely located due to the lack of sufficient experimental data, several residues of the beta subunit that may interact with Glu22 of IL-3 are proposed. The role of these residues can be tested in future mutagenesis studies to define the interaction between IL-3 and IL-3 receptor beta subunit.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997

Unlike Fas, TNFR-1, and DR3, DR4 could not use FADD to transmit the death signal, suggesting the use of distinct proximal signaling machinery.

3031025,The receptor-binding sequence of urokinase. A biological function for the growth-factor module of proteases.,"Previous studies have shown that the region of human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) responsible for receptor binding resides in the amino-terminal fragment (ATF, residues 1-135) (Stoppelli, M.P., Corti, A., Soffientini, A., Cassani, G., Blasi, F., and Assoian, R.K. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 82, 4939-4943). The area within ATF responsible for specific receptor binding has now been identified by the ability of different synthetic peptides corresponding to different regions of the amino terminus of uPA to inhibit receptor binding of 125I-labeled ATF. A peptide corresponding to human [Ala19]uPA-(12-32) resulted in 50% inhibition of ATF binding at 100 nM. Peptides uPA-(18-32) and [Ala13]uPA-(9-20) inhibit at 100 and 2000 microM, respectively. The human peptide uPA-(1-14) and the mouse peptide [Ala20]uPA-(13-33) have no effect on ATF receptor binding. This region of uPA is referred to as the growth factor module since it shares partial amino acid sequence homology (residues 14-33) to epidermal growth factor (EGF). Furthermore, this region of EGF is responsible for binding of EGF to its receptor (Komoriya, A. Hortsch, M., Meyers, C., Smith, M., Kanety, H., and Schlessinger, J. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 1351-1355). However, EGF does not inhibit ATF receptor binding. Comparison of the sequences responsible for receptor binding of uPA and EGF indicate that the region of highest homology is between residues 13-19 and 14-20 of human uPA and EGF, respectively. In addition, there is a conservation of the spacings of four cysteines in this module whereas there is no homology between residues 20-30 and 21-33 of uPA and EGF. Thus, residues 20-30 of uPA apparently confer receptor binding specificity, and residues 13-19 provide the proper conformation to the adjacent binding region.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1987
24658051,The receptors CD96 and CD226 oppose each other in the regulation of natural killer cell functions.,"CD96, CD226 (DNAM-1) and TIGIT belong to an emerging family of receptors that interact with nectin and nectin-like proteins. CD226 activates natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity, whereas TIGIT reportedly counterbalances CD226. In contrast, the role of CD96, which shares the ligand CD155 with CD226 and TIGIT, has remained unclear. In this study we found that CD96 competed with CD226 for CD155 binding and limited NK cell function by direct inhibition. As a result, Cd96(-/-) mice displayed hyperinflammatory responses to the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and resistance to carcinogenesis and experimental lung metastases. Our data provide the first description, to our knowledge, of the ability of CD96 to negatively control cytokine responses by NK cells. Blocking CD96 may have applications in pathologies in which NK cells are important.",,
10837471,The role of alpha and beta chains in ligand recognition by beta 7 integrins.,"Integrins alpha(E)beta(7) and alpha(4)beta(7) are involved in localization of leukocytes at mucosal sites. Although both alpha(E)beta(7) and alpha(4)beta(7) utilize the beta(7) chain, they have distinct binding specificities for E-cadherin and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), respectively. We found that mutation of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in the alpha(E) A-domain (D190A) abolished E-cadherin binding, as did mutation F298A on the A-domain surface near the MIDAS cleft. A docking model of the A-domain with E-cadherin domain 1 indicates that coordination of the alpha(E) MIDAS metal ion by E-cadherin Glu(31) and a novel projection of Phe(298) into a hydrophobic pocket on E-cadherin provide the basis for the interaction. The location of the binding site on the alpha(E) A-domain resembles that on other integrins, but its structure appears distinctive and particularly adapted to recognize the tip of E-cadherin, a unique integrin ligand. Additionally, mutation of the beta(7) MIDAS motif (D140A) abolished alpha(E)beta(7) binding to E-cadherin and alpha(4)beta(7)-mediated adhesion to MAdCAM-1, and alpha(4) chain mutations that abrogated binding of alpha(4)beta(1) to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and fibronectin similarly reduced alpha(4)beta(7) interaction with MAdCAM-1. Thus, although specificity can be determined by the integrin alpha or beta chain, common structural features of both subunits are required for recognition of dissimilar ligands.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
9361795,The role of apocrine released proteins in the post-testicular regulation of human sperm function.,"A unifying hypothesis is presented postulating an apocrine release of several seminal proteins which mix and reaggregate in seminal fluid, thereby eventually forming particles designated either as ""prostasomes"", ""vesiculosomes"" or ""seminosomes"". The term ""aposomes"" should be restricted to the blebs released from secretory cells in the rat dorsal prostate and coagulating gland. Three different proteins present in human seminosomes along with the respective antibodies have been used to identify the localization, function and hypothetical interaction with spermatozoa. The proteins were (1) seminal vesicle-derived fibronectin, (2) prostate-derived 5'-nucleotidase and (3) a hitherto unidentified 100 kD membrane protein from epididymis, seminal vesicle and prostate. I. Fibronectin is an extracellular matrix protein which is also secreted from the seminal vesicles participating in the formation of the seminal clot. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy revealed a relatively broad distribution pattern of fibronectin immunoreactivity on spermatozoa from different donors. Adding a fibronectin antiserum at a moderate dilution to vital spermatozoa in vitro resulted in a significant increase in sperm motility. Purified plasma fibronectin added at various concentrations to a vital sperm preparation was found to inhibit sperm motility in a dose-dependent manner. Measurement of calcium fluxes in individual sperm in the presence of fibronectin showed a significant increase. These findings point to a possible post-testicular regulatory function of seminal fibronectin. 2.5'-Nucleotidase (5'-NT) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes nucleotides such as AMP or IMP into inorganic phosphate and the respective nucleoside. The highest amount and activity of 5'-nucleotidase was present in glandular cells of the prostate; much less was detected in seminal vesicles and epididymis. On spermatozoa, the enzyme was localized on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane covering the acrosomal region. Addition of purified enzyme to an in vitro incubation system of spermatozoa had no effect on sperm motility. A slight reduction of overall motility, however, was observed after addition of 5'-NT antibody to the spermatozoa. When 5'-nucleotidase inhibitors and adenosine channel antagonists were added to the sperm incubation system, a clear-cut inhibition of sperm motility occurred in a dose-dependent manner. This result is interpreted as indicating a significant role of ecto-5'-nucleotidase in the regulation of sperm motility. 3. A polyvalent antiserum against native human prostasomes recognized antigens in the range of 10-14 kD and of approximately 100 kD, respectively, in seminal fluid and prostate homogenates. Immunohistochemical studies revealed the presence of respective antigens in the epididymis, seminal vesicles and the prostate. Immunoelectron microscopy of ultracryo-sections showed labeling both of the apical plasma membrane in the prostate, as well as intraluminal secretory particles indicating the apocrine i.e. plasma-membrane bounded release of these particles. The secretory elements are termed ""seminosomes"". An affinity-purified fraction within the antiserum recognizes a 100 kD protein which is present both in the apical plasma membrane of the male genital glands, but also in the sperm head and principal piece of human spermatozoa. Incubation of spermatozoa with seminosomes and the respective purified antiserum had no effect on sperm motility. This is in contradistinction to former reports on motility increase induced by the so-called prostasomes.",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,1997
12194978,"The role of Grp 78 in alpha 2-macroglobulin-induced signal transduction. Evidence from RNA interference that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein is associated with, but not necessary for, GRP 78-mediated signal transduction.","The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a scavenger receptor that binds to many proteins, some of which trigger signal transduction. Receptor-recognized forms of alpha(2)-Macroglobulin (alpha(2)M*) bind to LRP, but the pattern of signal transduction differs significantly from that observed with other LRP ligands. For example, neither Ni(2+) nor the receptor-associated protein, which blocks binding of all known ligands to LRP, block alpha(2)M*-induced signal transduction. In the current study, we employed alpha(2)-macroglobulin (alpha(2)M)-agarose column chromatography to purify cell surface membrane binding proteins from 1-LN human prostate cancer cells and murine macrophages. The predominant binding protein purified from 1-LN prostate cancer cells was Grp 78 with small amounts of LRP, a fact that is consistent with our previous observations that there is little LRP present on the surface of these cells. The ratio of LRP:Grp 78 is much higher in macrophages. Flow cytometry was employed to demonstrate the presence of Grp 78 on the cell surface of 1-LN cells. Purified Grp 78 binds to alpha(2)M* with high affinity (K(d) approximately 150 pm). A monoclonal antibody directed against Grp 78 both abolished alpha(2)M*-induced signal transduction and co-precipitated LRP. Ligand blotting with alpha(2)M* showed binding to both Grp 78 and LRP heavy chains in these preparations. Use of RNA interference to silence LRP expression had no effect on alpha(2)M*-mediated signaling. We conclude that Grp 78 is essential for alpha(2)M*-induced signal transduction and that a ""co-receptor"" relationship exists with LRP like that seen with several other ligands and receptors such as the uPA/uPAR (urinary type plasminogen activator or urokinase/uPA receptor) system.",,
8382034,The role of histidine-1 in glucagon action.,"The identification of position 9 aspartic acid in glucagon as a critical residue for transduction reinforced the notion that specific residues in the peptide sequence dictate either receptor recognition or biological activity. It was evident from our studies that Asp9 operates in conjunction with His1 as part of the activation mechanism that follows binding to the glucagon receptor. This investigation was conducted to delineate structural features of histidine that contribute to its role in glucagon action. We report, based on binding and activity data from 10 replacement analogs, that the imidazole ring of His1 furnishes an aromatic determinant for receptor binding affinity and that its protonatable imidazole nitrogen is important for transduction.",Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,1993
27614294,The role of laminins in the organization and function of neuromuscular junctions.,"The synapse between motor neurons and skeletal muscle is known as the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Proper alignment of presynaptic and post-synaptic structures of motor neurons and muscle fibers, respectively, is essential for efficient motor control of skeletal muscles. The synaptic cleft between these two cells is filled with basal lamina. Laminins are heterotrimer extracellular matrix molecules that are key members of the basal lamina. Laminin α4, α5, and β2 chains specifically localize to NMJs, and these laminin isoforms play a critical role in maintenance of NMJs and organization of synaptic vesicle release sites known as active zones. These individual laminin chains exert their role in organizing NMJs by binding to their receptors including integrins, dystroglycan, and voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Disruption of these laminins or the laminin-receptor interaction occurs in neuromuscular diseases including Pierson syndrome and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Interventions to maintain proper level of laminins and their receptor interactions may be insightful in treating neuromuscular diseases and aging related degeneration of NMJs.",,
12007532,The role of melanocortins in body weight regulation: opportunities for the treatment of obesity.,"Five G-protein-coupled melanocortin receptors (MC(1)-MC(5)) are expressed in mammalian tissues. The melanocortin receptors support diverse physiological functions, including the regulation of hair color, adrenal function, energy homeostasis, feed efficiency, sebaceous gland lipid production and immune and sexual function. The melanocortins (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), beta-MSH and gamma-MSH) are agonist peptide ligands for the melanocortin receptors and these peptides are processed from the pre-prohormone proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Peptide antagonists for the melanocortin MC(1), MC(3) and MC(4) receptors include agouti-related protein (AgRP) and agouti. Diverse lines of evidence, including genetic and pharmacological data obtained in rodents and humans, support a role for the melanocortin MC(3) and MC(4) receptors in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Recent advances in the development of potent and selective peptide and non-peptide melanocortin receptor ligands are anticipated to help unravel the roles for the melanocortin receptors in humans and to accelerate the clinical use of small molecule melanocortin mimetics.",European journal of pharmacology,2002

9272936,"The role of tachykinin receptor antagonists in the prevention of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation and cough.","Several recent observations suggest that tachykinins, such as substance P and neurokinin A, might be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary alterations. Progress in investigations on the physiological and pathological roles of tachykinins has been greatly facilitated by the availability of a number of highly selective nonpeptide antagonists for tachykinin neurokinin 1, 2 and 3 (NK1, NK2 and NK3) receptors. The use of selective tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonists suggests that tachykinin NK2 receptor stimulation plays an important role in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness in the guinea-pig. Others studies have also indicated that tachykinin NK1-receptors are involved in immediate or delayed neurogenic inflammation including microvascular leakage and the subsequent increase in plasma protein extravasation. A role for the sensory neuropeptide system has also been proposed in cough, as shown by the observation that the antitussive effect of tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonists has clearly been demonstrated in several experimental conditions, but the effect of tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonists is still debated. Taken together, the results obtained with the various selective receptor antagonists provide pharmacological evidence that tachykinins play a role in delayed bronchopulmonary alterations and suggest that tachykinin receptor antagonists may be useful for investigating mechanisms and possibly reducing airway functional alterations in asthmatic patients.",,
12212791,The role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1) in Alzheimer's A beta generation: development of a cell-based model system.,"The clearance and degradation of extracellular A beta is critical for regulating beta-amyloid deposition, a major hallmark of brains of patients with A beta in Alzheimer's Disease. The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, LRP1, is a large endocytic receptor that significantly contributes to the balance between degradation and production of A beta. An extracellular portion of the LRP, known as the cluster II region can bind to the secreted form of APP (sAPP-KPI). We show here that a GST fusion protein containing the cluster II region of LRP can be used as a 'mini-receptor' that specifically binds to sAPP-KPI from conditioned cultured medium. The binding between the GST-LRP-cluster II fusion protein and sAPP-KPI can be inhibited with the strong binding ligand of LRP1, called receptor-associated protein (RAP). Furthermore, a cell-based in vitro assay system has been developed to monitor the production of total A beta and A beta(1-42) in the presence and absence of RAP in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines both deficient in LRP and expressing LRP. A 3-day treatment of the L2 (CHO cells deficient in LRP and overexpressing APP751) and L3 (CHO cells expressing LRP and overexpressing APP751) cell lines with RAP showed a decrease in total A beta and, interestingly, also a decrease in the ratio of A beta42/A beta(total). This cell-based model system and LRP-cluster II mini-receptor will be very useful for screening novel compounds that can reduce A beta accumulation by inhibiting binding of APP-KPI to LRP1.",,
18227064,The SALM family of adhesion-like molecules forms heteromeric and homomeric complexes.,"Synaptic adhesion-like molecules (SALMs) are a newly discovered family of adhesion molecules that play roles in synapse formation and neurite outgrowth. The SALM family is comprised of five homologous molecules that are expressed largely in the central nervous system. SALMs 1-3 contain PDZ-binding domains, whereas SALMs 4 and 5 do not. We are interested in characterizing the interactions of the SALMs both among the individual members and with other binding partners. In the present study, we focused on the interactions formed by the five SALM members in rat brain and heterologous cells. In brain, we found that SALMs 1-3 strongly co-immunoprecipitated with each other, whereas SALMs 4 and 5 did not, suggesting that SALMs 4 and 5 mainly form homomeric complexes. In heterologous cells transfected with SALMs, co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that all five SALMs form heteromeric and homomeric complexes. We also determined if SALMs could form trans-cellular associations between transfected heterologous cells. Both SALMs 4 and 5 formed homophilic, but not heterophilic associations, whereas no trans associations were formed by the other SALMs. The ability of SALM4 to form trans interactions is due to its extracellular N terminus because chimeras of SALM4 N terminus and SALM2 C terminus can form trans interactions, whereas chimeras of SALM2 N terminus and SALM4 C terminus cannot. Co-culture experiments using HeLa cells and rat hippocampal neurons expressing the SALMs showed that SALM4 is recruited to points of contact between the cells. In neurons, these points of contact were seen in both axons and dendrites.",,
12198496,The semaphorin 4D receptor controls invasive growth by coupling with Met.,"Semaphorins are cell surface and soluble signals that control axonal guidance. Recently, semaphorin receptors (plexins) have been discovered and shown to be widely expressed. Their biological activities outside the nervous system and the signal transduction mechanism(s) they utilize are largely unknown. Here, we show that in epithelial cells, Semaphorin 4D (Sema 4D) triggers invasive growth, a complex programme that includes cell#150;cell dissociation, anchorage-independent growth and branching morphogenesis. Interestingly, the same response is also controlled by scatter factors through their tyrosine kinase receptors, which share striking structural homology with plexins in their extracellular domain. We found that in cells expressing the endogenous proteins, Plexin B1 (the Sema 4D Receptor) and Met (the Scatter Factor 1/ Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor) associate in a complex. In addition, binding of Sema 4D to Plexin B1 stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity of Met, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of both receptors. Finally, cells lacking Met expression do not respond to Sema 4D unless exogenous Met is expressed. This work identifies a novel biological function of semaphorins and suggests the involvement of an unexpected signalling mechanism, namely, the coupling of a plexin to a tyrosine kinase receptor.",Nature cell biology,2002
18599270,The signalling profile of recombinant human orexin-2 receptor.,"Orexin-A and orexin-B orchestrate their diverse central and peripheral effects via two G-protein coupled receptors, OX1R and OX2R, which activate multiple G-proteins. In many tissues, orexins activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK(1/2)) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); however, the mechanism by which OX2R alone mediates MAPK activation is not understood. This study describes the intracellular signalling pathways involved in OX2R-mediated ERK(1/2) and p38 MAPK activation. In HEK-293 cells stably over-expressing recombinant human OX2R, orexin-A/B resulted in a rapid, dose and time dependent increase in activation of ERK(1/2) and p38 MAPK, with maximal activation at 10 min for ERK(1/2) and 30 min for p38 MAPK. Using dominant-negative G-proteins and selective inhibitors of intracellular signalling cascades, we determined that orexin-A and orexin-B induced ERK(1/2) and p38 MAPK activation through multiple G-proteins and different intracellular signalling pathways. ERK(1/2) activation involves Gq/phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), Gs/adenylyl cyclase (AC)/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and Gi cascades; however, the Gq/PLC/PKC pathway, as well as PKA is not required for OX2R-mediated p38 MAPK activation. Interestingly, orexin-B-induced ERK(1/2) activation is predominantly mediated through the Gq/PLC/PKC pathway. In conclusion, this is the first comprehensive signalling study of the human OX2R recombinant receptor, showing ERK(1/2) and p38 MAPK activation are regulated by differential signalling pathways in HEK-293 cells, and that the ERK(1/2) activation is severely affected by naturally occurring mutants associated with narcolepsy. Moreover, it is evident that the human OX2R has ligand specific effects, with orexin-B being more potent in this transfected system and this distinct modulation of the MAPKs through OX2R, may translate to the regulation of diverse biological actions of orexins.",Cellular signalling,2008
30321499,The soluble ligand Y box-1 activates Notch3 receptor by binding to epidermal growth factor like repeats 20-23.,"The transduction of signal by the Notch receptors to the intracellular domain is highly regulated and relies on binding of the ligands to the Epidermal growth factor Like Repeats (ELRs) of receptor's extracellular domain. Both canonical and non-canonical ligands are known to interact with different ELRs and activate Notch receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction of a soluble non-canonical ligand, Y box-1 (Yb-1) with Notch3 receptor ELRs. Polyclonal antibodies were employed as novel tools to identify the binding site of this ligand. Using various ligand binding and signaling assays, soluble Yb-1 was found to interact specifically with the Notch3 receptor, but not with Notch1. The ELRs 17-24 of Notch3 were identified as the binding site for Yb-1. Further, Yb-1 and Notch3 ELRs 17-24 structures were modelled and the Yb-1-Notch3 interaction interface was predicted to be Notch3 ELRs 20-23. Binding of the Yb-1 with Notch3 ELRs different from those reported for canonical DSL ligands also transduced the signal to the intracellular domain through the negative regulatory region. In conclusion, study highlights the importance of molecular modifications in different Notch3 ELRs for the transduction of signal to the negative regulatory region.",,
24453941,The sphingolipid receptor S1PR2 is a receptor for Nogo-a repressing synaptic plasticity.,"Nogo-A is a membrane protein of the central nervous system (CNS) restricting neurite growth and synaptic plasticity via two extracellular domains: Nogo-66 and Nogo-A-Δ20. Receptors transducing Nogo-A-Δ20 signaling remained elusive so far. Here we identify the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) as a Nogo-A-Δ20-specific receptor. Nogo-A-Δ20 binds S1PR2 on sites distinct from the pocket of the sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and signals via the G protein G13, the Rho GEF LARG, and RhoA. Deleting or blocking S1PR2 counteracts Nogo-A-Δ20- and myelin-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth and cell spreading. Blockade of S1PR2 strongly enhances long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus of wild-type but not Nogo-A(-/-) mice, indicating a repressor function of the Nogo-A/S1PR2 axis in synaptic plasticity. A similar increase in LTP was also observed in the motor cortex after S1PR2 blockade. We propose a novel signaling model in which a GPCR functions as a receptor for two structurally unrelated ligands, a membrane protein and a sphingolipid. Elucidating Nogo-A/S1PR2 signaling platforms will provide new insights into regulation of synaptic plasticity.",,
7721889,The structural basis for the specificity of epidermal growth factor and heregulin binding.,"Heregulin is a ligand for the erbB3 and erbB4 receptors, with a region of high homology to epidermal growth factor (EGF). Despite this homology, these ligands bind to their corresponding receptors with great specificity. We report here the synthesis of heregulin beta 177-241 and show that a region consisting of amino acids 177-226 is sufficient both for binding and stimulation of receptor phosphorylation. Studies of chimeric EGF/heregulin peptides revealed that amino acids 177-181 of heregulin provide the specificity for binding to the heregulin receptor. The substitution of amino acids 177-181 of heregulin for the N terminus of EGF produced a unique bifunctional agonist that binds with high affinity to both the EGF receptor and the heregulin receptor.",,

16172256,The structure of human CD23 and its interactions with IgE and CD21.,"The low-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor, CD23 (FcepsilonRII), binds both IgE and CD21 and, through these interactions, regulates the synthesis of IgE, the antibody isotype that mediates the allergic response. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the C-type lectin domain of CD23 in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. An analysis of concentration-dependent chemical shift perturbations have allowed us to identify the residues engaged in self-association to the trimeric state, whereas ligand-induced changes have defined the binding sites for IgE and CD21. The results further reveal that CD23 can bind both ligands simultaneously. Despite the C-type lectin domain structure, none of the interactions require calcium. We also find that IgE and CD23 can interact to form high molecular mass multimeric complexes. The interactions that we have described provide a solution to the paradox that CD23 is involved in both up- and down-regulation of IgE and provide a structural basis for the development of inhibitors of allergic disease.",The Journal of experimental medicine,2005
12149255,The structure of human macrophage inflammatory protein-3alpha /CCL20. Linking antimicrobial and CC chemokine receptor-6-binding activities with human beta-defensins.,"Human macrophage inflammatory protein-3alpha (MIP-3alpha; CCL20) is a CC-type chemokine that binds to and activates CC chemokine receptor-6 (CCR6). Although MIP-3alpha does not share the binding site of CCR6 with any other chemokine, human beta-defensin-1 and -2, small cationic antimicrobial peptides, have also been found to bind to and activate CCR6. Conversely, we have found that MIP-3alpha possesses antibacterial activity of greater potency than human beta-defensin-1 and -2 against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, while having no activity against the fungus Candida albicans. There is no clear sequence similarity between beta-defensins and the chemokine MIP-3alpha, beyond an abundance of cationic residues and the presence of disulfide bonds. Nonetheless, there are structural similarities between these three proteins that allow their overlap of chemotactic and antimicrobial activities. In this report, we describe the x-ray crystal structure of human MIP-3alpha refined to a resolution of 1.7 A and compare it with the crystal structures of human beta-defensin-1 and -2. Molecules of MIP-3alpha and the beta-defensins seem to share few structural motifs that are likely associated with their common biological activities.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
9294130,The syndecan family of proteoglycans. Novel receptors mediating internalization of atherogenic lipoproteins in vitro.,"Cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been shown to participate in lipoprotein catabolism, but the roles of specific proteoglycan classes have not been examined previously. Here, we studied the involvement of the syndecan proteoglycan family. First, transfection of CHO cells with expression vectors for several syndecan core proteins produced parallel increases in the cell association and degradation of lipoproteins enriched in lipoprotein lipase, a heparan-binding protein. Second, a chimeric construct, FcR-Synd1, that consists of the ectodomain of the IgG Fc receptor Ia linked to the highly conserved transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of syndecan-1 directly mediated efficient internalization, in a process triggered by ligand clustering. Third, internalization of lipase-enriched lipoproteins via syndecan-1 and of clustered IgGs via the chimera showed identical kinetics (t1/2 = 1 h) and identical dose-response sensitivities to cytochalasin B, which disrupts microfilaments, and to genistein, which inhibits tyrosine kinases. In contrast, internalization of the receptor-associated protein, which proceeds via coated pits, showed a t1/2 < 15 min, limited sensitivity to cytochalasin B, and complete insensitivity to genistein. Thus, syndecan proteoglycans can directly mediate ligand catabolism through a pathway with characteristics distinct from coated pits, and might act as receptors for atherogenic lipoproteins and other ligands in vivo.",,
9169480,The T cell-directed CC chemokine TARC is a highly specific biological ligand for CC chemokine receptor 4.,"Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) is a recently identified CC chemokine that is expressed constitutively in thymus and transiently in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. TARC functions as a selective chemoattractant for T cells that express a class of receptors binding TARC with high affinity and specificity. To identify the receptor for TARC, we produced TARC as a fusion protein with secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and used it for specific binding. By stably transfecting five orphan receptors and five known CC chemokine receptors (CCR1 to -5) into K562 cells, we found that TARC-SEAP bound selectively to cells expressing CCR4. TARC-SEAP also bound to K562 cells stably expressing CCR4 with a high affinity (Kd = 0.5 nM). Only TARC and not five other CC chemokines (MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted), MIP-1alpha (macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha), MIP-1beta, and LARC (liver and activation-regulated chemokine)) competed with TARC-SEAP for binding to CCR4. TARC but not RANTES or MIP-1alpha induced migration and calcium mobilization in 293/EBNA-1 cells stably expressing CCR4. K562 cells stably expressing CCR4 also responded to TARC in a calcium mobilization assay. Northern blot analysis revealed that CCR4 mRNA was expressed strongly in human T cell lines and peripheral blood T cells but not in B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, or granulocytes. Taken together, TARC is a specific functional ligand for CCR4, and CCR4 is the specific receptor for TARC selectively expressed on T cells.",,
2126341,The testicular receptor for follicle stimulating hormone: structure and functional expression of cloned cDNA.,"Cloned cDNA encoding the rat Sertoli cell receptor for FSH was isolated from a cognate library and functionally expressed in cultured mammalian cells. The FSH receptor (FSH-R), as predicted from the cDNA, is a single 75K polypeptide with a 348 residue extracellular domain which contains three N-linked glycosylation sites. This domain is connected to a structure containing seven putative transmembrane segments which displays sequence similarity to G protein-coupled receptors. Thus, the FSH-R is identical in its structural design to the LH/CG receptor (LH/CG-R). Furthermore, both receptors display 50% sequence similarity in their large extracellular domains and 80% identity across the seven transmembrane segments. Expression of the cloned cDNA in mammalian cells conferred FSH-dependent cAMP accumulation. The selectivity for FSH is attested by the fact that the related human glycoprotein hormones human CG and human TSH do not stimulate adenylyl cyclase in FSH-R expressing cells even when these hormones are present at high concentrations.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",1990
9794253,The thyrotropin-releasing hormone-receptor complex and G11alpha are both internalised into clathrin-coated vesicles.,"It has been proposed that, after agonist binding, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) becomes internalised associated with Gq, as part of a TRH-TRHR-Gq ternary complex [13]. We tested this hypothesis directly by examining the intracellular distribution of the TRHR and Gq/11 after agonist binding. The localisation of the TRH-TRHR complex and Gq/11alpha was studied by the biochemical isolation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). The internalised TRH-TRHR complex was localised in CCVs. The CCVs, which had internalised [3H]MeTRH, contained 4-fold higher levels of radiolabelled ligand than did CCVs from cells incubated with [3H]MeTRH at 4 degrees C. Like the receptor-ligand (RL) complex, G11alpha also translocated to these endocytic vesicles. For example, CCVs from cells with internalised TRH-TRHR complexes contained G11alpha, whereas CCVs from cells without internalised RL complexes lacked G11alpha. We conclude that, after agonist-induced TRHR-G11alpha coupling, both the TRH-TRHR complex and G11alpha are internalised in CCVs.",,
19329438,The traffic of the NKG2D/Dap10 receptor complex during natural killer (NK) cell activation.,"NKG2D is an important activating receptor for triggering the NK cell cytotoxic activity, although chronic engagement of specific ligands by NKG2D is also known to provoke decreased cell surface expression of the receptor and compromised NK cell function. We have studied the dynamics of surface NKG2D expression and how exposure to the specific ligand major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecule B (MICB) affects receptor traffic and fate. While in the NKL cell line and ""resting"" NK cells NKG2D was found principally at the cell surface, in activated primary NK cells an intracellular pool of receptor could also be found recycling to the plasma membrane. Exposure of NK cells to targets expressing MICB resulted in degradation of approximately 50% of total NKG2D protein and lysosomal degradation of the DAP10 adaptor molecule. Consistent with these observations, confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated that DAP10 trafficked to secretory lysosomes in both transfected NKL cells and in activated primary NK cells upon interaction with MICB-expressing target cells. Interestingly, polarization to the synapse of secretory lysosomes containing DAP10 was also observed. The implications of the intracellular traffic of the NKG2D/DAP10 receptor complex for NK cell activation are discussed. We propose that the rapid degradation of NKG2D/DAP10 observed coincident with recruitment of the receptor to the cytotoxic immune synapse may explain the loss of NKG2D receptor expression after chronic exposure to NKG2D ligands.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2009
12234182,The transmembrane domain of receptor-activity-modifying protein 1 is essential for the functional expression of a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor.,"Three receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMP) define specific interactions between calcitonin (CT) gene-related peptide (CGRP), adrenomedullin (AM) and amylin, and a CT receptor or a CT receptor-like receptor (CRLR). Both form heterodimeric RAMP/receptor complexes at the cell surface. This association represents a novel principle of G protein-coupled receptor function. RAMP1 is transported to the cell surface together with the CRLR or the CT receptor. Here, we have investigated the functional relevance of the short C-terminal intracellular tail QSKRTEGIV and of the single transmembrane domain of human (h) RAMP1 for their interactions with the hCRLR to constitute a CGRP receptor. To this end, hRAMP1 has been sequentially truncated from the C-terminus, and [(125)I]h alpha CGRP/hRAMP1/hCRLR association at the cell surface and cAMP accumulation in response to h alpha CGRP have been examined. With the C-terminal truncation of hRAMP1 by four amino acids wild-type hRAMP1 function was maintained, and the hCRLR was required for the transport of hRAMP1 to the cell surface. Further truncation of hRAMP1 through removal of the remaining five intracellular amino acids revealed CRLR-independent cell surface delivery but otherwise normal hRAMP1 activity. Sequential shortening of the hRAMP1 transmembrane domain resulted in progressively impaired association with the hCRLR and, as a consequence, abolished CGRP receptor function. In conclusion, the intracellular QSKRT sequence adjacent to the transmembrane domain of hRAMP1 provides a signal for intracellular retention. The sequence is unrelated to consensus endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval motives and overridden by the presence of the hCRLR. The entire single transmembrane domain of hRAMP1 together with one hydrophilic amino acid residue at its C-terminus is required for the formation of a fully functional CGRP/hRAMP1/hCRLR receptor complex.",Biochemistry,2002
11738243,The truncated metabolite GLP-2 (3-33) interacts with the GLP-2 receptor as a partial agonist.,"The therapeutic potential of the intestinotrophic mediator glucagon-like peptide-2 (1-33) [GLP-2 (1-33)] has increased interest in the pharmacokinetics of the peptide. This study was undertaken to investigate whether the primary degradation product GLP-2 (3-33) interacts with the GLP-2 receptor. Functional (cAMP) and binding in vitro studies were carried out in cells expressing the transfected human GLP-2 receptor. Furthermore, a biologic response of GLP-2 (3-33) was tested in vivo. Mice were allocated to groups treated for 10 days (twice daily) with: (1) 5 microg GLP-2 (1-33), (2) 25 microg GLP-2 (3-33), (3) 5 microg GLP-2 (1-33)+100 microg GLP-2 (3-33), or (4) 5 microg GLP-2 (1-33)+500 microg GLP-2 (3-33). The intestine was investigated for growth changes. GLP-2 (3-33) bound to the GLP-2 receptor with a binding affinity of 7.5% of that of GLP-2 (1-33). cAMP accumulation was stimulated with an efficacy of 15% and a potency more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of GLP-2 (1-33). Increasing doses of GLP-2 (3-33) (10(-7)-10(-5) M) caused a shift to the right in the dose-response curve of GLP-2 (1-33). Treatment of mice with either GLP-2 (1-33) or (3-33) induced significant growth responses in both the small and large intestines, but the response induced by GLP-2 (3-33) was much smaller. Co-administration of 500 microg of GLP-2 (3-33) and 5 microg GLP-2 (1-33) resulted in a growth response that was smaller than that of 5 microg GLP-2 (1-33) alone. Consistent with the observed in vivo activities, our functional studies and binding data indicate that GLP-2 (3-33) acts as a partial agonist with potential competitive antagonistic properties on the GLP-2 receptor.",Regulatory peptides,2002
15811952,The tumor suppressor TSLC1/NECL-2 triggers NK-cell and CD8+ T-cell responses through the cell-surface receptor CRTAM.,"The tumor suppressor in lung cancer-1 (TSLC1) gene is frequently silenced in human lung carcinomas, and its expression suppresses tumorigenesis in nude mice. TSLC1 encodes a cell-surface protein called Necl-2 that belongs to the Nectin and Nectin-like (Necl) family of molecules. Necl-2 mediates epithelial cell junctions by homotypic contacts and/or heterotypic interactions with other Nectins and Necls. Thus, it inhibits tumorigenesis by ensuring that epithelial cells grow in organized layers. Here, we demonstrate that natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells recognize Necl-2 through a receptor known as class I-restricted T-cell-associated molecule (CRTAM), which is expressed only on activated cells. CRTAM-Necl-2 interactions promote cytotoxicity of NK cells and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion of CD8+ T cells in vitro as well as NK cell-mediated rejection of tumors expressing Necl-2 in vivo. These results provide evidence for an additional mechanism of tumor suppression mediated by TSLC1 that involves cytotoxic lymphocytes. Furthermore, they reveal Necl-2 as one of the molecular targets that allows the immunosurveillance network to distinguish tumor cells from normal cells.",Blood,2005
10631182,The type I BMP receptor BMPRIB is required for chondrogenesis in the mouse limb.,"Mice carrying a targeted disruption of BmprIB were generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. BmprIB(-/-) mice are viable and, in spite of the widespread expression of BMPRIB throughout the developing skeleton, exhibit defects that are largely restricted to the appendicular skeleton. Using molecular markers, we show that the initial formation of the digital rays occurs normally in null mutants, but proliferation of prechondrogenic cells and chondrocyte differentiation in the phalangeal region are markedly reduced. Our results suggest that BMPRIB-mediated signaling is required for cell proliferation after commitment to the chondrogenic lineage. Analyses of BmprIB and Gdf5 single mutants, as well as BmprIB; Gdf5 double mutants suggests that GDF5 is a ligand for BMPRIB in vivo. BmprIB; Bmp7 double mutants were constructed in order to examine whether BMPRIB has overlapping functions with other type I BMP receptors. BmprIB; Bmp7 double mutants exhibit severe appendicular skeletal defects, suggesting that BMPRIB and BMP7 act in distinct, but overlapping pathways. These results also demonstrate that in the absence of BMPRIB, BMP7 plays an essential role in appendicular skeletal development. Therefore, rather than having a unique role, BMPRIB has broadly overlapping functions with other BMP receptors during skeletal development.",,
11956183,"The type XIII collagen ectodomain is a 150-nm rod and capable of binding to fibronectin, nidogen-2, perlecan, and heparin.","Type XIII collagen consists of a short N-terminal intracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a collagenous ectodomain, and it is found at many sites of cell adhesion. We report on the characterization of recombinant type XIII collagen. The shed ectodomain was purified from insect cell culture medium and shown to form 240-kDa trimers with a T(m) of 42 degrees C. Correct chain association into a triple-helical conformation was confirmed by limited pepsin digestion and CD spectroscopy. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy of the ectodomain revealed it to be a 150-nm rod with two flexible hinges separating 31-, 52-, and 68-nm portions. The rods represent the collagenous domains 1-3, and the hinges coincide with the non-collagenous domains 2 and 3. By using surface plasmon resonance analysis, the ectodomain showed interaction with immobilized fibronectin, nidogen-2, and perlecan with K(D) values in the nanomolar range. The binding sites of type XIII collagen for fibronectin were localized to the collagenous domains, whereas the binding activities for nidogen-2 and perlecan resided in the pepsin-sensitive portions of the ectodomain. Furthermore, the ectodomain bound significantly to heparin, which also inhibited shedding of the ectodomain in insect cell cultures. The results reveal that type XIII collagen is notably distinct in its structure compared with other cell-surface proteins, and the in vitro binding with fibronectin, heparin, and two basement membrane components is indicative of multiple cell-matrix interactions in which this ubiquitously expressed protein participates.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2002
30888046,The Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates Nectin2/CD112 expression and impairs NK cell recognition and killing.,"Nectin2 is a member of immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules and plays a prominent role in the establishment of adherens and tight junctions. It is also upregulated on the surface of tumor and virus-infected cells where it functions as a ligand for the activating receptor CD226, thus contributing to cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated recognition and killing of damaged cells. Little is currently known about the regulation of Nectin2 expression and, in particular, whether posttranscriptional and posttranslational mechanisms are involved. Here, we analyzed Nectin2 expression on a panel of human tumor cell lines and primary cultures and we found that Nectin2 is mainly expressed in cytoplasmic pools. Moreover, we demonstrated that ubiquitination of Nectin2 promotes its degradation and is responsible for protein intracellular retention. Indeed, inhibition of the ubiquitin pathway results in increased Nectin2 surface expression and enhances tumor cell susceptibility to NK cell cytotoxicity. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown mechanism of Nectin2 regulation revealing that the ubiquitin pathway represents a potential target of intervention in order to increase susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis.",European journal of immunology,2019
8702757,The unpredicted high affinities of a large number of naturally occurring tachykinins for chimeric NK1/NK3 receptors suggest a role for an inhibitory domain in determining receptor specificity.,"Three chimeric receptors were constructed by exchanging exon sequences between human NK1 and NK3 receptor genes. The resulting chimeric receptors not only retained high affinities for their natural ligands substance P and neurokinin B but also exhibited surprisingly high affinities for other naturally occurring tachykinins including neurokinin A, neuropeptide K, neuropeptide gamma, eledoisin, kassinin, physalaemin, and phyllomedusin. In contrast, these chimeric receptors displayed a wide range of variability in their affinities for non-naturally occurring ligands including selective agonists and antagonists of NK1, NK2, and NK3 receptors. Since the only common feature among these naturally occurring neurokinin peptides is the conserved C-terminal sequences, our data suggest that these conserved sequences must play the major role in conferring high affinity binding to the chimeric receptors. To explain the apparently ""improved"" affinities of these naturally occurring ligands for the chimeric receptors as compared with their affinities for the parent NK1 and NK3 receptors, we are proposing that certain inhibitory domains that are present in the NK1 and/or NK3 receptors are compromised in these chimeric receptors. Upon disruption of these inhibitory domains during the formation of chimeras, the naturally occurring ligands can interact more favorably with chimeric receptors through their conserved C-terminal sequences. Based on this hypothesis, the binding affinities of natural tachykinin ligands may be largely determined by their conserved C-terminal sequences, whereas receptor selectivities of these ligands are influenced more by the presence or absence of inhibitory domains rather than specific binding domains on their target receptors.",,
12665544,The use of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 2 to study neuropeptide Y receptor agonist-induced beta-arrestin 2 interaction.,"The neuropeptide Y (NPY) family peptides NPY, peptide YY (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) bind to four G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5. A key step in the desensitization and internalization of GPCRs is the association of the receptor with beta-arrestins. In the present study, these receptors were analyzed with respect to their ability to interact with GFP2-tagged beta-arrestin 2 using the new bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 2 method. Agonists induced a concentration-dependent association of beta-arrestin 2 with all four receptors. Whereas the Y1 receptor exhibited the highest maximum response and rapid association (t(1/2) = 3.4 min), the maximal signals for the association of Y2 and Y4 receptors were less than half of that of Y1, and the association rates were much slower. Interestingly, when evaluated at the Y4 receptor, the Y4 agonist 1229U91 [(Ile,Glu,Pro,Dpr,Tyr,Arg, Leu,Arg,Try-NH2)-2-cyclic(2,4'),(2',4)-diamide] was unable to provoke the same maximal response as human PP, suggesting that 1229U91 is a partial agonist. When stimulated by PYY, the Y5 receptor responded with a t(1/2) of 4.6 min and a maximal response approximately 60% of what was observed with Y1. Because beta-arrestins are key components in GPCR internalization, it is interesting to note that the receptor that is known to internalize rapidly (Y1) exhibits the most rapid association with beta-arrestin 2, whereas the receptor that is known to internalize slowly, or not at all (Y2) associates slowly with beta-arrestin 2.",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2003
16530705,The VEGF-C/Flt-4 axis promotes invasion and metastasis of cancer cells.,"Flt-4, a VEGF receptor, is activated by its specific ligand, VEGF-C. The resultant signaling pathway promotes angiogenesis and/or lymphangiogenesis. This report provides evidence that the VEGF-C/Flt-4 axis enhances cancer cell mobility and invasiveness and contributes to the promotion of cancer cell metastasis. VEGF-C/Flt-4-mediated invasion and metastasis of cancer cells were found to require upregulation of the neural cell adhesion molecule contactin-1 through activation of the Src-p38 MAPK-C/EBP-dependent pathway. Examination of tumor tissues from various types of cancers revealed high levels of Flt-4 and VEGF-C expression that correlated closely with clinical metastasis and patient survival. The VEGF-C/Flt-4 axis, through upregulation of contactin-1, may regulate the invasive capacity in different types of cancer cells.",Cancer cell,2006
12870663,The very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor--a peripheral lipoprotein receptor for remnant lipoproteins into fatty acid active tissues.,"The VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) receptor is a member of the LDL (low density lipoprotein) receptor family. The VLDL receptor binds apolipoprotein (apo) E but not apo B, and is expressed in fatty acid active tissues (heart, muscle, adipose) and macrophages abundantly. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) modulates the binding of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein particles to the VLDL receptor. By the unique ligand specificity, VLDL receptor practically appeared to function as IDL (intermediate density lipoprotein) and chylomicron remnant receptor in peripheral tissues in concert with LPL. In contrast to LDL receptor, the VLDL receptor expression is not down regulated by lipoproteins. Recently several possible functions of the VLDL receptor have been reported in lipoprotein metabolism, atherosclerosis, obesity/insulin resistance, cardiac fatty acid metabolism and neuronal migration. The gene therapy of VLDL receptor into the LDL receptor knockout mice liver showed a benefit effect for lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis. Further researches about the VLDL receptor function will be needed in the future.",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,2003
7592875,The very low density lipoprotein receptor mediates the cellular catabolism of lipoprotein lipase and urokinase-plasminogen activator inhibitor type I complexes.,"The very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor binds apolipoprotein E-rich lipoproteins as well as the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP). Ligand blotting experiments using RAP and immunoblotting experiments using an anti-VLDL receptor IgG detected the VLDL receptor in detergent extracts of human aortic endothelial cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and human aortic smooth muscle cells. To gain insight into the role of the VLDL receptor in the vascular endothelium, its ligand binding properties were further characterized. In vitro binding experiments documented that lipoprotein lipase (LpL), a key enzyme in lipoprotein catabolism, binds with high affinity to purified VLDL receptor. In addition, urokinase complexed with plasminogen activator-inhibitor type I (uPA.PAI-1) also bound to the purified VLDL receptor with high affinity. To assess the capacity of the VLDL receptor to mediate the cellular internalization of ligands, an adenoviral vector was used to introduce the VLDL receptor gene into a murine embryonic fibroblast cell line deficient in the VLDL receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein, another endocytic receptor known to bind LpL and uPA.PAI-1 complexes. Infected fibroblasts that express the VLDL receptor mediate the cellular internalization of 125I-labeled LpL and uPA.PAI-1 complexes, leading to their degradation. Non-infected fibroblasts or fibroblasts infected with the lacZ gene did not internalize these ligands. These studies confirm that the VLDL receptor binds to and mediates the catabolism of LpL and uPA.PAI-1 complexes. Thus, the VLDL receptor may play a unique role on the vascular endothelium in lipoprotein catabolism by regulating levels of LpL and in the regulation of fibrinolysis by facilitating the removal of urokinase complexed with its inhibitor.",,
7984244,The X-ray structure of a growth hormone-prolactin receptor complex.,"The human pituitary hormones, growth hormone (hGH) and prolactin (hPRL), regulate a large variety of physiological processes, among which are growth and differentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage cells, and lactation. These activities are initiated by hormone-receptor binding. The hGH and hPRL receptors (hGHR and hPRLR, respectively) are single-pass transmembrane receptors from class 1 of the haematopoietic receptor superfamily. This classification is based on sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, notably a highly conserved pentapeptide, the so-called 'WSXWS box', the function of which is controversial. All ligands in class 1 activate their respective receptors by clustering mechanisms. In the case of hGH, activation involves receptor homodimerization in a sequential process: the active ternary complex containing one ligand and two receptor molecules is formed by association of a receptor molecule to an intermediate 1:1 complex. hPRL does not bind to the hGH receptor, but hGH binds to both the hGHR and hPRLR, and mutagenesis studies have shown that the receptor-binding sites on hGH overlap. We present here the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex of hGH bound to the extracellular domain of the hPRLR. Comparisons with the hGH-hGHR complex reveal how hGH can bind to the two distinctly different receptor binding surfaces.",Nature,1994
10747918,"The YXXL motif, but not the two NPXY motifs, serves as the dominant endocytosis signal for low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein.","All members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family contain at least one copy of the NPXY sequence within their cytoplasmic tails. For the LDL receptor, it has been demonstrated that the NPXY motif serves as a signal for rapid endocytosis through coated pits. Thus, it is generally believed that the NPXY sequences function as endocytosis signals for all the LDL receptor family members. The primary aim of this study is to define the endocytosis signal(s) within the cytoplasmic tail of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP). By using LRP minireceptors, which mimic the function and trafficking of full-length endogenous LRP, we demonstrate that the YXXL motif, but not the two NPXY motifs, serves as the dominant signal for LRP endocytosis. We also found that the distal di-leucine motif within the LRP tail contributes to its endocytosis, and its function is independent of the YXXL motif. Although the proximal NPXY motif and the proximal di-leucine motif each play a limited role in LRP endocytosis in the context of the full-length tail, these motifs were functional within the truncated receptor tail. In addition, we show that LRP minireceptor mutants defective in endocytosis signal(s) accumulate at the cell surface and are less efficient in delivery of ligand for degradation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
21368222,Therapeutic targeting of SPINK1-positive prostate cancer.,"Gene fusions involving ETS (erythroblastosis virus E26 transformation-specific) family transcription factors are found in ~50% of prostate cancers and as such can be used as a basis for the molecular subclassification of prostate cancer. Previously, we showed that marked overexpression of SPINK1 (serine peptidase inhibitor, Kazal type 1), which encodes a secreted serine protease inhibitor, defines an aggressive molecular subtype of ETS fusion-negative prostate cancers (SPINK1+/ETS⁻, ~10% of all prostate cancers). Here, we examined the potential of SPINK1 as an extracellular therapeutic target in prostate cancer. Recombinant SPINK1 protein (rSPINK1) stimulated cell proliferation in benign RWPE as well as cancerous prostate cells. Indeed, RWPE cells treated with either rSPINK1 or conditioned medium from 22RV1 prostate cancer cells (SPINK1+/ETS⁻) significantly increased cell invasion and intravasation when compared with untreated cells. In contrast, knockdown of SPINK1 in 22RV1 cells inhibited cell proliferation, cell invasion, and tumor growth in xenograft assays. 22RV1 cell proliferation, invasion, and intravasation were attenuated by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to SPINK1 as well. We also demonstrated that SPINK1 partially mediated its neoplastic effects through interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Administration of antibodies to SPINK1 or EGFR (cetuximab) in mice bearing 22RV1 xenografts attenuated tumor growth by more than 60 and 40%, respectively, or ~75% when combined, without affecting PC3 xenograft (SPINK1⁻/ETS⁻) growth. Thus, this study suggests that SPINK1 may be a therapeutic target in a subset of patients with SPINK1+/ETS⁻ prostate cancer. Our results provide a rationale for both the development of humanized mAbs to SPINK1 and evaluation of EGFR inhibition in SPINK1+/ETS⁻ prostate cancers.",Science translational medicine,2011
7957082,"Three residues in the common beta chain of the human GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 receptors are essential for GM-CSF and IL-5 but not IL-3 high affinity binding and interact with Glu21 of GM-CSF.","The beta subunit (beta c) of the receptors for human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) is essential for high affinity ligand-binding and signal transduction. An important feature of this subunit is its common nature, being able to interact with GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5. Analogous common subunits have also been identified in other receptor systems including gp130 and the IL-2 receptor gamma subunit. It is not clear how common receptor subunits bind multiple ligands. We have used site-directed mutagenesis and binding assays with radiolabelled GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 to identify residues in the beta c subunit involved in affinity conversion for each ligand. Alanine substitutions in the region Tyr365-Ile368 in beta c showed that Tyr365, His367 and Ile368 were required for GM-CSF and IL-5 high affinity binding, whereas Glu366 was unimportant. In contrast, alanine substitutions of these residues only marginally reduced the conversion of IL-3 binding to high affinity by beta c. To identify likely contact points in GM-CSF involved in binding to the 365-368 beta c region we used the GM-CSF mutant eco E21R which is unable to interact with wild-type beta c whilst retaining full GM-CSF receptor alpha chain binding. Eco E21R exhibited greater binding affinity to receptor alpha beta complexes composed of mutant beta chains Y365A, H367A and I368A than to those composed of wild-type beta c or mutant E366A. These results (i) identify the residues Tyr365, His367 and Ile368 as critical for affinity conversion by beta c, (ii) show that high affinity binding of GM-CSF and IL-5 can be dissociated from IL-3 and (iii) suggest that Tyr365, His367 and Ile368 in beta c interact with Glu21 of GM-CSF.",,
12682249,Threonine phosphorylation sites in the beta 2 and beta 7 leukocyte integrin polypeptides.,"The cytoplasmic domains of integrins play a key role in a variety of integrin-mediated events including adhesion, migration, and signaling. The molecular mechanisms that enhance integrin function are still incompletely understood. Because protein kinases are known to be involved in the signaling and the activation of integrins, the role of phosphorylation has been studied by several groups. The beta(2) leukocyte integrin subunit has previously been shown to become phosphorylated in leukocytes on cytoplasmic serine and functionally important threonine residues. We have now mapped the phosphorylated threonine residues in activated T cells. After phorbol ester stimulation, all three threonine residues (758-760) of the threonine triplet became phosphorylated but only two at a time. CD3 stimulation leads to a strong threonine phosphorylation of the beta(2) integrin, but differed from phorbol ester activation in that phosphorylation occurred only on threonine 758. The other leukocyte-specific integrin, beta(7), has also been shown to need the cytoplasmic domain and leukocyte-specific signal transduction elements for integrin activation. Cell activation with phorbol ester, and interestingly, through the TCR-CD3 complex, caused beta(7) integrin binding to VCAM-1. Additionally, cell activation led to increased phosphorylation of the beta(7) subunit, and phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that threonine residues became phosphorylated after cell activation. Sequence analysis by manual radiosequencing by Edman degradation established that threonine phosphorylation occurred in the same threonine triplet as in beta(2) phosphorylation.",,
2207326,Thrombin induces a rapid redistribution of glycoprotein Ib-IX complexes within the membrane systems of activated human platelets.,"Previous studies have shown a decreased binding of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complexes on thrombin-stimulated platelets, but the reason for this is poorly understood. We have used (1) immunofluorescence procedures and flow cytometry, and (2) immunogold staining and electron microscopy to investigate this phenomenon. Washed platelets were incubated with alpha-thrombin, adenosine diphosphate, or ionophore A23187 for increasing lengths of time. For alpha-thrombin, but not the other agonists, flow cytometry confirmed a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the binding of MoAbs specific for GP Ib alpha (AP-1, Bx-1), GP IX (FMC 25), or to the complex itself (SZ 1). Immunoglold staining performed using standard transmission or scanning electron microscopy high-lighted surface areas devoid of bound antibody. However, a quantitatively normal immunofluorescence was restored if paraformaldehyde-fixed, thrombin-stimulated platelets were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO) before MoAb addition, while immunogold staining was now seen to be concentrated within the interior of the platelet. Glutaraldehyde-fixed samples were then embedded in the resin Lowicryl K4M (Taab Laboratories Equipment Ltd, Aldermaston, England) and immunogold staining performed on thin sections using a polyclonal antibody to glycocalicin. An increased presence of GP Ib-IX complexes within surface-connected membrane systems of the thrombin-stimulated platelets was confirmed. Interestingly, GP Ib-IX movement was opposite to the thrombin-induced externalization of internal pools of GP IIb-IIIa complexes and of the alpha-granule membrane GP, GMP-140.",Blood,1990
19417209,Thrombin-cleaved osteopontin regulates hemopoietic stem and progenitor cell functions through interactions with alpha9beta1 and alpha4beta1 integrins.,"Osteopontin (OPN), a multifunctional acidic glycoprotein, expressed by osteoblasts within the endosteal region of the bone marrow (BM) suppresses the proliferation of hemopoietic stem and progenitor cells and also regulates their lodgment within the BM after transplantation. Herein we demonstrate that OPN cleavage fragments are the most abundant forms of this protein within the BM. Studies aimed to determine how hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) interact with OPN revealed for the first time that murine and human HSCs express alpha(9)beta(1) integrin. The N-terminal thrombin cleavage fragment of OPN through its binding to the alpha(9)beta(1) and alpha(4)beta(1) integrins plays a key role in the attraction, retention, regulation, and release of hemopoietic stem and progenitor cells to, in, and from their BM niche. Thrombin-cleaved OPN (trOPN) acts as a chemoattractant for stem and progenitor cells, mediating their migration in a manner that involves interaction with alpha(9)beta(1) and alpha(4)beta(1) integrins. In addition, in the absence of OPN, there is an increased number of white blood cells and, specifically, stem and progenitor cells in the peripheral circulation.",,
7615164,Thrombomodulin as a model of molecular mechanisms that modulate protease specificity and function at the vessel surface.,"The protein C anticoagulant system generates an ""on demand"" physiologic anticoagulant response. The pathway is initiated when thrombin binds to the endothelial cell thrombin binding protein, thrombomodulin. The complex exhibits dramatically altered macromolecular specificity. It rapidly cleaves the protein C zymogen to form the anticoagulant, activated protein C. Complex formation between thrombin and thrombomodulin also prevents thrombin, the enzyme responsible for clot formation and a potent platelet activator, from being able to clot fibrinogen or to activate platelets. Structural, kinetic, and competition studies suggest that thrombomodulin blocks these clotting reactions by masking the binding sites for fibrinogen and the platelet thrombin receptor. Stimulation of protein C activation appears to occur through conformational changes in the extended binding pocket of thrombin. This prevents repulsive interactions with protein C that exist when the free enzyme attempts to dock with this substrate. In addition to protein-protein interactions, thrombomodulin has a covalently associated chondroitin sulfate moiety. Chondroitin sulfate binds to a basic surface on thrombin that is also involved in heparin interaction. The chondroitin sulfate enhances the affinity of thrombin for thrombomodulin approximately 10- to 20-fold, making thrombomodulin a more potent inhibitor of coagulation, altering thrombin's conformation and specificity, and accelerating thrombin inhibition by the serpin, antithrombin. These properties make thrombomodulin a molecular switch ideally suited to trigger an anticoagulant response when too much thrombin is generated. The importance of the system is documented by the clinical observation that patients deficient in protein C often die of massive thrombotic complications that can be reversed or prevented by infusion of protein C.",,
10495959,Thrombopoietin.,"Thrombopoietin (TPO) was first described as an activity in thrombocytopenic serum that could stimulate platelet production upon transfer into other animals. The molecular cloning of TPO has allowed a detailed characterisation of its precise biological activities, both in vitro and in vivo. TPO binds its specific receptor, the c-Mpl protein, which is expressed on the surface of target cells, and induces receptor dimerization and activation of intracellular signalling pathways including the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and Ras cascades. TPO is a lineage-dominant cytokine, stimulating megakaryocyte production and maturation in vitro and inducing the greatest elevation in platelet numbers of any known cytokine upon administration to humans or laboratory animals. Indeed, gene targeting studies have established that the TPO/c-Mpl signalling system is the major physiological regulator of steady-state megakaryocyte and platelet production. These studies have also revealed a largely unanticipated role for TPO in the regulation of hemopoietic stem cells. Preclinical studies in animal models have indicated the capacity of c-Mpl ligands to overcome the thrombocytopenia associated with chemo/radiotherapy and clinical trials have already demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Mpl-ligands in elevating platelet counts in humans. It is likely that these molecules will lead to new therapeutics that will find utility in a range of clinical contexts.",,
19147503,Thrombospondin 2 potentiates notch3/jagged1 signaling.,"Extracellular thrombospondins (TSP or THBS) and the Notch family of transmembrane receptors share a role in multiple, overlapping cellular functions and participate in developmental signaling and pathological reactions to tissue injury. We demonstrate that TSP2, but not TSP1, enhances the potency of Notch3 signal transduction. In addition, TSP2 reduces cancer cell proliferation in a Notch-ligand dependent fashion. The loss of TSP2 in knock-out mice reduces Notch target gene expression. TSP2 binds directly to Notch3 and Jagged1. TSP1 also binds to Notch3 and Jagged1; however, only TSP2 augments the interaction between Notch3 and Jagged1. These studies demonstrate that the diverse functions of TSP2 may also include a role as an intermediary protein that facilitates transcellular receptor-ligand interactions.",,
22308318,Thrombospondin-1 acts as a ligand for CD148 tyrosine phosphatase.,"CD148 is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase that is expressed in several cell types, including vascular endothelial cells and duct epithelial cells. Growing evidence demonstrates a prominent role for CD148 in negative regulation of growth factor signals, suppressing cell proliferation and transformation. However, its extracellular ligand(s) remain unknown. To identify the ligand(s) of CD148, we introduced HA-tagged CD148 into cultured endothelial cells and then isolated its interacting extracellular protein(s) by biotin surface labeling and subsequent affinity purifications. The binding proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Here we report that soluble thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) binds to the extracellular part of CD148 with high affinity and specificity, and its binding increases CD148 catalytic activity, leading to dephosphorylation of the substrate proteins. Consistent with these findings, introduction of CD148 conferred TSP1-mediated inhibition of cell growth to cells which lack CD148 and TSP1 inhibition of growth. Further, we demonstrate that TSP1-mediated inhibition of endothelial cell growth is antagonized by soluble CD148 ectodomain as well as by CD148 gene silencing. These findings provide evidence that CD148 functions as a receptor for TSP1 and mediates its inhibition of cell growth.",,
10397731,Thrombospondin-1 acts via IAP/CD47 to synergize with collagen in alpha2beta1-mediated platelet activation.,"Integrin-associated protein (IAP; or CD47) is a receptor for the cell binding domain (CBD) of thrombospondin-1 (TS1). In platelets, IAP associates with and regulates the function of alphaIIbbeta3 integrin (Chung et al, J Biol Chem 272:14740, 1997). We test here the possibility that CD47 may also modulate the function of platelet integrin alpha2beta1, a collagen receptor. The CD47 agonist peptide, 4N1K (KRFYVVMWKK), derived from the CBD, synergizes with soluble collagen in aggregating platelet-rich plasma. 4N1K and intact TS1 also induce the aggregation of washed, unstirred platelets on immobilized collagen with a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. The effects of TS1 and 4N1K on platelet aggregation are absolutely dependent on IAP, as shown by the use of platelets from IAP-/- mice. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) prevents 4N1K-dependent aggregation on immobilized collagen but does not inhibit the 4N1K peptide stimulation of alpha2beta1-dependent platelet spreading. Finally, a detergent-stable, physical association of IAP and alpha2beta1 integrin is detected by coimmunoprecipitation. These results imply a role for IAP and TS1 in the early activation of platelets upon adhesion to collagen.",Blood,1999
9169439,Thrombspondin acts via integrin-associated protein to activate the platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3.,"Integrin-associated protein (IAP or CD47) is a receptor for the cell/platelet-binding domain (CBD) of thrombospondin-1 (TS1), the most abundant protein of platelet alpha granules. Although it associates with alphaIIbbeta3, IAP has no known function in platelets. TS1, the CBD, and an IAP agonist peptide (4N1K) from the CBD of TS1 activate the platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3, resulting in platelet spreading on immobilized fibrinogen, stimulation of platelet aggregation, and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. Furthermore, 4N1K peptide selectively stimulates the phosphorylation of LYN and SYK and their association with FAK. The phosphorylation of SYK is blocked by pertussis toxin, implicating a Gi-like heterotrimeric G protein. IAP solublized from membranes of unstimulated platelets binds specifically to an affinity column of 4N1K peptide. Both alphaIIb and beta3 integrin subunits and c-Src bind along with IAP. This complex of proteins is also detected with immunoprecipitation. Activation of platelets with the agonist peptide 4N1K results in the association of FAK with the IAP-alphaIIbbeta3 complex. Thus an important function of TS1 in platelets is that of a secreted costimulator of alphaIIbbeta3 whose unique properties result in its localization to the platelet surface and the fibrin clot.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1997
8886855,Thymosin alpha 1 interacts with the VIP receptor-effector system in rat and mouse immunocompetent cells.,"Thymic peptide thymosin alpha 1 (10(-11) to 10(-6) M) is shown to interact with the VIP receptor-effector system in rat and mouse peritoneal macrophages, and both rat peripheral blood lymphocytes and spleen lymphocytes. In all models, thymosin alpha 1 inhibits 125I-VIP binding with a potency that is in a range 1000-1700 times lower than that of the native VIP. Interaction of thymosin alpha 1 with VIP receptors is compared with that of some structurally VIP-related peptides such as helodermin, PHI, secretin, and glucagon. The order of potency in inhibiting 125I-VIP binding was VIP > helodermin > PHI > secretin > thymosin alpha 1. Thymosin alpha 1 (10(-10) to 10(-6) M) was weak in stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity. Its efficacy is in a range 900-1800 times lower than that of native VIP in all cell types studied. The analysis of the sequence of both complete and N-terminal portion of thymosin alpha 1 reveals close structural and physicochemical similarities with the members of the so-called VIP family of polypeptides. Taken together, experimental data support that thymosin alpha 1 must be included like the lowest partial agonist of the VIP family of polypeptides and it is a VIP receptor antagonist with weak intrinsic activity.",,
12045258,"Thyrostimulin, a heterodimer of two new human glycoprotein hormone subunits, activates the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor.","Human thyrotropin (TSH), luteotropin (LH), follitropin (FSH), and chorionic gonadotropin are members of the heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone family. The common alpha subunit forms noncovalent heterodimers with different beta subunits. Two novel human glycoprotein hormonelike genes, alpha2 (A2) and beta5 (B5), recently have been identified. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, the two subunits were found as potential heterodimerization partners. Immunological analyses confirmed the heterodimerization of A2 and B5 in transfected cells and their colocalization in the anterior pituitary. Recombinant A2/B5 heterodimeric glycoproteins, purified using cation exchange and size fractionation chromatography, activated human TSH receptors, but not LH and FSH receptors, and showed high affinity to TSH receptors in a radioligand receptor assay. The heterodimer also stimulated cAMP production and thymidine incorporation by cultured thyroid cells and increased serum thyroxine levels in TSH-suppressed rats in vivo. This new heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone was named as thyrostimulin based on its thyroid-stimulating activity. The expression of thyrostimulin in the anterior pituitary known to express TSH receptors suggested a paracrine mechanism. The present discovery of a new ligand based on genomic approaches could facilitate the understanding of the physiological roles of extra-thyroid TSH receptor systems and the structural-functional basis of receptor signaling by related glycoprotein hormones.",The Journal of clinical investigation,2002
27548530,Tie1 controls angiopoietin function in vascular remodeling and inflammation.,"The angiopoietin/Tie (ANG/Tie) receptor system controls developmental and tumor angiogenesis, inflammatory vascular remodeling, and vessel leakage. ANG1 is a Tie2 agonist that promotes vascular stabilization in inflammation and sepsis, whereas ANG2 is a context-dependent Tie2 agonist or antagonist. A limited understanding of ANG signaling mechanisms and the orphan receptor Tie1 has hindered development of ANG/Tie-targeted therapeutics. Here, we determined that both ANG1 and ANG2 binding to Tie2 increases Tie1-Tie2 interactions in a β1 integrin-dependent manner and that Tie1 regulates ANG-induced Tie2 trafficking in endothelial cells. Endothelial Tie1 was essential for the agonist activity of ANG1 and autocrine ANG2. Deletion of endothelial Tie1 in mice reduced Tie2 phosphorylation and downstream Akt activation, increased FOXO1 nuclear localization and transcriptional activation, and prevented ANG1- and ANG2-induced capillary-to-venous remodeling. However, in acute endotoxemia, the Tie1 ectodomain that is responsible for interaction with Tie2 was rapidly cleaved, ANG1 agonist activity was decreased, and autocrine ANG2 agonist activity was lost, which led to suppression of Tie2 signaling. Tie1 cleavage also occurred in patients with hantavirus infection. These results support a model in which Tie1 directly interacts with Tie2 to promote ANG-induced vascular responses under noninflammatory conditions, whereas in inflammation, Tie1 cleavage contributes to loss of ANG2 agonist activity and vascular stability.",,
20566714,TIM1 is an endogenous ligand for LMIR5/CD300b: LMIR5 deficiency ameliorates mouse kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"Leukocyte mono-immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor 5 (LMIR5)/CD300b is a DAP12-coupled activating receptor predominantly expressed in myeloid cells. The ligands for LMIR have not been reported. We have identified T cell Ig mucin 1 (TIM1) as a possible ligand for LMIR5 by retrovirus-mediated expression cloning. TIM1 interacted only with LMIR5 among the LMIR family, whereas LMIR5 interacted with TIM4 as well as TIM1. The Ig-like domain of LMIR5 bound to TIM1 in the vicinity of the phosphatidylserine (PS)-binding site within the Ig-like domain of TIM1. Unlike its binding to TIM1 or TIM4, LMIR5 failed to bind to PS. LMIR5 binding did not affect TIM1- or TIM4-mediated phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, and stimulation with TIM1 or TIM4 induced LMIR5-mediated activation of mast cells. Notably, LMIR5 deficiency suppressed TIM1-Fc-induced recruitment of neutrophils in the dorsal air pouch, and LMIR5 deficiency attenuated neutrophil accumulation in a model of ischemia/reperfusion injury in the kidneys in which TIM1 expression is up-regulated. In that model, LMIR5 deficiency resulted in ameliorated tubular necrosis and cast formation in the acute phase. Collectively, our results indicate that TIM1 is an endogenous ligand for LMIR5 and that the TIM1-LMIR5 interaction plays a physiological role in immune regulation by myeloid cells.",,
28949386,TIM4-TIM1 interaction modulates Th2 pattern inflammation through enhancing SIRT1 expression.,"Skewed T helper 2 (Th2)‑cell polarization plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammations; however, the underlying mechanisms require further elucidation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms through which the interaction between T‑cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM)4 and TIM1 regulates the expression of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) in Th2 cells, and the role of SIRT1 in Th2‑cell polarization during nasal allergic inflammation. The results demonstrated that TIM4 expression by splenic dendritic cells was increased in mice with allergic rhinitis, and the TIM4̸TIM1 interaction promoted CD4+ T cells to express SIRT1 during allergic inflammation via enhancing phosphoinositide 3‑kinase/Akt phosphorylation. SIRT1 then facilitated CD4+ T‑cell proliferation through downregulating the expression of Fas ligand, caspase-3 and p53 in mice with nasal allergic inflammation. In conclusion, the interaction of TIM4̸TIM1 was found to promote Th2‑cell proliferation through enhancing SIRT1 expression in mice with nasal allergic rhinitis.",,
12887919,TIMP-2 mediated inhibition of angiogenesis: an MMP-independent mechanism.,"Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) suppress matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity critical for extracellular matrix turnover associated with both physiologic and pathologic tissue remodeling. We demonstrate here that TIMP-2 abrogates angiogenic factor-induced endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo independent of MMP inhibition. These effects require alpha 3 beta 1 integrin-mediated binding of TIMP-2 to endothelial cells. Further, TIMP-2 induces a decrease in total protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity associated with beta1 integrin subunits as well as dissociation of the phosphatase SHP-1 from beta1. TIMP-2 treatment also results in a concomitant increase in PTP activity associated with tyrosine kinase receptors FGFR-1 and KDR. Our findings establish an unexpected, MMP-independent mechanism for TIMP-2 inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and reveal an important component of the antiangiogenic effect of TIMP2 in vivo.",,
11278667,Tissue factor pathway inhibitor inhibits endothelial cell proliferation via association with the very low density lipoprotein receptor.,"Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) contains three Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor domains and is a potent inhibitor of tissue factor-mediated coagulation. Here, we report that TFPI inhibits the proliferation of basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated endothelial cells. A truncated form of TFPI, containing only the first two Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor domains, has very little antiproliferative activity, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal region of TFPI is responsible for this activity. Binding studies revealed that full-length TFPI, but not the truncated TFPI molecule, is recognized by the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL receptor) indicating that this receptor is a novel high affinity endothelial cell receptor for TFPI. The antiproliferative activity of TFPI on endothelial cells is inhibited by the receptor-associated protein, a known antagonist of ligand binding by the VLDL receptor, and by anti-VLDL receptor antibodies. These results confirm that the antiproliferative activity of TFPI is mediated by the VLDL receptor and suggest that this receptor-ligand system may be a useful target for the development of new anti-angiogenic and antitumor agents.",,
9490681,Tissue factor regulates plasminogen binding and activation.,"Tissue factor (TF) has been implicated in several important biologic processes, including fibrin formation, atherogenesis, angiogenesis, and tumor cell migration. In that plasminogen activators have been implicated in the same processes, the potential for interactions between TF and the plasminogen activator system was examined. Plasminogen was found to bind directly to the extracellular domain of TF apoprotein (amino acids 1-219) as determined by optical biosensor interaction analysis. A fragment of plasminogen containing kringles 1 through 3 also bound to TF apoprotein, whereas isolated kringle 4 and miniplasminogen did not. Expression of TF on the surface of a stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stimulated plasminogen binding to the cells by 70% more than to control cells. Plasminogen bound to a site on the TF apoprotein that appears to be distinct from the binding site for factors VII and VIIa as judged by a combination of biosensor and cell assays. TF enhanced two-chain urokinase (tcuPA) activation of Glu-plasminogen, but not of miniplasminogen, in a dose-dependent, saturable manner (half maximal stimulation at 59 pmol/L). TF apoprotein induced an effect similar to that of relipidated TF, but a relatively higher concentration of the apoprotein was required (half maximal stimulation at 3.8 nmol/L). The stimulatory effect of TF on plasminogen activation was confirmed when plasmin formation was examined directly on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In accord with this, TF inhibited fibrinolysis by approximately 74% at a concentration of 14 nmol/L and almost totally inhibited the binding of equimolar concentrations of plasminogen to human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human trophoblasts. Further, CHO cells expressing TF inhibited uPA-mediated fibrinolysis relative to a wild-type control. TF apoprotein and plasminogen were found to colocalize in atherosclerotic plaque. These data suggest that plasminogen localization and activation may be modulated at extravascular sites through a high-affinity interaction between kringles 1 through 3 of plasminogen and the extracellular domain of TF.",,

10684262,Tissue transglutaminase is an integrin-binding adhesion coreceptor for fibronectin.,"The protein cross-linking enzyme tissue transglutaminase binds in vitro with high affinity to fibronectin via its 42-kD gelatin-binding domain. Here we report that cell surface transglutaminase mediates adhesion and spreading of cells on the 42-kD fibronectin fragment, which lacks integrin-binding motifs. Overexpression of tissue transglutaminase increases its amount on the cell surface, enhances adhesion and spreading on fibronectin and its 42-kD fragment, enlarges focal adhesions, and amplifies adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. These effects are specific for tissue transglutaminase and are not shared by its functional homologue, a catalytic subunit of factor XIII. Adhesive function of tissue transglutaminase does not require its cross-linking activity but depends on its stable noncovalent association with integrins. Transglutaminase interacts directly with multiple integrins of beta1 and beta3 subfamilies, but not with beta2 integrins. Complexes of transglutaminase with integrins are formed inside the cell during biosynthesis and accumulate on the surface and in focal adhesions. Together our results demonstrate that tissue transglutaminase mediates the interaction of integrins with fibronectin, thereby acting as an integrin-associated coreceptor to promote cell adhesion and spreading.",The Journal of cell biology,2000
10816592,"Tissue transglutaminase, coagulation factor XIII, and the pro-polypeptide of von Willebrand factor are all ligands for the integrins alpha 9beta 1 and alpha 4beta 1.","We previously reported that MOLT-3 human lymphocyte-like leukemia cells adhere to tissue-type transglutaminase (tTG) through the integrin alpha(4)beta(1). We now report that G-361 human melanoma cells also adhere to tTG, although they do not express alpha(4)beta(1). G-361 cells utilize two additional integrins, alpha(9)beta(1) and alpha(5)beta(1) to adhere to tTG. Furthermore, blood coagulation factor XIII (FXIII), another member of the transglutaminase family that is highly homologous to tTG, and propolypeptide of von Willebrand factor (pp-vWF) also promoted cell adhesion through alpha(9)beta(1) or alpha(4)beta(1) in G-361 or MOLT-3 cells, respectively. In the case of pp-vWF, alpha(9)beta(1) and alpha(4)beta(1) both bind to the same site, comprised of 15 amino acid residues and designated T2-15. Moreover, SW480 human colon cancer cells stably transfected to express alpha(9)beta(1), but not mock transfectants, adhered to tTG, FXIII, pp-vWF, and T2-15/bovine serum albumin conjugate. These data identify tTG, FXIII, and pp-vWF as shared ligands for the integrins alpha(9)beta(1) and alpha(4)beta(1). This report is the first to unambiguously show that these two integrins share the same cell adhesion site within one protein and provides strong support for classifying alpha(9)beta(1-) and alpha(4)-integrins as functionally related members of an integrin subfamily.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
11911831,TL1A is a TNF-like ligand for DR3 and TR6/DcR3 and functions as a T cell costimulator.,"DR3 is a death domain-containing receptor that is upregulated during T cell activation and whose overexpression induces apoptosis and NF-kappaB activation in cell lines. Here we show that an endothelial cell-derived TNF-like factor, TL1A, is a ligand for DR3 and decoy receptor TR6/DcR3 and that its expression is inducible by TNF and IL-1alpha. TL1A induces NF-kappaB activation and apoptosis in DR3-expressing cell lines, while TR6-Fc protein antagonizes these signaling events. Interestingly, in T cells, TL1A acts as a costimulator that increases IL-2 responsiveness and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that interaction of TL1A with DR3 promotes T cell expansion during an immune response, whereas TR6 has an opposing effect.",Immunity,2002
11801679,TNF-alpha potentiates C5a-stimulated eosinophil adhesion to human bronchial epithelial cells: a role for alpha 5 beta 1 integrin.,"Cooperative action of inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules orchestrates eosinophil recruitment during allergic inflammation in the airways. This study investigated the mechanisms involved in increasing eosinophil adhesion to human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) following priming and activation of eosinophils with TNF-alpha and complement protein C5a, respectively. Under primed conditions, eosinophil adhesion increased 3-fold from basal (16%), and the effect was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the increase following stimulation with C5a alone (2-fold). Eosinophil contact with HBEC was essential for priming. In contrast to C5a, adhesion of eotaxin-stimulated eosinophils to HBEC was not primed with TNF-alpha nor IL-5, a known eosinophil-priming agent. Priming caused activation of alpha(M)beta(2) integrin; mAb against either the common beta(2) integrin subunit or its ICAM-1 ligand reduced the primed component of adhesion. Using mAbs against beta(1) or alpha(5), but not alpha(4) integrin subunit, together with anti-beta(2) integrin mAb, reduced stimulated adhesion to basal levels. Cross-linking alpha(5)beta(1) integrin increased alpha(M)beta(2) integrin-dependent adhesion of eosinophils. There are no known adhesion molecule ligands of alpha(5)beta(1) integrin expressed on HBEC; however, fibronectin, the major matrix protein ligand for alpha(5)beta(1) integrin, was detected in association with HBEC monolayers. A mAb against fibronectin, in combination with anti-beta(2) integrin mAb, reduced adhesion to basal levels. In conclusion, alpha(5)beta(1) integrin may provide a contact-dependent costimulus for eosinophil priming that, together with TNF-alpha, potentiated C5a activation of alpha(M)beta(2) integrin and increased eosinophil adhesion to ICAM-1. Fibronectin, associated with HBEC, may act as a ligand for alpha(5)beta(1) integrin. Dual regulation of eosinophil priming may prevent inappropriate activation of eosinophils in the circulation.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2002
10634209,TNF-induced signaling in apoptosis.,"Out of the almost 17 members of the TNF superfamily, TNF is probably the most potent inducer of apoptosis. TNF activates both cell-survival and cell-death mechanisms simultaneously. Activation of NF-kB-dependent genes regulates the survival and proliferative effects pf TNF, whereas activation of caspases regulates the apoptotic effects. TNF-induced apoptosis is mediated primarily through the activation of type I receptors, the death domain of which recruits more than a dozen different signaling proteins, which together are considered part of an apoptotic cascade. This cascade does not, however, account for the role of reactive oxygen intermediates, ceramide, phospholipases, and serine proteases which are also implicated in TNF-induced apoptosis. This cascade also does not explain how type II TNF receptors which lack the death domain, induce apoptosis. Nevertheless, this review of apoptosis signaling will be limited to those proteins that makeup the cascade.",,

These events, in turn, trigger robust, type 1 polarized adaptive immune responses in vivo, suggesting that mDF2beta may play an important role in immunosurveillance against pathogens and, possibly, self antigens or tumor antigens.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2002
9311998,TRAIL-R2: a novel apoptosis-mediating receptor for TRAIL.,"TRAIL is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of cytokines and induces apoptosis in a wide variety of cells. Based on homology searching of a private database, a receptor for TRAIL (DR4 or TRAIL-R1) was recently identified. Here we report the identification of a distinct receptor for TRAIL, TRAIL-R2, by ligand-based affinity purification and subsequent molecular cloning. TRAIL-R2 was purified independently as the only receptor for TRAIL detectable on the surface of two different human cell lines that undergo apoptosis upon stimulation with TRAIL. TRAIL-R2 contains two extracellular cysteine-rich repeats, typical for TNF receptor (TNFR) family members, and a cytoplasmic death domain. TRAIL binds to recombinant cell-surface-expressed TRAIL-R2, and TRAIL-induced apoptosis is inhibited by a TRAIL-R2-Fc fusion protein. TRAIL-R2 mRNA is widely expressed and the gene encoding TRAIL-R2 is located on human chromosome 8p22-21. Like TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2 engages a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway but, in contrast to TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2 mediates apoptosis via the intracellular adaptor molecule FADD/MORT1. The existence of two distinct receptors for the same ligand suggests an unexpected complexity to TRAIL biology, reminiscent of dual receptors for TNF, the canonical member of this family.",The EMBO journal,1997
25268382,Trans-homophilic interaction of CADM1 activates PI3K by forming a complex with MAGuK-family proteins MPP3 and Dlg.,"CADM1 (Cell adhesion molecule 1), a cell adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, is involved in cell-cell interaction and the formation and maintenance of epithelial structure. Expression of CADM1 is frequently downregulated in various tumors derived from epithelial cells. However, the intracellular signaling pathways activated by CADM1-mediated cell adhesion remain unknown. Here, we established a cell-based spreading assay to analyze the signaling pathway specifically activated by the trans-homophilic interaction of CADM1. In the assay, MDCK cells expressing exogenous CADM1 were incubated on the glass coated with a recombinant extracellular fragment of CADM1, and the degree of cell spreading was quantified by measuring their surface area. Assay screening of 104 chemical inhibitors with known functions revealed that LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), efficiently suppressed cell spreading in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibitors of Akt and Rac1, downstream effectors of PI3K, also partially suppressed cell spreading, while the addition of both inhibitors blocked cell spreading to the same extent as did LY294002. Furthermore, MPP3 and Dlg, membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs (MAGuK) proteins, connect CADM1 with p85 of PI3K by forming a multi-protein complex at the periphery of cells. These results suggest that trans-homophilic interaction mediated by CADM1 activates the PI3K pathway to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton and form epithelial cell structure.",PloS one,2014
19252495,Trans-synaptic adhesion between NGL-3 and LAR regulates the formation of excitatory synapses.,"Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate multiple steps of synapse formation and maturation. The great diversity of neuronal synapses predicts the presence of a large number of adhesion molecules that control synapse formation through trans-synaptic and heterophilic adhesion. We identified a previously unknown trans-synaptic interaction between netrin-G ligand-3 (NGL-3), a postsynaptic density (PSD) 95-interacting postsynaptic adhesion molecule, and leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR), a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase. NGL-3 and LAR expressed in heterologous cells induced pre- and postsynaptic differentiation in contacting axons and dendrites of cocultured rat hippocampal neurons, respectively. Neuronal overexpression of NGL-3 increased presynaptic contacts on dendrites of transfected neurons. Direct aggregation of NGL-3 on dendrites induced coclustering of excitatory postsynaptic proteins. Knockdown of NGL-3 reduced the number and function of excitatory synapses. Competitive inhibition by soluble LAR reduced NGL-3-induced presynaptic differentiation. These results suggest that the trans-synaptic adhesion between NGL-3 and LAR regulates excitatory synapse formation in a bidirectional manner.",,
8290257,Transforming activity of a newly cloned androgen-induced growth factor.,"Our previous study demonstrated that androgen-dependent growth of mouse mammary carcinoma cells (SC-3) was mediated through an induction of heparin-binding growth factor, termed as androgen-induced growth factor (AIGF). Here, we report that NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with AIGF expression vector exhibit the abilities of tumor formation in nude mice, focus formation in monolayer culture and colony formation in soft agar. Thus, this newly cloned growth factor can be categorized as an oncogene. In addition, androgen-induced enhancement of DNA synthesis in SC-3 cells can be blocked by simultaneous incubation with AIGF antisense oligonucleotides. The possibility is also addressed that AIGF exerts its biological activity through an interaction with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. Transfection of expression vector encoding a variant form of FGF receptor-1 cloned from SC-3 cells into FGF receptor-negative L6 cells results in AIGF-dependent inhibition of differentiation. These results demonstrate that the ability of androgen to elicit transformed phenotype of SC-3 cells is mediated through AIGF induction and its interaction with FGF receptor-1.",,

12729750,Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) binding to the extracellular domain of the type II TGF-beta receptor: receptor capture on a biosensor surface using a new coiled-coil capture system demonstrates that avidity contributes significantly to high affinity binding.,"Mature TGF-beta isoforms, which are covalent dimers, signal by binding to three types of cell surface receptors, the type I, II and III TGF-beta receptors. A complex composed of the TGF-beta ligand and the type I and II receptors is required for signaling. The type II receptor is responsible for recruiting TGF-beta into the heteromeric ligand/type I receptor/type II receptor complex. The purpose of this study was to test for the extent that avidity contributes to receptor affinity. Using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor (the BIACORE), we captured the extracellular domain of the type II receptor (TbetaRIIED) at the biosensor surface in an oriented and stable manner by using a de novo designed coiled-coil (E/K coil) heterodimerizing system. We characterized the kinetics of binding of three TGF-beta isoforms to this immobilized TbetaRIIED. The results demonstrate that the stoichiometry of TGF-beta binding to TbetaRIIED was one dimeric ligand to two receptors. All three TGF-beta isoforms had rapid and similar association rates, but different dissociation rates, which resulted in the equilibrium dissociation constants being approximately 5pM for the TGF-beta1 and -beta3 isoforms, and 5nM for the TGF-beta2 isoform. Since these apparent affinities are at least four orders of magnitude higher than those determined when TGF-beta was immobilized, and are close to those determined for TbetaRII at the cell surface, we suggest that avidity contributes significantly to high affinity receptor binding both at the biosensor and cell surfaces. Finally, we demonstrated that the coiled-coil immobilization approach does not require the purification of the captured protein, making it an attractive tool for the rapid study of any protein-protein interaction.",Journal of molecular biology,2003

Via their HS chains, syndecans potentiate the action of agouti-related protein and agouti signaling protein, endogenous inhibitors of alphaMSH. In wild-type mice, syndecan-3, the predominantly neural syndecan, is expressed in hypothalamic regions that control energy balance. Food deprivation increases hypothalamic syndecan-3 levels several-fold. Syndecan-3 null mice, otherwise apparently normal, respond to food deprivation with markedly reduced reflex hyperphagia. We propose that oscillation of hypothalamic syndecan-3 levels physiologically modulates feeding behavior.",Cell,2001
23183167,Trefoil factor 2 promotes cell proliferation in pancreatic β-cells through CXCR-4-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation.,"Decreased β-cell mass is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, and therapeutic approaches to increase the pancreatic β-cell mass have been expected. In recent years, gastrointestinal incretin peptides have been shown to exert a cell-proliferative effect in pancreatic β-cells. Trefoil factor 2 (TFF2), which is predominantly expressed in the surface epithelium of the stomach, plays a role in antiapoptosis, migration, and proliferation. The TFF family is expressed in pancreatic β-cells, whereas the role of TFF2 in pancreatic β-cells has been obscure. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which TFF2 enhances pancreatic β-cell proliferation. The effects of TFF2 on cell proliferation were evaluated in INS-1 cells, MIN6 cells, and mouse islets using an adenovirus vector containing TFF2 or a recombinant TFF2 peptide. The forced expression of TFF2 led to an increase in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in both INS-1 cells and islets, without any alteration in insulin secretion. TFF2 significantly increased the mRNA expression of cyclin A2, D1, D2, D3, and E1 in islets. TFF2 peptide increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and BrdU incorporation in MIN6 cells. A MAPK kinase inhibitor (U0126) abrogated the TFF2 peptide-mediated proliferation of MIN6 cells. A CX-chemokine receptor-4 antagonist also prevented the TFF2 peptide-mediated increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and BrdU incorporation in MIN6 cells. These results indicated that TFF2 is involved in β-cell proliferation at least partially via CX-chemokine receptor-4-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting TFF2 may be a novel target for inducing β-cell proliferation.",,
10549288,Triggering cell death: the crystal structure of Apo2L/TRAIL in a complex with death receptor 5.,"Formation of a complex between Apo2L (also called TRAIL) and its signaling receptors, DR4 and DR5, triggers apoptosis by inducing the oligomerization of intracellular death domains. We report the crystal structure of the complex between Apo2L and the ectodomain of DR5. The structure shows three elongated receptors snuggled into long crevices between pairs of monomers of the homotrimeric ligand. The interface is divided into two distinct patches, one near the bottom of the complex close to the receptor cell surface and one near the top. Both patches contain residues that are critical for high-affinity binding. A comparison to the structure of the lymphotoxin-receptor complex suggests general principles of binding and specificity for ligand recognition in the TNF receptor superfamily.",,
17439940,"TrkA receptor ""hot spots"" for binding of NT-3 as a heterologous ligand.","Neurotrophins signal via Trk tyrosine kinase receptors. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is the cognate ligand for TrkA, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor for TrkB, and NT-3 for TrkC. NT-3 also binds TrkA as a lower affinity heterologous ligand. Because neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) interactions with TrkA are biologically relevant, we aimed to define the TrkA ""hot spot"" functional docking sites of NT-3. The Trk extracellular domain consists of two cysteine-rich subdomains (D1 and D3), flanking a leucine-rich subdomain (D2), and two immunoglobulin-like subdomains IgC1(D4) and IgC2(D5). Previously, the D5 subdomain was defined as the primary ligand-binding site of neurotrophins for their cognate receptors (e.g. NGF binds and activates through TRKA-D5 hot spots). Here binding studies with truncated and chimeric extracellular subdomains show that TRKA-D5 also includes an NT-3 docking and activation hot spot (site 1), and competition studies show that the NGF and NT-3 hot spots on TRKA-D5 are distinct but partially overlapping. In addition, ligand binding studies provide evidence for an NT-3-binding/allosteric site on TRKA-D4 (site 2). NT-3 docking on sites 1 and/or 2 partially blocks NGF binding. Functional survival studies showed that sites 1 and 2 regulate TrkA activation. NT-3 docking on both sites 1 and 2 affords full agonism, which can be additive with NGF activation of Trk. However, NT-3 docking solely on site 1 is partially agonistic but noncompetitively antagonizes NGF binding and activation of Trk. This study demonstrates that Trk signaling is more complex than previously thought because it involves several receptor subdomains and hot spots.",,
9182803,"TrnR2, a novel receptor that mediates neurturin and GDNF signaling through Ret.","Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) comprise a family of TGF-beta-related neurotrophic factors (TRNs), which have trophic influences on a variety of neuronal populations. A receptor complex comprised of TrnR1 (GDNFR alpha) and Ret was recently identified and found to be capable of mediating both GDNF and NTN signaling. We have identified a novel receptor based on homology to TrnR1, called TrnR2, that is 48% identical to TrnR1, and is located on the short arm of chromosome 8. TrnR2 is attached to the cell surface via a GPI-linkage, and can mediate both NTN and GDNF signaling through Ret in vitro. Fibroblasts expressing TrnR2 and Ret are approximately 30-fold more sensitive to NTN than to GDNF treatment, whereas those expressing TrnR1 and Ret respond equivalently to both factors, suggesting the TrnR2-Ret complex acts preferentially as a receptor for NTN. TrnR2 and Ret are expressed in neurons of the superior cervical and dorsal root ganglia, and in the adult brain. Comparative analysis of TrnR1, TrnR2, and Ret expression indicates that multiple receptor complexes, capable of mediating GDNF and NTN signaling, exist in vivo.",Neuron,1997
10330424,Truncated apo B-70.5-containing lipoproteins bind to megalin but not the LDL receptor.,"Apo B-100 of LDL can bind to both the LDL receptor and megalin, but the molecular interactions of apo B-100 with these 2 receptors are not completely understood. Naturally occurring mutant forms of apo B may be a source of valuable information on these interactions. Apo B-70.5 is uniquely useful because it contains the NH2-terminal portion of apo B-100, that includes only one of the two putative LDL receptor-binding sites (site A). The lipoprotein containing apo B-70. 5 (Lp B-70.5) was purified from apo B-100/apo B-70.5 heterozygotes by sequential ultracentrifugation combined with immunoaffinity chromatography. Cell culture experiments, ligand blot analysis, and in vivo studies all consistently showed that Lp B-70.5 is not recognized by the LDL receptor. The kidney was identified as a major organ in catabolism of Lp B-70.5 in New Zealand white rabbits. Autoradiographic analysis revealed that renal proximal tubular cells selectively removed Lp B-70.5. On ligand blotting of renal cortical membranes, Lp B-70.5 bound only to megalin. The ability of megalin to mediate cellular endocytosis of Lp B-70.5 was confirmed using retinoic acid/dibutyryl cAMP-treated F9 cells. This study suggests that the putative LDL receptor-binding site A on apo B-100 might not by itself be a functional binding domain and that the apo B-binding sites recognized by the LDL receptor and by megalin may be different. Moreover, megalin may play an important role in renal catabolism of apo B truncations, including apo B-70.5.",The Journal of clinical investigation,1999
9933589,Truncation of macrophage-derived chemokine by CD26/ dipeptidyl-peptidase IV beyond its predicted cleavage site affects chemotactic activity and CC chemokine receptor 4 interaction.,"The serine protease CD26/dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26/DPP IV) and chemokines are known key players in immunological processes. Surprisingly, CD26/DPP IV not only removed the expected Gly1-Pro2 dipeptide from the NH2 terminus of macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) but subsequently also the Tyr3-Gly4 dipeptide, generating MDC(5-69). This second cleavage after a Gly residue demonstrated that the substrate specificity of this protease is less restricted than anticipated. The unusual processing of MDC by CD26/DPP IV was confirmed on the synthetic peptides GPYGANMED (MDC(1-9)) and YGANMED (MDC(3-9)). Compared with intact MDC(1-69), CD26/DPP IV-processed MDC(5-69) had reduced chemotactic activity on lymphocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells, showed impaired mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ through CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), and was unable to desensitize for MDC-induced Ca2+-responses in CCR4 transfectants. However, MDC(5-69) remained equally chemotactic as intact MDC(1-69) on monocytes. In contrast to the reduced binding to lymphocytes and CCR4 transfectants, MDC(5-69) retained its binding properties to monocytes and its anti-HIV-1 activity. Thus, NH2-terminal truncation of MDC by CD26/DPP IV has profound biological consequences and may be an important regulatory mechanism during the migration of Th2 lymphocytes and dendritic cells to germinal centers and to sites of inflammation.",,
11027527,Tryptophan 67 in the human VPAC(1) receptor: crucial role for VIP binding.,"The human receptor subtype for VIP and PACAP, referred to as VPAC(1) receptor, has a large N-terminal extracellular domain which is critical for VIP binding. We further investigated this domain by mutating 12 amino acid residues which could participate in the formation of a tight bend (W67) or a coiled coil motif. They were changed to alanine (A) and the cDNAs were transiently transfected into Cos cells. All mutants but W67A exhibited K(d) values similar to that of the wild-type receptor. For the W67A mutant, no specific (125)I-VIP binding could be observed. Mutants at the W67 site were further characterized after stable transfection of epitope-tagged VPAC(1) receptor-GFP fusion proteins into CHO cells. W67A, W67E, W67H, and W67K mutants neither bound VIP nor mediated adenylyl cyclase activation by VIP. The W67F mutant mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase only at high VIP concentrations. Microscopic analysis and antibody binding experiments showed that all mutants were similarly expressed at the cell surface of CHO cells. Therefore tryptophan 67 in the human VPAC(1) receptor plays a crucial role in VIP binding due, in part, to its aromatic moiety.",,
11981027,TSH receptor interaction with the extracellular matrix: role on constitutive activity and sensitivity to hormonal stimulation.,"Using immunocytochemistry, we have observed that the TSH receptor (TSHR) is concentrated at the leading edge of lamellipodia in both cultured human thyroid cells and in various transfected cells. This segregation of the receptor is due to its interaction with extracellular matrix (ECM) and specially with fibronectin. The TSHR, which interacts with the ECM, is known to undergo cleavage by a matrix metalloprotease. The homologous LH receptor, which does not interact with ECM, is not cleaved. The attachment to the ECM modifies the functional properties of the receptor: it increases adenylate cyclase stimulation by hormone, whereas PLC stimulation is not modified. Furthermore, the constitutive activity of the TSHR is only observed in attached cells, suggesting that it is dependent on TSHR interaction with the ECM. Thus, aside from its classical properties of hormone binding and signalization through G proteins, the TSHR is also involved in cell-matrix interactions, which modulate its functional properties.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",2002
11159842,"Tuberoinfundibular peptide 39 binds to the parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related peptide receptor, but functions as an antagonist.","The tuberoinfundibular peptide TIP39 [TIP-(1-39)], which exhibits only limited amino acid sequence homology with PTH and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), stimulates cAMP accumulation in cells expressing the PTH2 receptor (PTH2R), but it is inactive at the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R). However, when using either (125)I-labeled rat [Nle(8,21),Tyr(34)]PTH-(1-34)amide (rPTH) or (125)I-labeled human [Tyr(36)]PTHrP-(1-36)amide [PTHrP-(1-36)] for radioreceptor studies, TIP-(1-39) bound to LLCPK(1) cells stably expressing the PTH1R (HKrk-B7 cells), albeit with weak apparent affinity (243 +/- 52 and 210 +/- 64 nM, respectively). In comparison to the parent peptide, the apparent binding affinity of TIP-(3-39) was about 3-fold higher, and that of TIP-(9-39) was about 5.5-fold higher. However, despite their improved IC(50) values at the PTH1R, both truncated peptides failed to stimulate cAMP accumulation in HKrk-B7 cells. In contrast, the chimeric peptide PTHrP-(1-20)/TIP-(23-39) bound to HKrk-B7 cells with affinities of 31 +/- 8.2 and 11 +/- 4.0 nM when using radiolabeled rPTH and PTHrP-(1-36), respectively, and it stimulated cAMP accumulation in HKrk-B7 and SaOS-2 cells with potencies (EC(50), 1.40 +/- 0.3 and 0.38 +/- 0.12 nM, respectively) and efficacies (maximum levels, 39 +/- 8 and 31 +/- 3 pmol/well, respectively) similar to those of PTH-(1-34) and PTHrP-(1-36). In both cell lines, TIP(9-39) and, to a lesser extent, TIP-(1-39) inhibited the actions of the three agonists with efficiencies similar to those of [Leu(11),D-Trp(12),Trp(23),Tyr(36)]PTHrP-(7-36)amide, an established PTH1R antagonist. Taken together, the currently available data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal portion of TIP-(1-39) interacts efficiently with the PTH1R, at sites identical to or closely overlapping those used by PTH-(1-34) and PTHrP-(1-36). The amino-terminal residues of TIP-(1-39), however, are unable to interact productively with the PTH1R, thus enabling TIP-(1-39) and some of its truncated analogs to function as an antagonist at this receptor.",Endocrinology,2001
15930094,Tubular expression of angiotensin II receptors and their regulation in IgA nephropathy.,"Enhanced renal expression for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is detected in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Previous data showed an altered glomerular expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), suggesting a regulatory response to high intrarenal angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration in IgAN. In this study, the expression and regulation of Ang II receptors were examined in human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) in IgAN. Tubular expression of AT1R and Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) was increased in IgAN. In vitro culture experiment showed that the upregulation of Ang II receptors was not due to the direct effect of IgA but the indirect effect after IgA deposition on human mesangial cell. When PTEC were cultured with conditioned culture medium from human mesangial cells activated with IgA, Ang II production was upregulated, leading to inflammation and apoptosis via the AT1R and AT2R, respectively. Sequential expression of Ang II receptors determined the injury of PTEC induced by mediators in the conditioned medium. The initial interaction between Ang II and AT1R activated both protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, leading to inflammatory responses. This early AT1R-dependent event was followed by upregulation of AT2R expression and continued Ang II release. The interaction between Ang II and AT2R subsequently led to expression of cleaved poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase through downregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The data suggest that appropriate control of Ang II receptor activities in PTEC may ameliorate tubulointerstitial injury in IgAN.",,
10956646,Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily member TACI is a high affinity receptor for TNF family members APRIL and BLyS.,"An expression cloning approach was employed to identify the receptor for B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and identified the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member TACI as a BLyS-binding protein. Expression of TACI in HEK293T cells confers on the cells the ability to bind BLyS with subnanomolar affinity. Furthermore, a TACI-Fc fusion protein recognizes both the cleaved, soluble form of BLyS as well as the membrane BLyS present on the cell surface of a recombinant cell line. TACI mRNA is found predominantly in B-cells and correlates with BLyS binding in a panel of B-cell lines. We also demonstrate that TACI interacts with nanomolar affinity with the BLyS-related tumor necrosis factor homologue APRIL for which no clear in vivo role has been described. BLyS and APRIL are capable of signaling through TACI to mediate NF-kappaB responses in HEK293 cells. We conclude that TACI is a receptor for BLyS and APRIL and discuss the implications for B-cell biology.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2000
22842346,Tumor-infiltrating DCs suppress nucleic acid-mediated innate immune responses through interactions between the receptor TIM-3 and the alarmin HMGB1.,"The mechanisms by which tumor microenvironments modulate nucleic acid-mediated innate immunity remain unknown. Here we identify the receptor TIM-3 as key in circumventing the stimulatory effects of nucleic acids in tumor immunity. Tumor-associated dendritic cells (DCs) in mouse tumors and patients with cancer had high expression of TIM-3. DC-derived TIM-3 suppressed innate immune responses through the recognition of nucleic acids by Toll-like receptors and cytosolic sensors via a galectin-9-independent mechanism. In contrast, TIM-3 interacted with the alarmin HMGB1 to interfere with the recruitment of nucleic acids into DC endosomes and attenuated the therapeutic efficacy of DNA vaccination and chemotherapy by diminishing the immunogenicity of nucleic acids released from dying tumor cells. Our findings define a mechanism whereby tumor microenvironments suppress antitumor immunity mediated by nucleic acids.",Nature immunology,2012
12787562,"TWEAK, a member of the TNF superfamily, is a multifunctional cytokine that binds the TweakR/Fn14 receptor.","The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) was initially described as a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily in 1997. TWEAK is a cell surface-associated type II transmembrane protein, but a smaller, biologically active form can also be shed into the extracellular milieu. There is one receptor currently known to bind TWEAK with physiological affinity, and it is a type I transmembrane protein that is referred to in the literature as either TWEAK receptor (TweakR) or fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14). TweakR/Fn14 is the smallest member of the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily described to date, and it appears to signal via recruitment of several different TNFR-associated factors. TWEAK has multiple biological activities, including stimulation of cell growth and angiogenesis, induction of inflammatory cytokines, and under some experimental conditions, stimulation of apoptosis. In this report, we summarize the results from recent studies focused on the TWEAK cytokine. Although these studies have contributed a significant amount of new information, numerous questions still remain regarding the role of TWEAK in both normal physiology and the pathogenesis of human disease.",,
8955347,Two aromatic residues regulate the response of the human oxytocin receptor to the partial agonist arginine vasopressin.,"We investigated the mechanisms that regulate the efficacy of agonists in the arginine-vasopressin (AVP)/oxytocin (OT) receptor system. In this paper, we present evidence that AVP, a full agonist of the vasopressin receptors, acts as a partial agonist on the oxytocin receptor. We also found that AVP becomes a full agonist when two aromatic residues of the oxytocin receptor are replaced by the residues present at equivalent positions in the vasopressin receptor subtypes. Our results indicate that these two residues modulate the response of the oxytocin receptor to the partial agonist AVP.",FEBS letters,1996
14691232,Two different proteins that compete for binding to thrombin have opposite kinetic and thermodynamic profiles.,"Thrombin binds thrombomodulin (TM) at anion binding exosite 1, an allosteric site far from the thrombin active site. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been isolated that competes with TM for binding to thrombin. Complete binding kinetic and thermodynamic profiles for these two protein-protein interactions have been generated. Binding kinetics were measured by Biacore. Although both interactions have similar K(D)s, TM binding is rapid and reversible while binding of the mAb is slow and nearly irreversible. The enthalpic contribution to the DeltaG(bind) was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry and van't Hoff analysis. The contribution to the DeltaG(bind) from electrostatic steering was assessed from the dependence of the k(a) on ionic strength. Release of solvent H(2)O molecules from the interface was assessed by monitoring the decrease in amide solvent accessibility at the interface upon protein-protein binding. The mAb binding is enthalpy driven and has a slow k(d). TM binding appears to be entropy driven and has a fast k(a). The favorable entropy of the thrombin-TM interaction seems to be derived from electrostatic steering and a contribution from solvent release. The two interactions have remarkably different thermodynamic driving forces for competing reactions. The possibility that optimization of binding kinetics for a particular function may be reflected in different thermodynamic driving forces is discussed.",,
14607932,Two novel fully functional isoforms of CX3CR1 are potent HIV coreceptors.,"We identified two novel isoforms of the human chemokine receptor CX3CR1, produced by alternative splicing and with N-terminal regions extended by 7 and 32 aa. Expression of the messengers coding these isoforms, compared with that of previously described V28 messengers, is lower in monocytes and NK cells, but higher in CD4(+) T lymphocytes. CX3CR1 and its extended isoforms were expressed in HEK-293 cells and compared for expression, ligand binding, and cellular responses. In steady state experiments, all three CX3CR1 isoforms bound CX3CL1 with similar affinity. In kinetic binding studies, however, k(on) and k(off) were significantly greater for the extended CX3CR1 isoforms, thereby suggesting that the N-terminal extensions may alter the functions induced by CX3CL1. In signaling studies, all three CX3CR1 isoforms mediated agonist-dependent calcium mobilization, but the EC(50) was lower for the extended than for the standard isoforms. In addition, chemotactic responses for these extended isoforms shifted left, also indicating a more sensitive response. Finally, the longer variants appeared to be more potent HIV coreceptors when tested in fusion and infection assays. In conclusion, we identified and characterized functionally two novel isoforms of CX3CR1 that respond more sensitively to CX3CL1 and HIV viral envelopes. These data reveal new complexity in CX3CR1 cell activation and confirm the critical role of the N-terminal domain of the chemokine receptors in ligand recognition and cellular response.",,
11039935,Two-amino acid molecular switch in an epithelial morphogen that regulates binding to two distinct receptors.,"Ectodysplasin, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, is encoded by the anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) gene. Mutations in EDA give rise to a clinical syndrome characterized by loss of hair, sweat glands, and teeth. EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are two isoforms of ectodysplasin that differ only by an insertion of two amino acids. This insertion functions to determine receptor binding specificity, such that EDA-A1 binds only the receptor EDAR, whereas EDA-A2 binds only the related, but distinct, X-linked ectodysplasin-A2 receptor (XEDAR). In situ binding and organ culture studies indicate that EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are differentially expressed and play a role in epidermal morphogenesis.",,
11157754,"Type III TGF-beta receptor-independent signalling of TGF-beta2 via TbetaRII-B, an alternatively spliced TGF-beta type II receptor.","Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signals through membrane-bound serine/threonine kinase receptors, which upon stimulation phosphorylate Smad proteins and thereby trigger their nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Although the three mammalian isoforms of TGF-beta are highly homologous at the level of sequence, analysis of their in vivo function by gene knockouts revealed striking differences, suggesting no significant functional redundancy between TGF-beta1, -2 and -3. While signal transduction by TGF-beta1 has been well characterized, receptor binding and activation by the TGF-beta2 isoform is less well understood. Here, we show that TbetaRII-B, an alternatively spliced variant of the TGF-beta type II receptor, is a TGF-beta2 binding receptor, which mediates signalling via the Smad pathway in the absence of any TGF-beta type III receptor (TbetaRIII). L6 cells lacking endogenous TbetaRIII as well as TbetaRII-B do not respond to TGF-beta2. Transfection of these cells with TbetaRII-B restores TGF-beta2 sensitivity. The expression of TbetaRII-B is restricted to cells originating from tissues such as bone where the isoform TGF-beta2 has a predominant role. This reflects the importance of this receptor in TGF-beta isoform-specific signalling.",The EMBO journal,2001
10666376,Type VIII collagen stimulates smooth muscle cell migration and matrix metalloproteinase synthesis after arterial injury.,"Type VIII collagen is a matrix protein expressed in a number of tissues undergoing active remodeling, including injured arteries during neointimal formation and in human atherosclerotic plaques; however, very little is known about its function. We have investigated whether the type VIII collagen stimulates smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and invasion by binding to integrin receptors and up-regulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production. SMCs attached to plates coated with type VIII collagen in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal attachment occurring with coating solutions containing 25 microgram/ml collagen. Type VIII collagen at 100 microgram/ml stimulated an 83-fold increase in the migration of SMCs in a chemotaxis chamber. Antibodies against beta1 integrin receptors prevented attachment and migration of SMCs. Antibodies against alpha1 or alpha2 integrins reduced attachment of SMCs to type VIII collagen by 29% and 77%, respectively. We found that SMCs grown from the rat neointima, but not medial SMCs, increased their production of MMP-2 and -9 on adherence to type VIII collagen. This suggests that there is an important difference in phenotype between intimal and medial SMCs and that intimal SMCs have distinct matrix-dependent signaling mechanisms. Our findings suggest that type VIII collagen deposited in vascular lesions functions to promote SMC attachment and chemotaxis, and signals through integrin receptors to stimulate MMP synthesis, all of which are important mechanisms used in cell migration and invasion.",,
7774575,Tyr115 is the key residue for determining agonist selectivity in the V1a vasopressin receptor.,"Using a three-dimensional model of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), we have previously succeeded in docking the neurohypophysial hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) into the V1a receptor. According to this model, the hormone is completely embedded in the transmembrane part of the receptor. Only the side chain of the Arg residue at position 8 projects outside the transmembrane core of the receptor and possibly interacts with a Tyr residue located in the first extracellular loop at position 115. Residue 8 varies in the two natural neurohypophysial hormones, AVP and oxytocin (OT); similarly, different residues are present at position 115 in the different members of the AVP/OT receptor family. Here we show that Arg8 is crucial for high affinity binding of AVP to the rat V1a receptor. Moreover, when Tyr115 is replaced by an Asp and a Phe, the amino acids naturally occurring in the V2 and in the OT receptor subtypes, the agonist selectivity of the V1a receptor switches accordingly. Our results indicate that the interaction between peptide residue 8 and the receptor residue at position 115 is not only crucial for agonist high affinity binding but also for receptor selectivity.",The EMBO journal,1995
9442088,Tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain of the erythropoietin receptor mediate activation of AP-1 transcription factors.,"Binding of erythropoietin (Epo) to the Epo receptor (EpoR) initiates a signaling cascade resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins and induction of AP-1 transcription factor(s). While Epo is known to activate c-fos gene expression, the mechanism of AP-1 activation is unknown. Here we show that AP-1 activation by Epo requires tyrosine kinase activity and also de novo protein synthesis. Using a mutant EpoR containing no cytosolic tyrosine residues, and a set of eight mutants containing a single cytosolic tyrosine residue, we show that multiple EpoR tyrosines, thought to activate multiple intracellular signal transduction proteins, can mediate AP-1 activation. An EpoR containing only tyrosine 343 or tyrosine 464 supports a maximal level of AP-1 activation. We also show that AP-1 activation does not require maximal STAT5 activation and may occur via a STAT5-independent signaling pathway.",The Journal of biological chemistry,1998
6270680,Ubiquitous cell-surface glycoprotein on tumor cells is proliferation-associated receptor for transferrin.,"A murine monoclonal antibody (OKT9) raised against human leukemic cells binds to a wide variety of leukemia and tumor cell lines and to a minority of leukemia cells taken directly from patients. Fetal thymus and liver are strongly reactive as are some normal, immature hemopoietic cells and activated lymphocytes. Reactivity with OKT9 appears to correlate with proliferation status in both normal and malignant populations. Biochemical analysis indicates that this structure is a approximately equal to 180,000-dalton glycoprotein with two disulfide-bonded subunits of approximately equal to 90,000-daltons. Isolation of the transferrin receptor from a T-cell line (MOLT-4) indicates that it also has a dimeric approximately equal to 180,000-dalton structure. Radio-labeled transferrin bound to its receptors can be specifically precipitated by the monoclonal OKT9, although the latter does not bind transferrin itself, indicating that the antigenic structure defined by this antibody is likely to be the transferrin receptor.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1981
12732206,ULBP4 is a novel ligand for human NKG2D.,"The ULBPs are a family of MHC class I-related molecules. We have previously shown that ULBPs 1, 2, and 3 are functional ligands of the NKG2D/DAP10 receptor complex on human natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we describe a new member of the ULBP family, ULBP4, which contains predicted transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, unlike the other ULBPs, which are GPI-linked proteins. Transduction of ULBP4 into EL4 cells confers the ability to bind recombinant NKG2D and mediates increased cytotoxic activity by human NK cells, consistent with the role of ULBPs as ligands for the NKG2D/DAP10 activating receptors. Tissue expression of ULBP4 differs from other members of the family, in that it is expressed predominantly in the skin.",,
11239445,"ULBPs, novel MHC class I-related molecules, bind to CMV glycoprotein UL16 and stimulate NK cytotoxicity through the NKG2D receptor.","The human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein, UL16, binds to two members of a novel family of molecules, the ULBPs, and to the MHC class I homolog, MICB. The ULBPs are GPI-linked glycoproteins belonging to the extended MHC class I family but are only distantly related to MICB. The ULBP and MICB molecules are ligands for the activating receptor, NKG2D/DAP10, and this interaction is blocked by a soluble form of UL16. The ULBPs stimulate cytokine and chemokine production from NK cells, and expression of ULBPs in NK cell-resistant target cells confers susceptibility to NK cell cytotoxicity.

The two carboxyl-terminal valine residues of WT are replaced by 5 (GCRLY) or 4 (ATLG) amino acids in VaI or VaII, respectively. When overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, VaI and ValI, but not WT, support autonomous growth. We detected tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 in the absence of serum, in CHO cells expressing WT, VaI, or VaII, but not in mock transfectants. These observations prompted us to investigate possible interactions between the ErbBs and the TGF-alpha precursors in CHO cells. All TGF-alpha precursors were found to co-immunoprecipitate with the ErbBs, but with different specificity. WT co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB4, but not with ErbB1, ErbB2, or ErbB3. VaI and VaII co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB2, but not with ErbB1, ErbB3, or ErbB4. Confocal fluorescent microscopy analysis demonstrated that WT, VaI, and VaII all distribute equally to the cell surface while, as expected, a WT mutant lacking the two C-terminal valine residues does not. Point and deletion mutants involving the unique carboxyl-terminal residues of WT, VaI and VaII, indicated that the interactions between the three TGF-alpha precursors and the ErbBs were mediated by their carboxyl-terminal regions, which constitute distinct protein-binding motifs. A chimera of the intracellular domain of WT TGF-alpha linked to exogenous transmembrane and extracellular domains retained both the cell surface distribution and the specific interaction with ErbB4 of full-length WT, confirming that this interaction is mediated by the C-terminus of the TGF-alpha precursor. While interactions of WT and variant TGF-alpha with the ErbBs all result in ErbB2 activation, they produce different biological consequences, suggesting that the various TGF-alpha precursors differentially modulate ErbB signaling.",Oncogene,2000
21402696,Unique interaction pattern for a functionally biased ghrelin receptor agonist.,"Based on the conformationally constrained D-Trp-Phe-D-Trp (wFw) core of the prototype inverse agonist [D-Arg(1),D-Phe(5),D-Trp(7,9),Leu(11)]substance P, a series of novel, small, peptide-mimetic agonists for the ghrelin receptor were generated. By using various simple, ring-constrained spacers connecting the D-Trp-Phe-D-Trp motif with the important C-terminal carboxyamide group, 40 nm agonism potency was obtained and also in one case (wFw-Isn-NH(2), where Isn is isonipecotic acid) ~80% efficacy. However, in contrast to all previously reported ghrelin receptor agonists, the piperidine-constrained wFw-Isn-NH(2) was found to be a functionally biased agonist. Thus, wFw-Isn-NH(2) mediated potent and efficacious signaling through the Gα(q) and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, but in contrast to all previous ghrelin receptor agonists it did not signal through the serum response element, conceivably the Gα(12/13) pathway. The recognition pattern of wFw-Isn-NH(2) with the ghrelin receptor also differed significantly from that of all previously characterized unbiased agonists. Most importantly, wFw-Isn-NH(2) was not dependent on GluIII:09 (Glu3.33), which otherwise is an obligatory TM III anchor point residue for ghrelin agonists. Molecular modeling and docking experiments indicated that wFw-Isn-NH(2) binds in the classical agonist binding site between the extracellular segments of TMs III, VI, and VII, interacting closely with the aromatic cluster between TMs VI and VII, but that it does so in an opposite orientation as compared with, for example, the wFw peptide agonists. It is concluded that the novel peptide-mimetic ligand wFw-Isn-NH(2) is a biased ghrelin receptor agonist and that the selective signaling pattern presumably is due to its unique receptor recognition pattern lacking interaction with key residues especially in TM III.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2011

Given that TGM2 interaction with syndecan-4 (SDC4) on the cell surface is important in the activation of ITGB1 and integrin-mediated survival signaling, we investigated the roles of TGM2, ITGB1, and SDC4 in the development and metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).",,
16219802,Up-regulation of the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 inhibits VEGF-induced endothelial cell function.,"Delta-like 4 (Dll4), a membrane-bound ligand for Notch1 and Notch4, is selectively expressed in the developing endothelium and in some tumor endothelium, and it is induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and hypoxia. Gene targeting studies have shown that Dll4 is required for normal embryonic vascular remodeling, but the mechanisms underlying Dll4 regulatory functions are currently not defined. In this study, we generated primary human endothelial cells that overexpress Dll4 protein to study Dll4 function and mechanism of action. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells retrovirally transduced with Dll4 displayed reduced proliferative and migratory responses selectively to VEGF-A. Expression of VEGF receptor-2, the principal signaling receptor for VEGF-A in endothelial cells, and coreceptor neuropilin-1 was significantly decreased in Dll4-transduced endothelial cells. Consistent with Dll4 signaling through Notch, expression of HEY2, one of the transcription factors that mediates Notch function, was significantly induced in Dll4-overexpressing endothelial cells. The gamma-secretase inhibitor L-685458 significantly reconstituted endothelial cell proliferation inhibited by immobilized extracellular Dll4 and reconstituted VEGFR2 expression in Dll4-overexpressing endothelial cells. These results identify the Notch ligand Dll4 as a selective inhibitor of VEGF-A biologic activities down-regulating 2 VEGF receptors expressed on endothelial cells and raise the possibility that Dll4 may be exploited therapeutically to modulate angiogenesis.",Blood,2006
11226328,Urocortin II: a member of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neuropeptide family that is selectively bound by type 2 CRF receptors.,"Here we describe the cloning and initial characterization of a previously unidentified CRF-related neuropeptide, urocortin II (Ucn II). Searches of the public human genome database identified a region with significant sequence homology to the CRF neuropeptide family. By using homologous primers deduced from the human sequence, a mouse cDNA was isolated from whole brain poly(A)(+) RNA that encodes a predicted 38-aa peptide, structurally related to the other known mammalian family members, CRF and Ucn. Ucn II binds selectively to the type 2 CRF receptor (CRF-R2), with no appreciable activity on CRF-R1. Transcripts encoding Ucn II are expressed in discrete regions of the rodent central nervous system, including stress-related cell groups in the hypothalamus (paraventricular and arcuate nuclei) and brainstem (locus coeruleus). Central administration of 1-10 microg of peptide elicits activational responses (Fos induction) preferentially within a core circuitry subserving autonomic and neuroendocrine regulation, but whose overall pattern does not broadly mimic the CRF-R2 distribution. Behaviorally, central Ucn II attenuates nighttime feeding, with a time course distinct from that seen in response to CRF. In contrast to CRF, however, central Ucn II failed to increase gross motor activity. These findings identify Ucn II as a new member of the CRF family of neuropeptides, which is expressed centrally and binds selectively to CRF-R2. Initial functional studies are consistent with Ucn II involvement in central autonomic and appetitive control, but not in generalized behavioral activation.",,
7477349,"Urocortin, a mammalian neuropeptide related to fish urotensin I and to corticotropin-releasing factor.","Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a peptide first isolated from mammalian brain, is critical in the regulation of the pituitary-adrenal axis, and in complementary stress-related endocrine, autonomic and behavioural responses. Fish urotensin I and amphibian sauvagine were considered to be homologues of CRF until peptides even more closely related to CRF were identified in these same vertebrate classes. We have characterized another mammalian member of the CRF family and have localized its urotensin-like immunoreactivity to, and cloned related complementary DNAs from, a discrete rat midbrain region. The deduced protein encodes a peptide that we name urocortin, which is related to urotensin (63% sequence identity) and CRF (45% sequence identity). Synthetic urocortin evokes secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) both in vitro and in vivo and binds and activates transfected type-1 CRF receptors, the subtype expressed by pituitary corticotropes. The coincidence of urotensin-like immunoreactivity with type-2 CRF receptors in brain, and our observation that urocortin is more potent than CRF at binding and activating type-2 CRF receptors, as well as at inducing c-Fos (an index of cellular activation) in regions enriched in type-2 CRF receptors, indicate that this new peptide could be an endogenous ligand for type-2 CRF receptors.",Nature,1995

Although touted as the most potent vasoconstrictor peptide yet identified, the responses elicited by U-II are species-, tissue- and endothelium-dependent. Available data question the contribution of U-II to resting cardiovascular homeostasis in humans; instead they point to a role for this hormone in disease (heart failure and cardiac cell growth, renal function, diabetes, and mitogenesis in vascular and tumour cells). Key features of these diseases are increased expression and activity of U-II receptors. In this review, we focus on recent evidence that supports a role of U-II and its receptor in cardiovascular disease.",Trends in endocrinology and metabolism: TEM,2004
8026467,Utilization of the beta and gamma chains of the IL-2 receptor by the novel cytokine IL-15.,"We have recently cloned a novel cytokine, IL-15, with shared bioactivities but no sequence homology with IL-2. We found high affinity IL-15 binding to many cell types, including cells of non-lymphoid origin. Analysis of IL-15 interaction with subunits of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) revealed that the alpha subunit was not involved in IL-15 binding. We demonstrated directly in cells transfected with IL-2R subunits that both the beta and gamma chains are required for IL-15 binding and signaling. Hence, IL-15, like IL-2, IL-4 and IL-7, utilizes the common IL-2R gamma subunit found to be defective in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency in humans. IL-15 is the only cytokine other than IL-2 that has also been shown to share the beta signaling subunit of IL-2R. The differential ability of some cells to bind and respond to IL-2 and IL-15 implies the existence of an additional IL-15-specific component.",The EMBO journal,1994

Norrin, the protein product of the Norrie disease gene, is a secreted protein of unknown biochemical function. One form of FEVR is caused by defects in Frizzled-4 (Fz4), a presumptive Wnt receptor. We show here that Norrin and Fz4 function as a ligand-receptor pair based on (1) the similarity in vascular phenotypes caused by Norrin and Fz4 mutations in humans and mice, (2) the specificity and high affinity of Norrin-Fz4 binding, (3) the high efficiency with which Norrin induces Fz4- and Lrp-dependent activation of the classical Wnt pathway, and (4) the signaling defects displayed by disease-associated variants of Norrin and Fz4. These data define a Norrin-Fz4 signaling system that plays a central role in vascular development in the eye and ear, and they indicate that ligands unrelated to Wnts can act through Fz receptors.",Cell,2004
15637071,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A165-induced prostacyclin synthesis requires the activation of VEGF receptor-1 and -2 heterodimer.,"We previously reported that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A(165) inflammatory effect is mediated by acute platelet-activating factor synthesis from endothelial cells upon the activation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and its coreceptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). In addition, VEGF-A(165) promotes the release of other endothelial mediators including nitric oxide and prostacyclin (PGI(2)). However, it is unknown whether VEGF-A(165) is mediating PGI(2) synthesis through VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and/or VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) activation and whether the coreceptor NRP-1 potentiates VEGF-A(165) activity. In this study, PGI(2) synthesis in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) was assessed by quantifying its stable metabolite (6-keto prostaglandin F(1alpha), 6-keto PGF(1alpha)) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment of BAEC with VEGF analogs, VEGF-A(165) (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 agonist) and VEGF-A(121) (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonist) (up to 10(-9) m), increased PGI(2) synthesis by 70- and 40-fold within 15 min. Treatment with VEGFR-1 (placental growth factor and VEGF-B) or VEGFR-2 (VEGF-C) agonist did not increase PGI(2) synthesis. The combination of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonists did not increase PGI(2) release. Pretreatment with a VEGFR-2 inhibitor abrogated PGI(2) release mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121), and pretreatment of BAEC with antisense oligomers targeting VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 mRNA reduced PGI(2) synthesis mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121) up to 79%. In summary, our data demonstrate that the activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 heterodimer (VEGFR-1/R-2) is essential for PGI(2) synthesis mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121), which cannot be reproduced by the parallel activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 homodimers with corresponding agonists. In addition, the binding of VEGF-A(165) to NRP-1 potentiates its capacity to promote PGI(2) synthesis.",,
10233851,Vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor induce expression of CXCR4 on human endothelial cells: In vivo neovascularization induced by stromal-derived factor-1alpha.,"The contribution of chemokines toward angiogenesis is currently a focus of intensive investigation. Certain members of the CXC chemokine family can induce bovine capillary endothelial cell migration in vitro and corneal angiogenesis in vivo, and apparently act via binding to their receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. We used an RNAse protection assay that permitted the simultaneous detection of mRNA for various CXC chemokine receptors in resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and detected low levels of only CXCR4 mRNA. Stimulation of HUVECs with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) up-regulated levels of only CXCR4 mRNA. CXCR4 specifically binds the chemokine stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha). Competitive binding studies using 125I-labeled SDF-1alpha with Scatchard analysis indicated that VEGF or bFGF induced an average number of approximately 16,600 CXCR4 molecules per endothelial cell, with a Kd = 1.23 x 10(-9) mol/L. These receptors were functional as HUVECs and human aorta endothelial cells (HAECs) migrated toward SDF-1alpha. Although SDF-1alpha-induced chemotaxis was inhibited by the addition of a neutralizing monoclonal CXCR4 antibody, endothelial chemotaxis toward VEGF was not altered; therefore, the angiogenic effect of VEGF is independent of SDF-1alpha. Furthermore, subcutaneous SDF-1alpha injections into mice induced formation of local small blood vessels that was accompanied by leukocytic infiltrates. To test whether these effects were dependent on circulating leukocytes, we successfully obtained SDF-1alpha-induced neovascularization from cross sections of leukocyte-free rat aorta. Taken together, our data indicate that SDF-1alpha acts as a potent chemoattractant for endothelial cells of different origins bearing CXCR4 and is a participant in angiogenesis that is regulated at the receptor level by VEGF and bFGF.",,
9751730,Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) binds to VEGF receptor-1 and regulates plasminogen activator activity in endothelial cells.,"The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family has recently expanded by the identification and cloning of three additional members, namely VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. In this study we demonstrate that VEGF-B binds selectively to VEGF receptor-1/Flt-1. This binding can be blocked by excess VEGF, indicating that the interaction sites on the receptor are at least partially overlapping. Mutating the putative VEGF receptor-1/Flt-1 binding determinants Asp63, Asp64, and Glu67 to alanine residues in VEGF-B reduced the affinity to VEGF receptor-1 but did not abolish binding. Mutational analysis of conserved cysteines contributing to VEGF-B dimer formation suggest a structural conservation with VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor. Proteolytic processing of the 60-kDa VEGF-B186 dimer results in a 34-kDa dimer containing the receptor-binding epitopes. The binding of VEGF-B to its receptor on endothelial cells leads to increased expression and activity of urokinase type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, suggesting a role for VEGF-B in the regulation of extracellular matrix degradation, cell adhesion, and migration.",,
9435229,Vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) is a ligand for the tyrosine kinases VEGF receptor 2 (Flk1) and VEGF receptor 3 (Flt4).,"We have identified a member of the VEGF family by computer-based homology searching and have designated it VEGF-D. VEGF-D is most closely related to VEGF-C by virtue of the presence of N- and C-terminal extensions that are not found in other VEGF family members. In adult human tissues, VEGF-D mRNA is most abundant in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, colon, and small intestine. Analyses of VEGF-D receptor specificity revealed that VEGF-D is a ligand for both VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) VEGFR-2 (Flk1) and VEGFR-3 (Flt4) and can activate these receptors. However. VEGF-D does not bind to VEGFR-1. Expression of a truncated derivative of VEGF-D demonstrated that the receptor-binding capacities reside in the portion of the molecule that is most closely related in primary structure to other VEGF family members and that corresponds to the mature form of VEGF-C. In addition, VEGF-D is a mitogen for endothelial cells. The structural and functional similarities between VEGF-D and VEGF-C define a subfamily of the VEGFs.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1998
8700872,Vascular endothelial growth factor-related protein: a ligand and specific activator of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt4.,"The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.",,
15690488,Vascular-specific growth factor angiopoietin 1 is involved in the organization of neuronal processes.,"Neuronal processes and vessels have similar branching and bifurcation patterning in the adult body and appear to use many of the same molecules during their development, including vascular endothelial growth factor, Notch, neuropilin, and ephrins/Ephs. We were interested in determining whether the endothelial growth factor angiopoietin (Ang) has a unique role in the nervous system in addition to its angiogenic role. By using a mouse molecular genetics approach, we overexpressed Ang1 in the mouse forebrain and observed increases in overall vascularization, consistent with prior reports describing the role of Ang1. Nonvascular events, involving alterations in the dendritic organization of layer II motor cortex neurons, dentate granule cells, and pyramidal cells of CA1, were seen, suggesting that Ang1 was able to influence the growth of these processes. The angiopoietin tyrosine kinase receptor Tie2 was not found on neurons or their processes, but beta1 integrin was and has previously been found to act as an Ang receptor. Our findings provide some of the first data evaluating the interactions between the developing nervous system and the vascular protein Ang1. Understanding interactions between the developing nervous and vascular systems will lead to novel insight into how the two systems interact throughout development, during senescence, and in disease.",,
15247411,"Vasorin, a transforming growth factor beta-binding protein expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, modulates the arterial response to injury in vivo.","Growth factors, cell-surface receptors, adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix proteins play critical roles in vascular pathophysiology by affecting growth, migration, differentiation, and survival of vascular cells. In a search for secreted and cell-surface molecules expressed in the cardiovascular system, by using a retrovirus-mediated signal sequence trap method, we isolated a cell-surface protein named vasorin. Vasorin is a typical type I membrane protein, containing tandem arrays of a characteristic leucine-rich repeat motif, an epidermal growth factor-like motif, and a fibronectin type III-like motif at the extracellular domain. Expression analyses demonstrated that vasorin is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, and that its expression is developmentally regulated. To clarify biological functions of vasorin, we searched for its binding partners and found that vasorin directly binds to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and attenuates TGF-beta signaling in vitro. Vasorin expression was down-regulated during vessel repair after arterial injury, and reversal of vasorin down-regulation, by using adenovirus-mediated in vivo gene transfer, significantly diminished injury-induced vascular lesion formation, at least in part, by inhibiting TGF-beta signaling in vivo. These results suggest that down-regulation of vasorin expression contributes to neointimal formation after vascular injury and that vasorin modulates cellular responses to pathological stimuli in the vessel wall. Thus, vasorin is a potential therapeutic target for vascular fibroproliferative disorders.",,
19435808,VASP is a CXCR2-interacting protein that regulates CXCR2-mediated polarization and chemotaxis.,"Chemotaxis regulates the recruitment of leukocytes, which is integral for a number of biological processes and is mediated through the interaction of chemokines with seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors. Several studies have indicated that chemotactic signaling pathways might be activated via G-protein-independent mechanisms, perhaps through novel receptor-interacting proteins. CXCR2 is a major chemokine receptor expressed on neutrophils. We used a proteomics approach to identify unique ligand-dependent CXCR2-interacting proteins in differentiated neutrophil-like HL-60 cells. Using this approach, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) was identified as a CXCR2-interacting protein. The interaction between CXCR2 and VASP is direct and enhanced by CXCL8 stimulation, which triggers VASP phosphorylation via PKA- and PKCdelta-mediated pathways. The interaction between CXCR2 and VASP requires free F-actin barbed ends to recruit VASP to the leading edge. Finally, knockdown of VASP in HL-60 cells results in severely impaired CXCR2-mediated chemotaxis and polarization. These data provide the first demonstration that direct interaction of VASP with CXCR2 is essential for proper CXCR2 function and demonstrate a crucial role for VASP in mediating chemotaxis in leukocytes.",,
10050855,Vertebrate Hedgehog signalling modulated by induction of a Hedgehog-binding protein.,"The Hedgehog signalling pathway is essential for the development of diverse tissues during embryogenesis. Signalling is activated by binding of Hedgehog protein to the multipass membrane protein Patched (Ptc). We have now identified a novel component in the vertebrate signalling pathway, which we name Hip (for Hedgehog-interacting protein) because of its ability to bind Hedgehog proteins. Hip encodes a membrane glycoprotein that binds to all three mammalian Hedgehog proteins with an affinity comparable to that of Ptc-1. Hip-expressing cells are located next to cells that express each Hedgehog gene. Hip expression is induced by ectopic Hedgehog signalling and is lost in Hedgehog mutants. Thus, Hip, like Ptc-1, is a general transcriptional target of Hedgehog signalling. Overexpression of Hip in cartilage, where Indian hedgehog (Ihh) controls growth, leads to a shortened skeleton that resembles that seen when Ihh function is lost (B. St-Jacques, M. Hammerschmidt & A.P.M., in preparation). Our findings support a model in which Hip attenuates Hedgehog signalling as a result of binding to Hedgehog proteins: a negative regulatory feedback loop established in this way could thus modulate the responses to any Hedgehog signal.",,
9126742,Vertebrate homologues of C. elegans UNC-5 are candidate netrin receptors.,"In the developing nervous system, migrating cells and axons are guided to their targets by cues in the extracellular environment. The netrins are a family of phylogenetically conserved guidance cues that can function as diffusible attractants and repellents for different classes of cells and axons. In vertebrates, insects and nematodes, members of the DCC subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily have been implicated as receptors that are involved in migration towards netrin sources. The mechanisms that direct migration away from netrin sources (presumed repulsions) are less well understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the transmembrane protein UNC-5 (ref. 14) has been implicated in these responses, as loss of unc-5 function causes migration defects and ectopic expression of unc-5 in some neurons can redirect their axons away from a netrin source. Whether UNC-5 is a netrin receptor or simply an accessory to such a receptor has not, however, been defined. We now report the identification of two vertebrate homologues of UNC-5 which, with UNC-5 and the product of the mouse rostral cerebellar malformation gene (rcm), define a new subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and whose messenger RNAs show prominent expression in various classes of differentiating neurons. We provide evidence that these two UNC-5 homologues, as well as the rcm gene product, are netrin-binding proteins, supporting the hypothesis that UNC-5 and its relatives are netrin receptors.",,
19057841,Vicious cycle between myeloma cell binding to bone marrow stromal cells via VLA-4-VCAM-1 adhesion and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha and MIP-1beta production.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) cell adhesion to stromal cells via very late antigen (VLA)-4 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 interaction causes enhanced secretion of osteoclastogenic activity by MM cells. We have reported that MM cell-derived macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta are responsible for most of the osteoclastogenic activity in MM. Thus, adhesion-mediated osteoclastogenesis may be caused by enhanced production of MIP-1 via VLA-4-VCAM-1 interaction. The present study was undertaken to clarify whether MM cell-derived MIP-1 plays a role in VLA-4-VCAM-1 adhesion-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Adhesion of MM cells to VCAM-1 upregulated MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta production from MM cells and enhanced production of osteoclastogenic activity by MM cells. Blockade of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta actions not only abrogated elaboration of osteoclastogenic activity, but also suppressed spontaneous MM cell adhesion to VCAM-1. These results demonstrate that MM cell adhesion to VCAM-1 upregulates MIP-1 production by MM cells to cause enhancement of osteoclastogenesis. In addition, the results suggest that the increased production of MIP-1 further enhances MM cell binding to stromal cells via stimulation of VLA-4-VCAM-1 adhesion, forming a ""vicious cycle"" between MM cell adhesion to stromal cells and MIP-1 production via VLA-4-VCAM-1 interaction.",,
15604363,Visfatin: a protein secreted by visceral fat that mimics the effects of insulin.,"Fat tissue produces a variety of secreted proteins (adipocytokines) with important roles in metabolism. We isolated a newly identified adipocytokine, visfatin, that is highly enriched in the visceral fat of both humans and mice and whose expression level in plasma increases during the development of obesity. Visfatin corresponds to a protein identified previously as pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), a 52-kilodalton cytokine expressed in lymphocytes. Visfatin exerted insulin-mimetic effects in cultured cells and lowered plasma glucose levels in mice. Mice heterozygous for a targeted mutation in the visfatin gene had modestly higher levels of plasma glucose relative to wild-type littermates. Surprisingly, visfatin binds to and activates the insulin receptor. Further study of visfatin's physiological role may lead to new insights into glucose homeostasis and/or new therapies for metabolic disorders such as diabetes.",,
30220083,VSIG-3 as a ligand of VISTA inhibits human T-cell function.,"B7 family members and their receptors play a central role in the regulation of T-cell responses through T-cell co-stimulation and co-inhibition pathways that constitute attractive targets for the development of immunotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we report that VSIG-3/IGSF11 is a ligand of B7 family member VISTA/PD-1H and inhibits human T-cell functions through a novel VSIG-3/VISTA pathway. An extensive functional ELISA binding screening assay reveals that VSIG-3 binds to the new B7 family member VISTA but does not interact with other known members of the B7 family. Under the same experimental conditions, we did not observe any significant interaction between VSIG-8 and VISTA. In addition, VSIG-3 inhibits human T-cell proliferation in the presence of T-cell receptor signaling. Furthermore, VSIG-3 significantly reduces cytokine and chemokine production by human T cells including IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-17, CCL5/Rantes, CCL3/MIP-1α, and CXCL11/I-TAC. Anti-VISTA neutralization antibodies attenuate the binding of VSIG-3 and VISTA, as well as VSIG-3-induced T-cell inhibition. Hence, we have identified a novel ligand for VISTA that is able to inhibit human T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. This unique VSIG-3/VISTA co-inhibitory pathway may provide new strategies for the treatment of human cancers, autoimmune disorders, infection, and transplant rejection and may aid in the design of better vaccines.",,
22753465,Wnt pathway inhibition via the targeting of Frizzled receptors results in decreased growth and tumorigenicity of human tumors.,"The Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which signals through the Frizzled (Fzd) receptor family and several coreceptors, has long been implicated in cancer. Here we demonstrate a therapeutic approach to targeting the Wnt pathway with a monoclonal antibody, OMP-18R5. This antibody, initially identified by binding to Frizzled 7, interacts with five Fzd receptors through a conserved epitope within the extracellular domain and blocks canonical Wnt signaling induced by multiple Wnt family members. In xenograft studies with minimally passaged human tumors, this antibody inhibits the growth of a range of tumor types, reduces tumor-initiating cell frequency, and exhibits synergistic activity with standard-of-care chemotherapeutic agents.",,
15265686,Wnt-4 activates the canonical beta-catenin-mediated Wnt pathway and binds Frizzled-6 CRD: functional implications of Wnt/beta-catenin activity in kidney epithelial cells.,"The Wnt signaling pathway is central to the development of all animals and to cancer progression, yet largely unknown are the pairings of secreted Wnt ligands to their respective Frizzled transmembrane receptors or, in many cases, the relative contributions of canonical (beta-catenin/LEF/TCF) versus noncanonical Wnt signals. Specifically, in the kidney where Wnt-4 is essential for the mesenchymal to epithelial transition that generates the tissue's collecting tubules, the corresponding Frizzled receptor(s) and downstream signaling mechanism(s) are unclear. In this report, we addressed these issues using Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, which are competent to form tubules in vitro. Employing established reporter constructs of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activity, we have determined that MDCK cells are highly responsive to Wnt-4, -1, and -3A, but not to Wnt-5A and control conditions, precisely reflecting functional findings from Wnt-4 null kidney mesenchyme ex vivo rescue studies. We have confirmed that Wnt-4's canonical signaling activity in MDCK cells is mediated by downstream effectors of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway using beta-Engrailed and dnTCF-4 constructs that suppress this pathway. We have further found that MDCK cells express the Frizzled-6 receptor and that Wnt-4 forms a biochemical complex with the Frizzled-6 CRD. Since Frizzled-6 did not appear to transduce Wnt-4's canonical signal, data supported recently by Golan et al., there presumably exists another as yet unknown Frizzled receptor(s) mediating Wnt-4 activation of beta-catenin/LEF/TCF. Finally, we report that canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signals cells help maintain cell growth and survival in MDCK cells but do not contribute to standard HGF-induced (nonphysiologic) tubule formation. Our results in combination with work from Xenopus laevis (not shown) lead us to believe that Wnt-4 binds both canonical and noncanonical Frizzled receptors, thereby activating Wnt signaling pathways that may each contribute to kidney tubulogenesis.",,
24032637,WNT/Frizzled signalling: receptor-ligand selectivity with focus on FZD-G protein signalling and its physiological relevance: IUPHAR Review 3.,"The wingless/int1 (WNT)/Frizzled (FZD) signalling pathway controls numerous cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, cell-fate decisions, migration and plays a crucial role during embryonic development. Nineteen mammalian WNTs can bind to 10 FZDs thereby activating different downstream pathways such as WNT/β-catenin, WNT/planar cell polarity and WNT/Ca(2+) . However, the mechanisms of signalling specification and the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins are still unclear. Disturbances in the pathways can lead to various diseases ranging from cancer, inflammatory diseases to metabolic and neurological disorders. Due to the presence of seven-transmembrane segments, evidence for coupling between FZDs and G proteins and substantial structural differences in class A, B or C GPCRs, FZDs were grouped separately in the IUPHAR GPCR database as the class FZD within the superfamily of GPCRs. Recently, important progress has been made pointing to a direct activation of G proteins after WNT stimulation. WNT/FZD and G protein coupling remain to be fully explored, although the basic observation supporting the nature of FZDs as GPCRs is compelling. Because the involvement of different (i) WNTs; (ii) FZDs; and (iii) intracellular binding partners could selectively affect signalling specification, in this review we present the current understanding of receptor/ligand selectivity of FZDs and WNTs. We pinpoint what is known about signalling specification and the physiological relevance of these interactions with special emphasis on FZD-G protein interactions.",British journal of pharmacology,2014
34911552,WNT11/ROR2 signaling is associated with tumor invasion and poor survival in breast cancer.,"Breast cancer has been associated with activation of the WNT signaling pathway, although no driver mutations in WNT genes have been found yet. Instead, a high expression of the alternative WNT receptor ROR2 was observed, in particular in breast cancer brain metastases. However, its respective ligand and downstream signaling in this context remained unknown.",Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,2021
26861315,Wnt16 Signaling Is Required for IL-1β-Induced Matrix Metalloproteinase-13-Regulated Proliferation of Human Stem Cell-Derived Osteoblastic Cells.,"We established a differentiation method for homogeneous α7 integrin-positive human skeletal muscle stem cell (α7⁺hSMSC)-derived osteoblast-like (α7⁺hSMSC-OB) cells, and found that interleukin (IL)-1β induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13-regulated proliferation of these cells. These data suggest that MMP-13 plays a potentially unique physiological role in the regeneration of osteoblast-like cells. Here, we examined whether up-regulation of MMP-13 activity by IL-1β was mediated by Wingless/int1 (Wnt) signaling and increased the proliferation of osteoblast-like cells. IL-1β increased the mRNA and protein levels of Wnt16 and the Wnt receptor Lrp5/Fzd2. Exogenous Wnt16 was found to increase MMP-13 mRNA, protein and activity, and interestingly, the proliferation rate of these cells. Treatment with small interfering RNAs against Wnt16 and Lrp5 suppressed the IL-1β-induced increase in cell proliferation. We revealed that a unique signaling cascade IL-1β→Wnt16→Lrp5→MMP-13, was intimately involved in the proliferation of osteoblast-like cells, and suggest that IL-1β-induced MMP-13 expression and changes in cell proliferation are regulated by Wnt16.",International journal of molecular sciences,2016
18302287,"Wnt2 acts as a cell type-specific, autocrine growth factor in rat hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells cross-stimulating the VEGF pathway.","The mechanisms regulating the growth and differentiation of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs) are not well defined. Because Wnt signaling has become increasingly important in developmental processes such as vascular and hepatic differentiation, we analyzed HSEC-specific Wnt signaling in detail. Using highly pure HSECs isolated by a newly developed protocol selecting against nonsinusoidal hepatic endothelial cells, we comparatively screened the multiple components of the Wnt pathway for differential expression in HSECs and lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMECs) via reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). As confirmed via quantitative RT-PCR and northern and western blotting experiments, Wnt2 (and less so Wnt transporter wls/evi) and Wnt coreceptor Ryk were overexpressed by HSECs, whereas Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF) was strongly overexpressed by LMECs. Exogenous Wnt2 superinduced proliferation of HSECs (P < 0.05). The Wnt inhibitor secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) (P < 0.005) and transfection of HSECs with Wnt2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced proliferation of HSECs. These effects were rescued by exogenous Wnt2. Tube formation of HSECs on matrigel was strongly inhibited by Wnt inhibitors sFRP1 and WIF (P < 0.0005). Wnt signaling in HSECs activated the canonical pathway inducing nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. GST (glutathione transferase) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed Fzd4 to be a novel Wnt2 receptor in HSECs. Gene profiling identified vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) as a target of Wnt2 signaling in HSECs. Inhibition of Wnt signaling down-regulated VEGFR-2 messenger RNA and protein. Wnt2 siRNA knock-down confirmed Wnt2 specificity of VEGFR-2 regulation in HSECs.",,
21128903,Wnt3a stimulation elicits G-protein-coupled receptor properties of mammalian Frizzled proteins.,"Receptors of the Fz (Frizzled) family initiate Wnt ligand-dependent signalling controlling multiple steps in organism development and carcinogenesis. Fz proteins possess seven transmembrane domains, and their signalling depends on heterotrimeric G-proteins in various organisms; however, Fz proteins constitute a distinct group within the GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor) superfamily, and Fz signalling can be G-protein-independent in some experimental setups, leading to concerns about the GPCR nature of these proteins. In the present study, we demonstrate that mammalian Fz proteins act as GPCRs on heterotrimeric G(o/i) proteins. Addition of the Wnt3a ligand to rat brain membranes or cultured cells elicits Fz-dependent guanine-nucleotide exchange on G(o/i) proteins. These responses were sensitive to a Wnt antagonist and to pertussis toxin, which decouples the G(o/i) proteins from their receptors through covalent modification. The results of the present study provide the long-awaited biochemical proof of the GPCR nature of Fz receptors.",The Biochemical journal,2011
21541287,Wnt4 enhances murine hematopoietic progenitor cell expansion through a planar cell polarity-like pathway.,"While the role of canonical (β-catenin-mediated) Wnt signaling in hematolymphopoiesis has been studied extensively, little is known of the potential importance of non-canonical Wnt signals in hematopoietic cells. Wnt4 is one of the Wnt proteins that can elicit non-canonical pathways. We have previously shown that retroviral overexpression of Wnt4 by hematopoietic cells increased thymic cellularity as well as the frequency of early thymic progenitors and bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). However, the molecular pathways responsible for its effect in HPCs are not known.",PloS one,2011
19910923,Wnt5a regulates distinct signalling pathways by binding to Frizzled2.,"Wnt5a regulates multiple intracellular signalling cascades, but how Wnt5a determines the specificity of these pathways is not well understood. This study examined whether the internalization of Wnt receptors affects the ability of Wnt5a to regulate its signalling pathways. Wnt5a activated Rac in the beta-catenin-independent pathway, and Frizzled2 (Fz2) and Ror1 or Ror2 were required for this action. Fz2 was internalized through a clathrin-mediated route in response to Wnt5a, and inhibition of clathrin-dependent internalization suppressed the ability of Wnt5a to activate Rac. As another action of Wnt5a, it inhibited Wnt3a-dependent lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) phosphorylation and beta-catenin accumulation. Wnt3a-dependent phosphorylation of LRP6 was enhanced in Wnt5a knockout embryonic fibroblasts. Fz2 was also required for the Wnt3a-dependent accumulation of beta-catenin, and Wnt5a competed with Wnt3a for binding to Fz2 in vitro and in intact cells, thereby inhibiting the beta-catenin pathway. This inhibitory action of Wnt5a was not affected by the impairment of clathrin-dependent internalization. These results suggest that Wnt5a regulates distinct pathways through receptor internalization-dependent and -independent mechanisms.",The EMBO journal,2010
24335906,Wnt5a uses CD146 as a receptor to regulate cell motility and convergent extension.,"Dysregulation of Wnt signalling leads to developmental defects and diseases. Non-canonical Wnt signalling via planar cell polarity proteins regulates cell migration and convergent extension; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we report that Wnt5a uses CD146 as a receptor to regulate cell migration and zebrafish embryonic convergent extension. CD146 binds to Wnt5a with the high affinity required for Wnt5a-induced activation of Dishevelled (Dvl) and c-jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK). The interaction between CD146 and Dvl2 is enhanced on Wnt5a treatment. Mutation of the Dvl2-binding region impairs its ability to activate JNK, promote cell migration and facilitate the formation of cell protrusions. Knockdown of Dvls impairs CD146-induced cell migration. Interestingly, CD146 inhibits canonical Wnt signalling by promoting β-catenin degradation. Our results suggest a model in which CD146 acts as a functional Wnt5a receptor in regulating cell migration and convergent extension, turning off the canonical Wnt signalling branch.",,
21518267,"Wnt5a: its signalling, functions and implication in diseases.","Wnt5a is a representative ligand that activates the β-catenin-independent pathways. Because the β-catenin-independent pathway includes multiple signalling cascades in addition to the planar cell polarity and Ca(2+) pathway, Wnt5a regulates a variety of cellular functions, such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, adhesion and polarity. Consistent with the multiple functions of Wnt5a signalling, Wnt5a knockout mice show various phenotypes, including an inability to extend the embryonic anterior-posterior and proximal-distal axes in outgrowth tissues. Thus, many important roles of Wnt5a in developmental processes have been demonstrated. Moreover, recent reports suggest that the postnatal abnormalities in the Wnt5a signalling are involved in various diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory diseases and metabolic disorders. Therefore, Wnt5a and its signalling pathways could be important targets for the diagnosis and therapy for human diseases.",,
27122540,Wnt6 regulates epithelial cell differentiation and is dysregulated in renal fibrosis.,"Diabetic nephropathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus, manifesting as mesangial expansion, glomerular basement membrane thickening, glomerular sclerosis, and progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis leading to end-stage renal disease. Here we describe the functional characterization of Wnt6, whose expression is progressively lost in diabetic nephropathy and animal models of acute tubular injury and renal fibrosis. We have shown prominent Wnt6 and frizzled 7 (FzD7) expression in the mesonephros of the developing mouse kidney, suggesting a role for Wnt6 in epithelialization. Importantly, TCF/Lef reporter activity is also prominent in the mesonephros. Analysis of Wnt family members in human renal biopsies identified differential expression of Wnt6, correlating with severity of the disease. In animal models of tubular injury and fibrosis, loss of Wnt6 was evident. Wnt6 signals through the canonical pathway in renal epithelial cells as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of GSK3β (Ser9), nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and increased TCF/Lef transcriptional activity. FzD7 was identified as a putative receptor of Wnt6. In vitro Wnt6 expression leads to de novo tubulogenesis in renal epithelial cells grown in three-dimensional culture. Importantly, Wnt6 rescued epithelial cell dedifferentiation in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β); Wnt6 reversed TGF-β-mediated increases in vimentin and loss of epithelial phenotype. Wnt6 inhibited TGF-β-mediated p65-NF-κB nuclear translocation, highlighting cross talk between the two pathways. The critical role of NF-κB in the regulation of vimentin expression was confirmed in both p65(-/-) and IKKα/β(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts. We propose that Wnt6 is involved in epithelialization and loss of Wnt6 expression contributes to the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis.",American journal of physiology. Renal physiology,2016
15923619,"Wnt7b activates canonical signaling in epithelial and vascular smooth muscle cells through interactions with Fzd1, Fzd10, and LRP5.","Wnt7b is a Wnt ligand that has been demonstrated to play critical roles in several developmental processes, including lung airway and vascular development and chorion-allantois fusion during placental development. Wnt signaling involves the binding of Wnt ligands to cell surface receptors of the frizzled family and coreceptors of the LRP5/6 family. However, little is known of the ligand-receptor specificity exhibited by different Wnts, Fzds, and LRPs in Wnt signaling. Expression analysis of Fzds and LRP5/6 in the developing lung and vasculature showed that Fzd1, -4, -7, and -10 and LRP5/6 are expressed in tissue-specific patterns during lung development. Fzd1, -4, and -7 are expressed primarily in the developing lung mesenchyme, and Fzd10 is expressed in airway epithelium. LRP5 and LRP6 are expressed in airway epithelium during lung development, whereas LRP5 but not LRP6 expression is observed in the muscular component of large blood vessels, including the aorta. Cell transfection studies demonstrate that Wnt7b can activate the canonical Wnt pathway but not the noncanonical Wnt pathway in a cell-specific manner. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that Wnt7b can bind to Fzd1 and -10 on the cell surface and cooperatively activate canonical Wnt signaling with these receptors in the presence of LRP5. Together, these data demonstrate that Wnt7b signals through Fzd1 and -10 and LRP5 and implicate these Wnt coreceptors in the regulation of lung airway and vascular development.",Molecular and cellular biology,2005

Here, we used preparations from human and from wild-type (WT), Y(4), and Y(1) receptor knockout ((-/-)) mice, alongside Y(4) receptor-transfected cells to define the relative functional contribution of the Y(4) receptor. First, rat (r) PP antisecretory responses were lost in murine Y(4)(-/-) preparations, but hPP and Pro(34) peptide YY (PYY) costimulated Y(4) and Y(1) receptors in WT mucosa. The Y(1) antagonist/Y(4) agonist GR231118 [(Ile,Glu,Pro,Dpr,Tyr,Arg,Leu,Arg,Try-NH(2))-2-cyclic(2,4'),(2',4)-diamide] elicited small Y(4)-mediated antisecretory responses in human tissues pretreated with the Y(1) antagonist, BIBO3304 [(R)-N-[[4-(aminocarbonylaminomethyl)-phenyl]methyl]-N(2)-(diphenylacetyl)-argininamide trifluoroacetate)], and attenuated Y(4)-mediated hPP responses in mouse and human mucosa. GR231118 and rPP were also antisecretory in hY(4)-transfected epithelial monolayers but were partial agonists compared with hPP at this receptor. In Y(4)-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, Y(4) ligands displaced [(125)I]hPP binding with orders of affinity (pK(i)) at human (hPP = rPP > GR231118 > Pro(34)PYY = PYY) and mouse (rPP = hPP > GR231118 > Pro(34)PYY > PYY) Y(4) receptors. GR231118- and rPP-stimulated guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding through hY(4) receptors with significantly lower efficacy than hPP. GR231118 marginally increased basal but abolished further PP-induced hY(4) internalization to recycling (transferrin-labeled) pathways in HEK293 cells. Taken together, these findings show that Y(4) receptors play a definitive role in attenuating colonic anion transport and may be useful targets for novel antidiarrheal agents due to their limited peripheral expression.",,
9686591,Zinc bound to the killer cell-inhibitory receptor modulates the negative signal in human NK cells.,"The lysis of target cells by human NK cells is inhibited by several kinds of receptors with varying specificities for the MHC class I molecules of target cells. The requirements for complete inhibition of NK cytotoxicity appear to be complex and not well defined. The HLA-C-specific members of the killer cell-inhibitory receptor (KIR) family, carrying two Ig domains (KIR2D), are unusual among Ig superfamily members in their ability to bind zinc. A role for the zinc-binding site in KIR-mediated inhibition was demonstrated in this study using a functional reconstitution system in NK cells. Replacement of six histidines by alanine residues in putative zinc binding sites of a KIR2D ablated zinc binding and markedly impaired its inhibitory function, but left intact its ability to bind HLA-C and to transduce a positive signal through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif grafted onto its cytoplasmic tail. Thus, zinc modulates specifically the negative signal transmitted by this KIR molecule. Mutation of an exposed amino-terminal zinc-binding motif alone was sufficient to impair the inhibitory function of KIR. The data suggest that complete inhibition of HLA-C-specific NK cells requires a zinc-dependent protein-protein interaction via the amino-terminal end of KIR2D.",,
23341447,β-Arrestin recruitment and G protein signaling by the atypical human chemokine decoy receptor CCX-CKR.,"Chemokine receptors form a large subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors that predominantly activate heterotrimeric Gi proteins and are involved in immune cell migration. CCX-CKR is an atypical chemokine receptor with high affinity for CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 chemokines, but is not known to activate intracellular signaling pathways. However, CCX-CKR acts as decoy receptor and efficiently internalizes these chemokines, thereby preventing their interaction with other chemokine receptors, like CCR7 and CCR9. Internalization of fluorescently labeled CCL19 correlated with β-arrestin2-GFP translocation. Moreover, recruitment of β-arrestins to CCX-CKR in response to CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 was demonstrated using enzyme-fragment complementation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer methods. To unravel why CCX-CKR is unable to activate Gi signaling, CCX-CKR chimeras were constructed by substituting its intracellular loops with the corresponding CCR7 or CCR9 domains. The signaling properties of chimeric CCX-CKR receptors were characterized using a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-driven reporter gene assay. Unexpectedly, wild type CCX-CKR and a subset of the chimeras induced an increase in CRE activity in response to CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 in the presence of the Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin. CCX-CKR signaling to CRE required an intact DRY motif. These data suggest that inactive Gi proteins impair CCX-CKR signaling most likely by hindering the interaction of this receptor with pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins that transduce signaling to CRE. On the other hand, recruitment of the putative signaling scaffold β-arrestin to CCX-CKR in response to chemokines might allow activation of yet to be identified signal transduction pathways.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2013
10189055,Tachykinin receptors on human monocytes: their involvement in rheumatoid arthritis,"Three types of tachykinin receptors, namely NK1, NK2 and NK3, are known to preferentially interact with substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB), respectively. Experimental evidence indicates that SP and NKA modulate the activity of inflammatory and immune cells, including mononuclear ones. This study evaluated the effects of mammalian tachykinins and selective tachykinin agonists and antagonists on human monocytes isolated from healthy donors: SP, NKA and NKB all evoked a dose-dependent superoxide anion (O2-) production and the NK2 selective agonist [beta-Ala8]-NKA(4-10) induced a full response. The NK3 selective agonist senktide was inactive, while the NK1 selective agonists septide and [Sar9Met(O2)11]SP displayed some effects. These results indicate that NK2 and also some NK1 receptors are present in monocytes isolated from healthy donors. The role of tachykinin receptor activation in rheumatoid arthritis was also investigated, by measuring O2- production and TNF-alpha mRNA expression in monocytes isolated from rheumatoid patients. Tachykinins enhanced the expression of this cytokine in both control and rheumatoid monocytes and NK2 receptor stimulation was shown to trigger an enhanced respiratory burst in monocytes from rheumatoid patients. In conclusion, these results indicate that NK2 and NK1 receptors are present on human monocytes, the former being preferentially involved in rheumatoid arthritis.",Neuropeptides,1998
35605991,GPR83 engages endogenous peptides from two distinct precursors to elicit differential signaling,"PEN is an abundant neuropeptide that activates GPR83, a G protein-coupled receptor that is considered a novel therapeutic target due to its roles in regulation of feeding, reward, and anxiety-related behaviors. The major form of PEN in the brain is 22 residues in length. Previous studies have identified shorter forms of PEN in mouse brain and neuroendocrine cells; these shorter forms were named PEN18, PEN19 and PEN20, with the number reflecting the length of the peptide. The C-terminal five residues of PEN20 are identical to the C-terminus of a procholecystokinin (proCCK)-derived peptide, named proCCK56-62, that is present in mouse brain. ProCCK56-62 is highly conserved across species although it has no homology to the bioactive cholecystokinin domain. ProCCK56-62 and a longer form, proCCK56-63 were tested for their ability to engage GPR83. Both peptides bind GPR83 with high affinity, activate second messenger pathways, and induce ligand-mediated receptor endocytosis. Interestingly, the shorter PEN peptides, ProCC56-62, and ProCCK56-63 differentially activate signal transduction pathways. Whereas PEN22 and PEN20 facilitate receptor coupling to Gai, PEN18, PEN19 and ProCCK peptides facilitate coupling to Gas. Furthermore, the ProCCK peptides exhibit dose dependent Ga subtype selectivity in that they faciliate coupling to Gas at low concentrations and Gai at high concentrations. These data demonstrate that peptides derived from two distinct peptide precursors can differentially activate GPR83, and that GPR83 exhibits Ga subtype preference depending on the nature and concentration of the peptide. These results are consistent with the emerging idea that endogenous neuropeptides function as biased ligands.",Mol. Pharmacol.,2022
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.27.501694v1,Galectin-8 is a major ligand of LILRB4 prompting MDSC functions in the tumor microenvironment,"The LILRB4 myeloid receptor has been implicated in an immunosuppressive microenvironment, with specific antibodies under preclinical or clinical development for tumor immunotherapy. However, it remains largely unknown which natural ligand may trigger LILRB4 to expand myeloid derived suppressive cells (MDSC), and the relevant downstream signaling pathways are also under debate. Here we show that Galectin-8 is a high-affinity functional ligand of LILRB4, and its ligation induces MDSC by activating STAT3 as well as inhibiting NF-κB. Importantly, Galectin-8 but not APOE could induce MDSC, and both ligands bind LILRB4 in a non-competitive manner. Antibodies recognizing a defined epitope on LILRB4 could efficiently block Galectin-8 binding and neutralize its effects on MDSC induction and relevant signaling pathways. Galectin-8 expression promoted B16 tumor growth in mice, and knockout of LILRB4 attenuated tumor growth in this context. The LILRB4-specific Galectin-8 blocking antibody efficiently suppressed MDSC expansion and tumor growth in vivo. These results identify Galectin-8 as a functionally important ligand of LILRB4, highlighting the blockade of LILRB4-Galectin-8 interaction as a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy.",Biorxiv,2024
