Extracellular activation of these complexes is a critical but incompletely understood step in regulation of TGF beta function in vivo. We show that TGF beta 1 LAP is a ligand for the integrin alpha v beta 6 and that alpha v beta 6-expressing cells induce spatially restricted activation of TGF beta 1. This finding explains why mice lacking this integrin develop exaggerated inflammation and, as we show, are protected from pulmonary fibrosis. These data identify a novel mechanism for locally regulating TGF beta 1 function in vivo by regulating expression of the alpha v beta 6 integrin.',\n",

Here we report the identification of a new member, activation-inducible TNFR family member (AITR), which belongs to this subfamily, and its ligand. The receptor is expressed in lymph node and peripheral blood leukocytes, and its expression is up-regulated in human peripheral mononuclear cells mainly after stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin. AITR associates with TRAF1 (TNF receptor-associated factor 1), TRAF2, and TRAF3, and induces nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation via TRAF2. The ligand for AITR (AITRL) was found to be an undescribed member of the TNF family, which is expressed in endothelial cells. Thus, AITR and AITRL seem to be important for interactions between activated T lymphocytes and endothelial cells.',\n",
       " '10037743': \"CD44 has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, but the mechanism(s) involved is as yet poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that CD44 isoforms containing the alternatively spliced exon v3 carry heparan sulfate side chains and are able to bind heparin-binding growth factors. In the present study, we have explored the possibility of a physical and functional interaction between CD44 and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), the ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met. The HGF/SF-c-Met pathway mediates cell growth and motility and has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. We demonstrate that a CD44v3 splice variant efficiently binds HGF/SF via its heparan sulfate side chain. To address the functional relevance of this interaction, Namalwa Burkitt's lymphoma cells were stably co-transfected with c-Met and either CD44v3 or the isoform CD44s, which lacks heparan sulfate. We show that, as compared with CD44s, CD44v3 promotes: (i) HGF/SF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met, (ii) phosphorylation of several downstream proteins, and (iii) activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and -2. By heparitinase treatment and the use of a mutant HGF/SF with greatly decreased affinity for heparan sulfate, we show that the enhancement of c-Met signal transduction induced by CD44v3 was critically dependent on heparan sulfate moieties. Our results identify heparan sulfate-modified CD44 (CD44-HS) as a functional co-receptor for HGF/SF which promotes signaling through the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met, presumably by concentrating and presenting HGF/SF. As both CD44-HS and c-Met are overexpressed on several types of tumors, we propose that the observed functional collaboration might be instrumental in promoting tumor growth and metastasis.\",\n",
       " '10050855': 'The Hedgehog signalling pathway is essential for the development of diverse tissues during embryogenesis. Signalling is activated by binding of Hedgehog protein to the multipass membrane protein Patched (Ptc). We have now identified a novel component in the vertebrate signalling pathway, which we name Hip (for Hedgehog-interacting protein) because of its ability to bind Hedgehog proteins. Hip encodes a membrane glycoprotein that binds to all three mammalian Hedgehog proteins with an affinity comparable to that of Ptc-1. Hip-expressing cells are located next to cells that express each Hedgehog gene. Hip expression is induced by ectopic Hedgehog signalling and is lost in Hedgehog mutants. Thus, Hip, like Ptc-1, is a general transcriptional target of Hedgehog signalling. Overexpression of Hip in cartilage, where Indian hedgehog (Ihh) controls growth, leads to a shortened skeleton that resembles that seen when Ihh function is lost (B. St-Jacques, M. Hammerschmidt & A.P.M., in preparation). Our findings support a model in which Hip attenuates Hedgehog signalling as a result of binding to Hedgehog proteins: a negative regulatory feedback loop established in this way could thus modulate the responses to any Hedgehog signal.',\n",

The angiopoietins include a naturally occurring agonist, angiopoietin-1, as well as a naturally occurring antagonist, angiopoietin-2, both of which act by means of the Tie2 receptor. We now report our attempts to use homology-based cloning approaches to identify new members of the angiopoietin family. These efforts have led to the identification of two new angiopoietins, angiopoietin-3 in mouse and angiopoietin-4 in human; we have also identified several more distantly related sequences that do not seem to be true angiopoietins, in that they do not bind to the Tie receptors. Although angiopoietin-3 and angiopoietin-4 are strikingly more structurally diverged from each other than are the mouse and human versions of angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2, they appear to represent the mouse and human counterparts of the same gene locus, as revealed in our chromosomal localization studies of all of the angiopoietins in mouse and human. The structural divergence of angiopoietin-3 and angiopoietin-4 appears to underlie diverging functions of these counterparts. Angiopoietin-3 and angiopoietin-4 have very different distributions in their respective species, and angiopoietin-3 appears to act as an antagonist, whereas angiopoietin-4 appears to function as an agonist.',\n",

The molecular signals that confer target specificity of different dopaminergic neurons are not known. We now report that EphB1 and ephrin-B2, a receptor and ligand of the Eph family, are candidate guidance molecules for the development of these distinct pathways. EphB1 and ephrin-B2 are expressed in complementary patterns in the midbrain dopaminergic neurons and their targets, and the ligand specifically inhibits the growth of neurites and induces the cell loss of substantia nigra, but not ventral tegmental, dopaminergic neurons. These studies suggest that the ligand-receptor pair may contribute to the establishment of distinct neural pathways by selectively inhibiting the neurite outgrowth and cell survival of mistargeted neurons. In addition, we show that ephrin-B2 expression is upregulated by cocaine and amphetamine in adult mice, suggesting that ephrin-B2/EphB1 interaction may play a role in drug-induced plasticity in adults as well.',\n",

The mechanism of Lp(a) atherogenicity as well as its catabolic pathways are only incompletely understood at present. In this report, we show that the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family member megalin/glycoprotein (gp) 330 is capable of binding and mediating the cellular uptake and degradation of Lp(a) in vitro. A mouse embryonic yolk sac cell line with native expression of megalin/gp330 but genetically deficient in LDLR-related protein (LRP) and a control cell line carrying a double knockout for both LRP and megalin/gp330 were compared with regard to their ability to bind, internalize, and degrade dioctadecyltetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI)-fluorescence-labeled Lp(a) as well as equimolar amounts of 125I-labeled Lp(a) and LDL. Uptake and degradation of radiolabeled Lp(a) by the megalin/gp330-expressing cells were, on average, 2-fold higher than that of control cells. This difference could be completely abolished by addition of the receptor-associated protein, an inhibitor of ligand binding to megalin/gp330. Mutual suppression of the uptake of 125I-Lp(a) and of 125I-LDL by both unlabeled Lp(a) and LDL suggested that Lp(a) uptake is mediated at least partially by apolipoprotein B100. Binding and uptake of DiI-Lp(a) resulted in strong signals on megalin/gp330-expressing cells versus background only on control cells. In addition, we show that purified megalin/gp330, immobilized on a sensor chip, directly binds Lp(a) in a Ca2+-dependent manner with an affinity similar to that for LDL. We conclude that megalin/gp330 binds Lp(a) in vitro and is capable of mediating its cellular uptake and degradation.',\n",

We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8].

To gain insight into the biochemical basis of this genetic interaction, we tested the possibility that presenilin-1 (PS1) physically associates with the Notch1 receptor in mammalian cells. Notch1 and PS1 coimmunoprecipitated from transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cell lysates in a detergent-sensitive manner, consistent with a noncovalent physical association between the two proteins. The interaction predominantly occurred early in the secretory pathway prior to Notch cleavage in the Golgi, because PS1 immunoprecipitation preferentially recovered the full-length Notch1 precursor. When PS1 was immunoprecipitated from 293 cells that had been metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, Notch1 was the primary protein detected in PS1 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that this interaction is specific. Furthermore, endogenous Notch and presenilin coimmunoprecipitated from cultured Drosophila cells, indicating that physical interaction can occur at physiological expression levels. These results suggest that the genetic relationship between presenilins and the Notch signaling pathway derives from a direct physical association between these proteins in the secretory pathway.\",\n",

Here we have studied AR and EGF mitogenic signaling in EGFR-devoid NR6 fibroblasts that ectopically express either wild type EGFR (WT) or a truncated EGFR that lacks the three major sites of autophosphorylation (c'1000). COOH-terminal truncation of the EGFR significantly impairs the ability of AR to (i) stimulate DNA synthesis, (ii) elicit Elk-1 transactivation, and (iii) generate sustained enzymatic activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. EGFR truncation had no significant effect on AR binding to receptor but did result in defective GRB2 adaptor function. In contrast, EGFR truncation did not impair EGF mitogenic signaling, and in c'1000 cells EGF was able to stimulate the association of ErbB2 with GRB2 and SHC. Elk-1 transactivation was monitored when either ErbB2 or a truncated dominant-negative ErbB2 mutant (ErbB2-(1-813)) was overexpressed in cells. Overexpression of full-length ErbB2 resulted in a strong constitutive transactivation of Elk-1 in c'1000 but only slightly stimulated Elk-1 in WT or parental NR6 cells. Conversely, overexpression of ErbB2-(1-813) inhibited EGF-stimulated Elk-1 transactivation in c'1000 but not in WT cells. Thus, the cytoplasmic tail of the EGFR plays a critical role in AR mitogenic signaling but is dispensable for EGF, since EGF-activated truncated EGFRs can signal through ErbB2.\",\n",
       " '10100920': 'Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) interacts with three types of PACAP/VIP-receptors. The PAC1-receptor accepts PACAP as a high affinity ligand but not vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) similarly binding to VPAC1- and VPAC2-receptors. To identify those amino acids not present in VIP defining PAC1-receptor selectivity of PACAP, radio receptor binding assays on AR4-2J cells were performed. It could be shown that PACAP(1-27) exhibited a distinct and much higher susceptibility to VIP-amino acid substitutions, compared to PACAP(1-38). Positions 4 and 5 seem to be most important for receptor binding of PACAP(1-27), whereas position 13 was identified to be crucial for maximal affinity of PACAP(1-38). PACAP(29-38) extension analogues of VIP revealed a stabilizing effect of the C-terminus of PACAP(1-38) on the optimal peptide conformation. The substitution analogues were also checked for their capacity to stimulate IP3 and cAMP formation in AR4-2J cells. Compared to PACAP(1-27) and PACAP(1-38), most analogues revealed potencies reduced congruously to their lower binding affinities. However, one of the analogues, PACAP(1-27) substituted in position 5, may represent a weak antagonist since this peptide was less potent in inducing second messengers than in label displacement. Our findings indicate that PACAP(1-27) and PACAP(1-38) differ in terms of their requirement of the amino acids in positions 4, 5, 9, 11 and 13 for maximal interaction with the PAC1-receptor.',\n",

We affinity-isolated tenascin-C and isoforms of the proteoglycan-type protein tyrosine phosphatases zeta/beta (PTPzeta/RPTPbeta) from extracts of developing mouse brain. We showed that both PTPzeta/RPTPbeta and tenascin-C can bind directly to F3, possibly in an exclusive manner, with the highest affinity for the F3-PTPzeta/RPTPbeta interaction. We observed a strong binding of F3IgFc-coated fluorospheres to astrocytes in neural primary cultures and to C6 astrocytoma cells, and demonstrated, in antibody perturbation experiments, that F3-Ig binding on astrocytes depends on its interaction with PTPzeta/RPTPbeta. We also found by confocal analysis that tenascin-C and PTPzeta/RPTPbeta were colocalized on astrocytes which suggests a complex interplay of interactions between PTPzeta/RPTPbeta, tenascin-C and F3. We showed that the interaction between PTPzeta/RPTPbeta and F3-Ig-like domains can trigger bidirectional signalling. C6 glia-expressed PTPzeta/RPTPbeta stimulated neurite outgrowth by cortical and cerebellar neurons, whereas preclustered F3IgFc specifically modified the distribution of phosphotyrosine labelling in these glial cells. Both effects could be prevented and/or mimicked by anti-F3 and anti-6B4PG antibodies. These results identify F3 and PTPzeta/RPTPbeta as potential mediators of a reciprocal exchange of information between glia and neurons.',\n",

Both genes encode endothelial cell receptors for the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) ligand superfamily. Endoglin has homology to the type III receptor, betaglycan, although its exact role in TGF-beta signaling is unclear. Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1) has homology to the type I receptor family, but its ligand and corresponding type II receptor are unknown. In order to identify the ligand and type II receptor for ALK-1 and to investigate the role of endoglin in ALK-1 signaling, we devised a chimeric receptor signaling assay by exchanging the kinase domain of ALK-1 with either the TGF-beta type I receptor or the activin type IB receptor, both of which can activate an inducible PAI-1 promoter. We show that TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, as well as a third unknown ligand present in serum, can activate chimeric ALK-1. HHT-associated missense mutations in the ALK-1 extracellular domain abrogate signaling. The ALK-1/ligand interaction is mediated by the type II TGF-beta receptor for TGF-beta and most likely through the activin type II or type IIB receptors for the serum ligand. Endoglin is a bifunctional receptor partner since it can bind to ALK-1 as well as to type I TGF-beta receptor. These data suggest that HHT pathogenesis involves disruption of a complex network of positive and negative angiogenic factors, involving TGF-beta, a new unknown ligand, and their corresponding receptors.',\n",

Radioligand binding assays confirmed that the binding profiles of the recombinant receptors were similar to those of the native proteins. IL-8 displaced [125I]-IL-8 binding to CXCR1 and CXCR2 with pKi values of 8.89+/-0.05 and 9.27+/-0.03, respectively. GROalpha, a selective CXCR2 ligand, had a pKi value of 9.66+/-0.39 at CXCR2 but a pKi>8 at CXCR1. Calcium mobilization experiments were also consistent with previous reports on native receptors. Activation of both receptors resulted in stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. A comparison of the functional data at CXCRI showed that a similar potency order (IL-8> >GROalpha) was obtained in all three assays. However, at CXCR2 whilst the potency orders for calcium mobilization and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase were similar (IL-8 > or = GROalpha), the order was reversed for stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding (GROalpha > IL-8). All of the functional responses at both receptors were inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX), suggesting coupling to a Gi/Go protein. However, the calcium mobilization induced by IL-8 at CXCR1 was not fully inhibited by PTX, suggesting an interaction with a G-protein of the Gq family. Our results with pertussis toxin also suggested that, in the [35S]GTPgammaS binding assay, CXCR1 displays some constitutive activity. Thus, we have characterized the binding and several functional responses at HA-tagged CXCRs 1 and 2 and have shown that their pharmacology agrees well with that of the native receptors. We also have preliminary evidence that CXCR1 displays constitutive activity in our cell line and that CXCR2 may traffic between different PTX sensitive G-proteins.\",\n",

This study evaluated the effects of mammalian tachykinins and selective tachykinin agonists and antagonists on human monocytes isolated from healthy donors: SP, NKA and NKB all evoked a dose-dependent superoxide anion (O2-) production and the NK2 selective agonist [beta-Ala8]-NKA(4-10) induced a full response. The NK3 selective agonist senktide was inactive, while the NK1 selective agonists septide and [Sar9Met(O2)11]SP displayed some effects. These results indicate that NK2 and also some NK1 receptors are present in monocytes isolated from healthy donors. The role of tachykinin receptor activation in rheumatoid arthritis was also investigated, by measuring O2- production and TNF-alpha mRNA expression in monocytes isolated from rheumatoid patients. Tachykinins enhanced the expression of this cytokine in both control and rheumatoid monocytes and NK2 receptor stimulation was shown to trigger an enhanced respiratory burst in monocytes from rheumatoid patients.

One such KIR, denoted KIR2DL4, is structurally divergent from other KIRs in the configuration of its two extracellular Ig domains and of its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Here we show that recombinant soluble KIR2DL4 binds to cells expressing HLA-G but not to cells expressing other HLA class I molecules. Unlike other HLA class I-specific KIRs, which are clonally distributed on NK cells, KIR2DL4 is expressed at the surface of all NK cells. Furthermore, functional transfer of KIR2DL4 into the cell line NK-92 resulted in inhibition of lysis of target cells that express HLA-G, but not target cells that express other class I molecules including HLA-E.

In contrast, HLA-G tetramers did bind to peripheral blood monocytes, staining a CD16(+)CD14(mid) subset with greater intensity.

The 165-amino acid form of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) is a mitogen for endothelial cells and a potent angiogenic factor in vivo. Heparin binds to VEGF165 and enhances its binding to VEGF receptors. However, native HSPGs that bind VEGF165 and modulate its receptor binding have not been identified. Among the glypicans, glypican-1 is the only member that is expressed in the vascular system. We have therefore examined whether glypican-1 can interact with VEGF165. Glypican-1 from rat myoblasts binds specifically to VEGF165 but not to VEGF121. The binding has an apparent dissociation constant of 3 x 10(-10) M. The binding of glypican-1 to VEGF165 is mediated by the heparan sulfate chains of glypican-1, because heparinase treatment abolishes this interaction. Only an excess of heparin or heparan sulfates but not other types of glycosaminoglycans inhibited this interaction. VEGF165 interacts specifically not only with rat myoblast glypican-1 but also with human endothelial cell-derived glypican-1. The binding of 125I-VEGF165 to heparinase-treated human vascular endothelial cells is reduced following heparinase treatment, and addition of glypican-1 restores the binding. Glypican-1 also potentiates the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to a soluble extracellular domain of the VEGF receptor KDR/flk-1. Furthermore, we show that glypican-1 acts as an extracellular chaperone that can restore the receptor binding ability of VEGF165, which has been damaged by oxidation. Taken together, these results suggest that glypican-1 may play an important role in the control of angiogenesis by regulating the activity of VEGF165, a regulation that may be critical under conditions such as wound repair, in which oxidizing agents that can impair the activity of VEGF are produced, and in situations were the concentrations of active VEGF are limiting.',\n",

Experiments with the N-terminal domain of gelatinase A, the isolated C-terminal domain, or an inactive progelatinase A mutant showed that the hemopexin domain of gelatinase A makes an important contribution to the interaction with TIMP-3. The exchange of portions of the gelatinase A hemopexin domain with that of stromelysin revealed that residues 568-631 of gelatinase A were required for rapid association with TIMP-3. The N-terminal domain of gelatinase B alone also showed slower association with TIMP-3, again implying significant C-domain interactions. The isolation of complexes between TIMP-3 and progelatinases A and B on gelatin-agarose demonstrated that TIMP-3 binds to both proenzymes. We analyzed the effect of various polyanions on the inhibitory activity of TIMP-3 in our soluble assay. The association rate was increased by dextran sulfate, heparin, and heparan sulfate, but not by dermatan sulfate or hyaluronic acid.

This angiogenic activity was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against alphavbeta3, and an RAD mutant Del1 protein was inactive. Thus Del1 provides a unique autocrine angiogenic pathway for the embryonic endothelium, and this function is mediated in part by productive ligation of integrin alphavbeta3.',\n",
       " '10196234': 'Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a matricellular protein that displays both pro- and anti-adhesive activities. Binding to sulfated glycoconjugates mediates most high affinity binding of soluble TSP1 to MDA-MB-435 cells, but attachment and spreading of these cells on immobilized TSP1 is primarily beta1 integrin-dependent. The integrin alpha3beta1 is the major mediator of breast carcinoma cell adhesion and chemotaxis to TSP1. This integrin is partially active in MDA-MB-435 cells but is mostly inactive in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, which require beta1 integrin activation to induce spreading on TSP1. Integrin-mediated cell spreading on TSP1 is accompanied by extension of filopodia containing beta1 integrins. TSP1 binding activity of the alpha3beta1 integrin is not stimulated by CD47-binding peptides from TSP1 or by protein kinase C activation, which activate alphavbeta3 integrin function in the same cells. In MDA-MB-231 but not MDA-MB-435 cells, this integrin is activated by pertussis toxin, whereas serum, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and ligation of CD98 increase activity of this integrin in both cell lines. Serum stimulation is accompanied by increased surface expression of CD98, whereas insulin-like growth factor-1 does not increase CD98 expression. Thus, the pro-adhesive activity of TSP1 for breast carcinoma cells is controlled by several signals that regulate activity of the alpha3beta1 integrin.',\n",

We examined the effect of CMP on the adhesion of chondrocytes and fibroblasts using CMP-coated dishes. The CMP coating at 10-20 micrograms/ml enhanced the adhesion and spreading of rabbit growth plate, resting and articular chondrocytes, and fibroblasts and human epiphyseal chondrocytes and MRC5 fibroblasts. The effect of CMP on the spreading of chondrocytes was synergistically increased by native, but not heated, type II collagen (gelatin). The monoclonal antibody to integrin alpha1 or beta1 abolished CMP-induced cell adhesion and spreading, whereas the antibody to integrin alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, beta2, alpha5beta1, or alphaVbeta5 had little effect on cell adhesion or spreading. The antibody to integrin alpha1, but not to other subunits, coprecipitated 125I-CMP that was added to MRC5 cell lysates, indicating the association of CMP with the integrin alpha1 subunit. Unlabeled CMP competed for the binding to integrin alpha1 with 125I-CMP. These findings suggest that CMP is a potent adhesion factor for chondrocytes, particularly in the presence of type II collagen, and that integrin alpha1beta1 is involved in CMP-mediated cell adhesion and spreading. Since CMP is expressed almost exclusively in cartilage, this adhesion factor, unlike fibronectin or laminin, may play a special role in the development and remodeling of cartilage.',\n",

By expressing NP-1 in retinal neurons and NP-2 in DRG neurons, we demonstrate that neuropilins are sufficient to determine the functional specificity of semaphorin responsiveness.

However, human neutrophils do not migrate when the cells are stimulated with other human CC chemokines, such as human macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (hMIP-1 alpha) and eotaxin, which also use the CCR1 and CCR3 as their receptors. In this report, we demonstrate that while hMIP-1 alpha induced a negligible level of calcium flux and chemotaxis, Lkn-1 produced a high level of calcium flux and chemotaxis in human neutrophils. Lkn-1 cross-desensitized hMIP-1 alpha-induced calcium flux, but hMIP-1 alpha had little effect on the Lkn-1-induced response in human neutrophils. The same pattern was observed in peritoneal neutrophils from wild-type mice, whereas neutrophils from CCR1-/- mice failed to respond to either MIP-1 alpha or Lkn-1. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of receptor for both hMIP-1 alpha and Lkn-1 on human neutrophils with dissociation constants (Kd) of 3.2 nM and 1.1 nM, respectively. We conclude that CCR1 is a receptor mediating responses to both MIP-1 alpha and Lkn-1 on neutrophils and produces different biological responses depending on the ligand bound.',\n",

This cleavage occurs within the predicted transmembrane domain, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), and is reminiscent of gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), a critical event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A deficiency in presenilin-1 (PS1) inhibits processing of APP by gamma-secretase in mammalian cells, and genetic interactions between Notch and PS1 homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that the presenilins may modulate the Notch signalling pathway. Here we report that, in mammalian cells, PS1 deficiency also reduces the proteolytic release of NICD from a truncated Notch construct, thus identifying the specific biochemical step of the Notch signalling pathway that is affected by PS1. Moreover, several gamma-secretase inhibitors block this same step in Notch processing, indicating that related protease activities are responsible for cleavage within the predicted transmembrane domains of Notch and APP. Thus the targeting of gamma-secretase for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease may risk toxicity caused by reduced Notch signalling.\",\n",

Immunocytochemical analysis revealed localization of DG in multiple plaques on the basal side of resting cells. This patchy distribution was obscured in migrating cells, in which the most prominent staining was observed in the trailing edge anchoring the cells to the substratum. Biotin-labeled laminin-1 overlay assay of dissociated BAE membrane proteins indicated the interaction of laminin-1 with alphaDG. The laminin alpha5 globular domain fragment expressed in bacteria and labeled with biotin could also bind alphaDG on the membrane blot, and the unlabeled fragment disrupted the binding of biotin-laminin-1 to alphaDG. The interaction of biotin-laminin-1 with alphaDG was inhibited by soluble alphaDG contained in the conditioned medium from DG cDNA-transfected BAE cells and by a series of glycosaminoglycans (heparin, dextran sulfate, and fucoidan). Soluble alphaDG in the conditioned medium inhibited the adhesion of BAE cells to laminin-1-coated dishes, whereas it had no effect on their adhesion to fibronectin. All three glycosaminoglycans that disrupted the biotin-laminin-1 binding to alphaDG inhibited BAE cell adhesion to laminin-1, whereas they failed to inhibit the adhesion to fibronectin. These results indicate a role of DG as a non-integrin laminin receptor involved in vascular endothelial cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix.',\n",

We have found that the peptide sequence this integrin recognizes in tenascin-C is highly homologous to the sequence recognized by the closely related integrin alpha4beta1, in the inducible endothelial ligand, vascular cell adhesion mole-cule-1 (VCAM-1). We therefore sought to determine whether alpha9beta1 also recognizes VCAM-1, and whether any such interaction would be biologically significant. In this report, we demonstrate that alpha9beta1 mediates stable cell adhesion to recombinant VCAM-1 and to VCAM-1 induced on human umbilical vein endothelial cells by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, we show that alpha9beta1 is highly and selectively expressed on neutrophils and is critical for neutrophil migration on VCAM-1 and tenascin-C. Finally, alpha9beta1 and alpha4 integrins contribute to neutrophil chemotaxis across activated endothelial monolayers. These observations suggest a possible role for alpha9beta1/VCAM-1 interactions in extravasation of neutrophils at sites of acute inflammation.',\n",

Pleiotrophin has been demonstrated to bind to protein-tyrosine phosphatase zeta (PTPzeta) with high affinity. In this study, we examined the binding of midkine to PTPzeta by solid-phase binding assay. Midkine and pleiotrophin binding to PTPzeta were equally inhibited by soluble pleiotrophin and also by some specific glycosaminoglycans. For both bindings, Scatchard analysis revealed low (3.0 nM) and high (0.58 nM) affinity binding sites. These results suggested that PTPzeta is a common receptor for midkine and pleiotrophin. Midkine is structurally divided into the N- and C-terminal halves, and the latter exhibited full activity for PTPzeta binding and neuronal migration induction. The C-terminal half contains two heparin-binding sites consisting of clusters of basic amino acids, Clusters I and II. A mutation at Arg78 in Cluster I resulted in loss of the high affinity binding and reduced neuronal migration-inducing activity, while mutations at Lys83 and Lys84 in Cluster II showed almost no effect on either activity. Chondroitinase ABC-treated PTPzeta exhibited similar low affinity binding both to the native midkine and midkine mutants at Arg78. These results suggested that Arg78 in midkine plays an essential role in high affinity binding to PTPzeta by interacting with the chondroitin sulfate portion of this receptor.',\n",

To address this issue, the relative binding affinities of the egf domains of eleven ErbB ligands were measured on six ErbB receptor combinations using a soluble receptor-ligand binding format. The ErbB2/4 heterodimer was shown to bind all ligands tested with moderate to very high affinity. In contrast, ErbB3 showed much more restrictive ligand binding specificity and measurable binding was observed only with heregulin, neuregulin2beta, epiregulin and the synthetic heregulin/egf chimera, biregulin.

We found here that afadin directly interacted with a family of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which was isolated originally as the poliovirus receptor-related protein (PRR) family consisting of PRR1 and -2, and has been identified recently to be the alphaherpes virus receptor. PRR has a COOH-terminal consensus motif to which the PDZ domain of afadin binds. PRR and afadin were colocalized at cadherin-based cell-cell AJs in various tissues and cell lines. In E-cadherin-expressing EL cells, PRR was recruited to cadherin-based cell-cell AJs through interaction with afadin. PRR showed Ca2+-independent cell-cell adhesion activity. These results indicate that PRR is a cell-cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily which is recruited to cadherin-based cell-cell AJs through interaction with afadin.

Human and murine GPR-9-6 expression is very high in the thymus and low in lymph nodes and spleen. RT-PCR analysis of murine GPR-9-6 expression on murine FACS-sorted thymocyte subpopulations showed that this gene is expressed in both immature and mature T cells. Additions of human or murine TECK to HEK 293/human GPR-9-6 and HEK 293/murine GPR-9-6 transfectants provoked intracytoplasmic calcium mobilization. Human TECK also induced the in vitro migration of HEK 293/human GPR-9-6 cells. These results confirm that GPR-9-6 is a specific receptor for TECK.

The CXC chemokines IP-10 and Mig are selective attractants for activated (memory) T cells, the predominant cell type in skin infiltrates in many inflammatory dermatoses. The selectivity for activated T cells can be explained by the fact that both chemokines exert their effects through a common receptor, CXCR3, which is nearly exclusively expressed on activated T cells. The aim of this study was to identify biologically active CXCR3 ligands produced by keratinocytes. To that end, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a cDNA encoding CXCR3 were challenged with proteins obtained from interferon-gamma stimulated keratinocytes and subsequently monitored for effects on second messenger systems. By this approach we were able to isolate IP-10 and Mig, and in addition identified a novel highly potent ligand for the CXCR3 receptor, designated interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9, which proved to be chemotactic for activated T cells expressing CXCR3. Protein sequence and mass spectrometric analysis followed by molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9, revealed that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 is a CXC chemokine with a molecular mass of 8303 Da. From a GenBank database query it became clear that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 is in fact the protein encoded by the cDNA sequence also known as beta-R1, H174 or I-TAC. In situ hybridization experiments showed that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 mRNA is expressed by basal layer keratinocytes in a variety of skin disorders, including allergic contact dermatitis, lichen planus, and mycosis fungoides suggesting a functional role for this chemokine in skin immune responses.',\n",

Certain members of the CXC chemokine family can induce bovine capillary endothelial cell migration in vitro and corneal angiogenesis in vivo, and apparently act via binding to their receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. We used an RNAse protection assay that permitted the simultaneous detection of mRNA for various CXC chemokine receptors in resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and detected low levels of only CXCR4 mRNA. Stimulation of HUVECs with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) up-regulated levels of only CXCR4 mRNA. CXCR4 specifically binds the chemokine stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha). Competitive binding studies using 125I-labeled SDF-1alpha with Scatchard analysis indicated that VEGF or bFGF induced an average number of approximately 16,600 CXCR4 molecules per endothelial cell, with a Kd = 1.23 x 10(-9) mol/L. These receptors were functional as HUVECs and human aorta endothelial cells (HAECs) migrated toward SDF-1alpha. Although SDF-1alpha-induced chemotaxis was inhibited by the addition of a neutralizing monoclonal CXCR4 antibody, endothelial chemotaxis toward VEGF was not altered; therefore, the angiogenic effect of VEGF is independent of SDF-1alpha. Furthermore, subcutaneous SDF-1alpha injections into mice induced formation of local small blood vessels that was accompanied by leukocytic infiltrates. To test whether these effects were dependent on circulating leukocytes, we successfully obtained SDF-1alpha-induced neovascularization from cross sections of leukocyte-free rat aorta. Taken together, our data indicate that SDF-1alpha acts as a potent chemoattractant for endothelial cells of different origins bearing CXCR4 and is a participant in angiogenesis that is regulated at the receptor level by VEGF and bFGF.',\n",

The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region.

These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors. Our data suggest that TR6 inhibits the interactions of LIGHT with HVEM/TR2 and LTbetaR, thereby suppressing LIGHT- mediated HT29 cell death. Thus, TR6 may play a regulatory role for suppressing in FasL- and LIGHT-mediated cell death.',\n",

Although previous studies have shown that AGRP binds three of the five known subtypes of melanocortin receptor, the receptor domains participating in binding and the molecular interactions involved are presently unknown. The present studies were designed to examine the contribution of extracytoplasmic domains of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) to AGRP binding by making chimerical receptor constructs of the human melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R; a receptor that is not inhibited by AGRP) and the human MC4R (a receptor that is potently inhibited by AGRP). Substitutions of the extracytoplasmic NH2 terminus and the first extracytoplasmic loop (exoloop) of the MC4R with homologous domains of the MC1R had no effect on AGRP (87-132) binding affinity or inhibitory activity (the ability to inhibit melanocortin-stimulated cAMP generation). In contrast, cassette substitutions of exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC4R with the homologous exoloops of the MC1R resulted in a substantial loss of AGRP binding affinity and inhibitory activity. Conversely, the exchange of exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC1R with the homologous exoloops of the MC4R was found to confer AGRP binding and inhibitory activity to the basic structure of the MC1R. Importantly, these substitutions did not affect the ability of the alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone analogue [Nle4,D-Phe7] melanocyte stimulating hormone to bind or activate the chimeric receptors. These data indicate that exoloops 2 and 3 of the melanocortin receptors are important for AGRP binding.',\n",

Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.',\n",

In this study, we found that TAK-779, a nonpeptide compound with a small molecular weight (Mr 531.13), antagonized the binding of RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) to CCR5-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells and blocked CCR5-mediated Ca2+ signaling at nanomolar concentrations. The inhibition of beta-chemokine receptors by TAK-779 appeared to be specific to CCR5 because the compound antagonized CCR2b to a lesser extent but did not affect CCR1, CCR3, or CCR4.

The lipoprotein containing apo B-70. 5 (Lp B-70.5) was purified from apo B-100/apo B-70.5 heterozygotes by sequential ultracentrifugation combined with immunoaffinity chromatography. Cell culture experiments, ligand blot analysis, and in vivo studies all consistently showed that Lp B-70.5 is not recognized by the LDL receptor.

On ligand blotting of renal cortical membranes, Lp B-70.5 bound only to megalin. The ability of megalin to mediate cellular endocytosis of Lp B-70.5 was confirmed using retinoic acid/dibutyryl cAMP-treated F9 cells. This study suggests that the putative LDL receptor-binding site A on apo B-100 might not by itself be a functional binding domain and that the apo B-binding sites recognized by the LDL receptor and by megalin may be different. Moreover, megalin may play an important role in renal catabolism of apo B truncations, including apo B-70.5.',\n",

FGFR type 4 (FGFR4) in liver parenchymal cells binds only FGF-1, whereas FGFR1 binds FGF-1 and FGF-2 equally. Cell-free complexes of heparin and recombinant FGFR4 bound FGF-1 and FGF-2 equally. However, in contrast to FGFR1, when recombinant FGFR4 was expressed back in epithelial cells by transfection, it failed to bind FGF-2 unless heparan sulfate was depressed by chlorate or heparinase treatment. Isolated heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) from liver cells in cell-free complexes with FGFR4 restored the specificity for FGF-1 and supported the binding of both FGF-1 and FGF-2 when complexed with FGFR1. In contrast, FGF-2 bound equally well to complexes of both FGFR1 and FGFR4 formed with endothelial cell-derived HSPG, but the endothelial HSPG was deficient for the binding of FGF-1 to both FGFR complexes. These data suggest that a heparan sulfate subunit is a cell type- and FGFR-specific determinant of the selectivity of the FGFR signaling complex for FGF. In a physiological context, the heparan sulfate subunit may limit the redundancy among the current 18 FGF polypeptides for the 4 known FGFR.',\n",

The 25 kDa, non-glycosylated ifnar2-EC is a stable, fully active protein, which inhibits antiviral activity of IFNalpha2. The stoichiometry of binding IFNalpha2 is 1:1, as determined by gel filtration, chemical cross-linking and solid-phase detection. The affinity of this interaction is 10 nM, which is similar to the affinity measured for the cell surface-bound ifnar2 receptor. No difference in affinity was found throughout various assays using optical detection as BIAcore or reflectometric interference spectorscopy. However, the binding kinetics as measured in homogeneous phase by fluorescence de-quenching was about three times faster than that measured on a sensor surface. The rate of complex formation is relatively high compared to other cytokine-receptor interactions. The salt dependence of the association kinetics suggest a limited but significant contribution of electrostatic forces towards the rate of complex formation. The dissociation constant increases with decreasing pH according to the protonation of a base with a pKa of 6.7.

However, little direct evidence is available about which hormone subunits (alpha or beta) interact with which domains of the receptor. To determine whether the alpha-subunit contacts the exodomain of its receptor, hCG containing [125I]alpha and truncated exodomain lacking the endodomain were prepared. They were chemically cross-linked, and the resulting cross-linked complexes were solubilized and electrophoresed. The results indicate that the alpha-subunit of hCG was directly and specifically cross-linked to the exodomain. To verify the cross-linked exodomain by the independent method, the Flag epitope was inserted between the signal sequence and the mature exodomain. hCG containing [125I]alpha was cross-linked to the Flag exodomain, and the resulting cross-linked hCG/Flag exodomain complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. The results show that the material cross-linked to hCG containing [125I]alpha is indeed the exodomain. In conclusion, our results show the direct interaction of the alpha-subunit with the exodomain and, therefore, its crucial role in the hormone-receptor interaction in addition to its involvement in signal generation.',\n",

[125I]amylin binding was inhibited with IC50 of 3.1 +/- 0.5 nM and 4.0 +/- 0.8 nM human amylin in cells co-transfected with RAMP1 or -3, respectively, and hCT was 45 +/- 2- and 126 +/- 3-fold less potent. In conclusion, RAMP1 and -3 decrease calcitonin receptor expression in RAEC transfected with hCTR2 encoding cDNA and simultanously reveal an amylin receptor.',\n",
       " '10347172': 'Frizzled related proteins (FRPs) comprise a family of secreted molecules that contain an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) highly similar to the CRDs of the frizzled family of membrane-anchored Wnt receptors. FRPs have been shown to interact with Wnt proteins and antagonize Wnt signaling in a Xenopus developmental model. We demonstrated that FRP antagonizes the Wnt-induced increase in uncomplexed beta-catenin in both transient cotransfection and stable transformation models, where Wnt-induced morphological alterations are inhibited as well. We showed further that FRP inhibits Wnt signaling in a paracrine mode using a T-cell factor luciferase reporter to measure Wnt function. Investigation of the mechanisms responsible for FRP inhibition revealed that FRP forms complexes with WNT-1 or WNT-2 through its CRD domain. Transfection analysis with FRPs containing different tags revealed that FRP itself forms complexes and that this ability is conferred by its CRD domain. Finally, we demonstrated by cotransfection that FRP forms complexes with a prototype frizzled. All of these findings are consistent with a model by which FRP inhibits Wnt signaling through interactions with Wnt and/or formation of nonfunctional complexes with the frizzled receptor.',\n",
       " '10348342': 'The ErbB/HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases consists of four receptors that bind a large number of growth factor ligands sharing an epidermal growth factor- (EGF)-like motif. Whereas ErbB-1 binds seven different ligands whose prototype is EGF, the three families of neuregulins (NRGs) activate ErbB-3 and/or ErbB-4. Here we characterize a fourth neuregulin, NRG-4, that acts through ErbB-4. The predicted pro-NRG-4 is a transmembrane protein carrying a unique EGF-like motif and a short cytoplasmic domain. A synthetic peptide encompassing the full-length EGF-like domain can induce growth of interleukin-dependent cells ectopically expressing ErbB-4, but not cells expressing the other three ErbB proteins or their combinations. Consistent with specificity to ErbB-4, NRG-4 can displace an ErbB-4-bound NRG-1 and can activate signaling downstream of this receptor. Expression of NRG-4 mRNA was detected in the adult pancreas and weakly in muscle; other tissues displayed no detectable NRG-4 mRNA. The primary structure and the pattern of expression of NRG-4, together with the strict specificity of this growth factor to ErbB-4, suggest a physiological role distinct from that of the known ErbB ligands.',\n",

In resting cells the integrins are nonadhesive, but when activated they become adhesive for their ligands. Previous findings have shown that a peptide derived from the first Ig domain of ICAM-2 (P1) binds to LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) and Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and activates leukocyte aggregation. Because its mechanism of action has remained poorly understood, we have now studied the peptide-induced ligand binding in detail. Here we show that P1 was able to induce CD11/CD18-dependent adhesion of human T lymphocytes to immobilized, purified ICAM-1, -2, and -3. The optimal peptide concentration was 150 micrograms/ml, whereas concentrations higher than 400 micrograms/ml did not have any stimulatory effect. The increase in adhesion was detectable within 10 min of treatment with the peptide; it was dependent on energy, divalent cations, temperature, and an intact cytoskeleton but was unaffected by protein kinase C and protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Peptide treatment resulted in strong stimulation of the binding of soluble, recombinant ICAMs to T lymphocytes, showing that the integrin affinity toward its ligands was increased. Importantly, soluble ICAM-2Fc was also able to induce T lymphocyte adhesion to purified ICAM-1, -2, and -3, and it was a more potent stimulatory molecule than ICAM-1Fc or ICAM-3Fc.',\n",

The aim of this study was to identify structural requirements in both ligand and receptor that determine gamma-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) selectivity for the MC3R versus the MC4R. Substitution of Asp10 in [Nle4]Lys-gamma2-MSH for Gly10 from [Nle4]alpha-MSH, increased both activity and affinity for the MC4R while the MC3R remained unaffected. Analysis of chimeric MC3R/MC4Rs and mutant MC4Rs showed that Tyr268 of the MC4R mainly determined the low affinity for [Nle4]Lys-gamma2-MSH. The data demonstrate that Asp10 determines selectivity for the MC3R, however, not through direct side chain interactions, but probably by influencing how the melanocortin core sequence is presented to the receptor-binding pocket. This is supported by mutagenesis of Tyr268 to Ile in the MC4R which increased affinity and activity for [Nle4]Lys-gamma2-MSH, but decreased affinity for two peptides with constrained cyclic structure of the melanocortin core sequence, MT-II and [D-Tyr4]MT-II, that also displayed lower affinity for the MC3R. This study provides a general concept for peptide receptor selectivity, in which the major determinant for a selective receptor interaction is the conformational presentation of the core sequence in related peptides to the receptor-binding pocket.',\n",

The structure of the complex is unknown, and it is unclear whether there are one or two binding sites on G-CSF and the receptor. The immunoglobulin-like domain and the cytokine receptor homologous module of the receptor are involved in G-CSF binding, and Arg288 in the cytokine receptor homologous module is particularly important. To identify residues in G-CSF that interact with Arg288, selected charged residues in G-CSF were mutated to Ala. To clarify whether there are two binding sites, a chimeric receptor was created in which the Ig domain was replaced with that of the related receptor gp130. This chimera bound G-CSF but could not transduce a signal, consistent with failure of dimerization and loss of one binding site. The G-CSF mutants had reduced mitogenic activity on cells expressing wild-type receptor. When tested with the chimeric receptor, all G-CSF mutants except one (E46A) showed reduced binding, suggesting that Glu46 is important for interaction with the Ig domain. On cells expressing R288A receptor, all the G-CSF mutants except E19A showed reduced mitogenic activity, indicating that Glu19 of G-CSF interacts with Arg288 of the receptor.',\n",
       " '10364178': 'Chemokines play diverse roles in inflammatory and non-inflammatory situations via activation of heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptors. Also, many chemokine receptors can act as cofactors for cellular entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro. CCR5, a receptor for chemokines MIP-1alpha (LD78alpha), MIP-1beta, RANTES, and MCP2, is of particular importance in vivo as polymorphisms in this gene affect HIV infection and rate of progression to AIDS. Moreover, the CCR5 ligands can prevent HIV entry through this receptor and likely contribute to the control of HIV infection. Here we show that a non-allelic isoform of human MIP-1alpha (LD78alpha), termed LD78beta or MIP-1alphaP, has enhanced receptor binding affinities to CCR5 (approximately 6-fold) and the promiscuous beta-chemokine receptor, D6 (approximately 15-20-fold). We demonstrate that a proline residue at position 2 of MIP-1alphaP is responsible for this enhanced activity. Moreover, MIP-1alphaP is by far the most potent natural CCR5 agonist described to date, and importantly, displays markedly higher HIV1 suppressive activity than all other human MIP-1alpha isoforms examined. In addition, while RANTES has been described as the most potent inhibitor of CCR5-mediated HIV entry, MIP-1alphaP was as potent as, if not more potent than, RANTES in HIV-1 suppressive assays. This property suggests that MIP-1alphaP may be of importance in controlling viral spread in HIV-infected individuals.',\n",

Mouse expressed sequence tags containing two of these peptides were employed for oligonucleotide design and synthesis of probes by polymerase chain reaction and enabled us to isolate from a rat brain cDNA library a 4.1-kilobase clone that encoded two of our peptide sequences and represented the N-terminal portion of a protein containing a signal peptide and three leucine-rich repeats. Comparisons with recently published sequences also showed that our peptides were derived from proteins that are members of the Slit/MEGF protein family, which share a number of structural features such as N-terminal leucine-rich repeats and C-terminal epidermal growth factor-like motifs, and in Drosophila Slit is necessary for the development of midline glia and commissural axon pathways. All of the five known rat and human Slit proteins contain 1523-1534 amino acids, and our peptide sequences correspond best to those present in human Slit-1 and Slit-2. Binding of these ligands to the glypican-Fc fusion protein requires the presence of the heparan sulfate chains, but the interaction appears to be relatively specific for glypican-1 insofar as no other identified heparin-binding proteins were isolated using our affinity matrix. Northern analysis demonstrated the presence of two mRNA species of 8. 6 and 7.5 kilobase pairs using probes based on both N- and C-terminal sequences, and in situ hybridization histochemistry showed that these glypican-1 ligands are synthesized by neurons, such as hippocampal pyramidal cells and cerebellar granule cells, where we have previously also demonstrated glypican-1 mRNA and immunoreactivity. Our results therefore indicate that Slit family proteins are functional ligands of glypican-1 in nervous tissue and suggest that their interactions may be critical for certain stages of central nervous system histogenesis.',\n",

Two netrin genes, netrin-1 and netrin-2, have been described in chicken, but in mouse so far a single netrin gene, an ortholog of chick netrin-1, has been reported. We report the identification of a second mouse netrin gene, which we name netrin-3. Netrin-3 does not appear to be the ortholog of chick netrin-2 but is the ortholog of a recently identified human netrin gene termed NTN2L (\"netrin-2-like\"), as evidenced by a high degree of sequence conservation and by chromosomal localization. Netrin-3 is expressed in sensory ganglia, mesenchymal cells, and muscles during the time of peripheral nerve development but is largely excluded from the CNS at early stages of its development. The murine netrin-3 protein binds to netrin receptors of the DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) family [DCC and neogenin] and the UNC5 family (UNC5H1, UNC5H2 and UNC5H3). Unlike chick netrin-1, however, murine netrin-3 binds to DCC with lower affinity than to the other four receptors. Consistent with this finding, although murine netrin-3 can mimic the outgrowth-promoting activity of netrin-1 on commissural axons, it has lower specific activity than netrin-1. Thus, like netrin-1, netrin-3 may also function in axon guidance during development but may function predominantly in the development of the peripheral nervous system and may act primarily through netrin receptors other than DCC.',\n",

This function is dependent on the segregation of striatal projection neurons into anatomical and functional components, such as the striosome and matrix compartments. In the present study the association of ephrin-A cell surface ligands and EphA receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) with the organization of these compartments was determined in postnatal rats. Ephrin-A1 and ephrin-A4 selectively bind to EphA receptors on neurons restricted to the matrix compartment. Binding is absent from the striosomes, which were identified by mu-opioid receptor immunostaining. In contrast, ephrin-A2, ephrin-A3, and ephrin-A5 exhibit a different mosaic binding pattern that appears to define a subset of matrix neurons. In situ hybridization for EphA RTKs reveals that the two different ligand binding patterns strictly match the mRNA expression patterns of EphA4 and EphA7. Ligand-receptor binding assays indicate that ephrin-A1 and ephrin-A4 selectively bind EphA4 but not EphA7 in the lysates of striatal tissue. Conversely, ephrin-A2, ephrin-A3, and ephrin-A5 bind EphA7 but not EphA4. These observations implicate selective interactions between ephrin-A molecules and EphA RTKs as potential mechanisms for regulating the compartmental organization of the striatum.',\n",

The binding of galectin-1 to CD45 was detected by affinity chromatography of NP 40 solubilized Jurkat T cell membranes on galectin-1 agarose followed by immunoblotting of the galectin-1 agarose bound fraction applying monoclonal antibodies to CD45 isoforms. The PTPase activity of the galectin-1 agarose binding membrane fraction could be inhibited by sodium orthovanadate. Preincubation of Jurkat T cell membrane preparations with galectin-1 decreased the membrane-associated PTPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubation of Jurkat cells with galectin-1 suppressed the immunoprecipitated PTPase activity of CD45. Galectin-1 stimulates the cell surface expression of phosphatidylserine an early indicator of apoptosis. In CD45+ Jurkat T cells, galectin-1 induces higher levels of phosphatidylserine when compared with CD45- Jurkat cells.

In this study, we investigated the effects of a range of NC C-terminal truncated fragments and [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 on NC receptor binding, glutamate release from rat cerebrocortical slices (rCX), inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in CHO cells expressing the NC receptor (CHO(NCR)) and electrically evoked contractions of the rat vas deferens (rVD). In radioligand binding assays, a range of ligands inhibited [125I]-Tyr14-NC binding in membranes from rCX and CHO(NCR) cells. As the peptide was truncated there was a general decline in pKi. [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 was as potent as NC(1-13)NH2. The order of potency for NC fragments to inhibit cyclic AMP accumulation in whole CHO(NCR) cells was NCNH2> or =NC=NC(1-13)NH2>NC(1-12)NH2> >NC(1-11)NH2. [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 was a full agonist with a pEC50 value of 8.65.

In rVD NC inhibited electrically evoked contractions with a pEC50 of 6.63. Although [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2, displayed a small (instrinsic activity alpha = 0.19) but consistent residual agonist activity, it acted as a competitive antagonist (pA2 6.76) in the rVD. The differences between [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 action on central and peripheral NC signalling could be explained if [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 was a partial agonist with high strength of coupling in the CNS and low in the periphery. An alternative explanation could be the existence of central and peripheral receptor isoforms.',\n",

Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated a high-affinity binding of apoA-I and HDL to cubilin, and cubilin-expressing yolk sac cells showed efficient 125I-HDL endocytosis that could be inhibited by IgG antibodies against apoA-I and cubilin. The physiological relevance of the cubilin-apoA-I interaction was further emphasized by urinary apoA-I loss in some known cases of functional cubilin deficiency.

Recently it has been shown that L-selectin is involved not only in leukocyte tethering and rolling, but also plays an important role in leukocyte activation. For example, glycosylation-dependent cell-adhesion molecule 1 (GlyCAM-1), a known ligand for L-selectin, has been shown to enhance beta2-integrin function. GlyCAM-1 is a secreted protein and is present in mouse serum at a concentration of approx. 1.5 microg/ml. There is no obvious GlyCAM-1 homologue in man and, to date, L-selectin ligand(s) from human serum have not been characterized. Therefore we have used L-selectin affinity chromatography, followed by ion-exchange chromatography, to isolate specific ligand(s) for L-selectin. Using this procedure, we have isolated three major glycoproteins of apparent molecular masses 170 kDa, 70kDa and 50 kDa. The 170 kDa protein band was digested with trypsin and peptides were analysed by delayed extraction matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS and protein database searching. The 170 kDa protein was identified as the human complement protein Factor H. Human Factor H, isolated by a different method, was shown to bind specifically to L-selectin in the presence of CaCl2, and binding was inhibited by anti-L-selectin antibodies, fucoidan and lipopolysaccharide. Only a part of the purified Factor H preparation bound to immobilized L-selectin. The interaction of Factor H with leukocyte L-selectin was shown to induce the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Pretreatment of Factor H with sialidase reduced both the binding of L-selectin to Factor H and the Factor H-induced L-selectin-mediated TNF-alpha secretion by leukocytes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a post-translationally modified form of human plasma Factor H is a potential physiological ligand for L-selectin.',\n",

During midgestation embryogenesis, in situ hybridization analysis localized Fgf17 expression to specific sites in the midline structures of the forebrain, the midbrain-hindbrain junction, the developing skeleton and in developing arteries. Comparison to Fgf8 revealed a striking similarity in expression patterns, especially in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting that both genes may be important for CNS development, although Fgf17 is expressed somewhat later than Fgf8. In the developing skeleton, both genes are expressed in costal cartilage while Fgf8 is preferentially expressed in long bones.

In this study, integrin alpha2 was immunohistochemically demonstrated to be expressed on granulosa and large luteal cells. It was also detected on luteinizing theca interna cells after ovulation. Immunoreactive collagen type IV, which is one of the ligands for integrin alpha2beta1, was detected around granulosa cells in the pre-ovulatory follicles and its expression was rapidly increased during ovulation. By flow cytometry, collagen type IV was detected on the cell surface of luteinizing granulosa cells isolated from pre-ovulatory follicles, confirming the physiological interaction between granulosa cells and collagen type IV. Collagen type IV in follicular fluid was positively related with progesterone concentration. In 4-day cultures of granulosa cells, collagen type IV in the media was significantly increased by human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). The progesterone production was significantly attenuated when granulosa cells were cultured on collagen type IV-coated dishes, suggesting that collagen type IV suppresses granulosa cell luteinization. These findings show that collagen type IV, a ligand for integrin alpha2beta1, is rapidly produced around luteinizing granulosa cells during ovulation, probably under the control of luteinizing hormone (LH) and suggest that collagen type IV is a new parameter and/or regulator of granulosa cell luteinization in the periovulatory phases.',\n",

All fragments showed a varying degree of activity with the general order being SCR(1-3) = SCR(1-4) > SCR(1-2). Addition of SCR3 to SCR(1-2) significantly improved potency, whereas the addition of SCR4 conferred no additional benefit. This observation, coupled with the ability of the single-domain SCR3 to inhibit classical pathway mediated lysis with an IH50% (inhibition of hemolysis by 50%) of 4.8 microM, demonstrates that SCR3 provides key binding interactions with activated complement components. SCR(1-3) was able to inhibit both classical and alternative pathways of complement activation, showing that the N-terminal SCR of CR1 retain the ability to interact with C3b. Assays for CR1-like cofactor activity for factor I using C4b-like C4 or C3b-like C3 as substrates showed that SCR(1-3) possessed such cofactor activity and that C4b-like C4 was a better substrate.

In this study, we have examined the role of RAMPs in generating amylin receptor phenotypes from the calcitonin (CT) receptor gene product. Cotransfection of RAMP 1 or RAMP 3 with the human CT receptor lacking the 16-amino acid insert in intracellular domain 1 (hCTRI1-) into COS-7 cells induced specific 125I-labeled rat amylin binding. RAMP 2 or vector cotransfection did not cause significant increases in specific amylin binding. Competition-binding characterization of the RAMP-induced amylin receptors revealed two distinct phenotypes. The RAMP 1-derived amylin receptor demonstrated the highest affinity for salmon CT (IC50, 3.01 +/- 1.44 x 10(-10) M), a high to moderate affinity for rat amylin (IC50, 7.86 +/- 4.49 x 10(-9) M) and human CGRPalpha (IC50, 2.09 +/- 1.63 x 10(-8) M), and a low affinity for human CT (IC50, 4.47 +/- 0.78 x 10(-7) M).

Functional cyclic AMP responses in COS-7 cells cotransfected with individual RAMPs and hCTRI1- were reflective of the phenotypes seen in competition for amylin binding. Confocal microscopic localization of c-myc-tagged RAMP 1 indicated that, when transfected alone, RAMP 1 almost exclusively was located intracellularly. Cotransfection with calcitonin receptor (CTR)I1- induced cell surface expression of RAMP 1. The results of experiments cross-linking 125I-labeled amylin to RAMP 1/hCTR-transfected cells with bis succidimidyl suberate were suggestive of a cell-surface association of RAMP 1 and the receptors.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the in vivo effect of hFSH-beta-(33--53) on the mouse estrous cycle, extension of vaginal estrus, was not changed by substitution of Cys-51 with Ser. In contrast, mice receiving the Ser-substituted analog of hFSH-beta-(81--95) had normal estrus stages, but were arrested in diestrus. hFSH-beta-(33--53)-(81--95), a linear peptide encompassing both domains, also prolonged vaginal estrus. The Ser-substituted analog of this peptide, however, prolonged vaginal estrus in some of the mice tested and induced cycle arrest at diestrus in others. hFSH-beta-(90--95), the active subdomain at the C-terminus of hFSH-beta-(81--95), extended vaginal estrus, but diestrus stages were of normal duration. Its Ser-substituted analog, however, prolonged the estrus stage of the majority of mice treated, but induced diestrus arrest in some. The differing responses to these peptides are presumably due to interactions of the synthetic peptides with different regions of the FSH receptor. This further suggests that one consequence of ligand interaction with multiple receptor binding domains may be variable effects on ovarian function, and that Cys to Ser analogs may have value in the design of a novel class of synthetic peptides capable of fertility regulation and control.',\n",
       " '10395669': 'The human IFN-alpha receptor (hIFNAR) is a complex composed of at least two chains, hIFNAR1 and hIFNAR2. We have performed a structure-function analysis of hIFNAR2 extracellular domain regions using anti-hIFNAR2 mAbs (1D3, 1F3, and 3B7) and several type I human IFNs. These mAbs block receptor activation, as determined by IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 formation, and block the antiviral cytopathic effects induced by type I IFNs. We generated alanine substitution mutants of hIFNAR2-IgG and determined that regions of hIFNAR2 are important for the binding of these blocking mAbs and hIFN-alpha2/alpha1. We further demonstrated that residues E78, W101, I104, and D105 are crucial for the binding of hIFN-alpha2/alpha1 and form a defined protrusion when these residues are mapped upon a structural model of hIFNAR2. To confirm that residues important for ligand binding are indeed important for IFN signal transduction, we determined the ability of mouse L929 cells expressing hIFNAR2 extracellular domain mutants to mediate hIFN signal. hIFN-alpha8, previously shown to signal a response in L929 cells expressing hIFNAR1, was unable to signal in L929 cells expressing hIFNAR2. Transfected cells expressing hIFNAR2 containing mutations at residues E78, W101, I104, or D105 were unresponsive to hIFN-alpha2, but remained responsive to hIFN-beta. In summary, we have identified specific residues of hIFNAR2 important for the binding to hIFN-alpha2/1 and demonstrate that specific regions of the IFNAR interact with the subspecies of type I IFN in different manners.',\n",
       " '10397731': 'Integrin-associated protein (IAP; or CD47) is a receptor for the cell binding domain (CBD) of thrombospondin-1 (TS1). In platelets, IAP associates with and regulates the function of alphaIIbbeta3 integrin (Chung et al, J Biol Chem 272:14740, 1997). We test here the possibility that CD47 may also modulate the function of platelet integrin alpha2beta1, a collagen receptor. The CD47 agonist peptide, 4N1K (KRFYVVMWKK), derived from the CBD, synergizes with soluble collagen in aggregating platelet-rich plasma. 4N1K and intact TS1 also induce the aggregation of washed, unstirred platelets on immobilized collagen with a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. The effects of TS1 and 4N1K on platelet aggregation are absolutely dependent on IAP, as shown by the use of platelets from IAP-/- mice. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) prevents 4N1K-dependent aggregation on immobilized collagen but does not inhibit the 4N1K peptide stimulation of alpha2beta1-dependent platelet spreading. Finally, a detergent-stable, physical association of IAP and alpha2beta1 integrin is detected by coimmunoprecipitation. These results imply a role for IAP and TS1 in the early activation of platelets upon adhesion to collagen.',\n",

Interaction of EN-RAGEs with cellular RAGE on endothelium, mononuclear phagocytes, and lymphocytes triggers cellular activation, with generation of key proinflammatory mediators. Blockade of EN-RAGE/RAGE quenches delayed-type hypersensitivity and inflammatory colitis in murine models by arresting activation of central signaling pathways and expression of inflammatory gene mediators.

Netrin receptors of the Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) family are implicated in attraction and those of the UNC5 family in repulsion, but genetic evidence also suggests involvement of the DCC protein UNC-40 in some cases of repulsion. To test whether these proteins form a receptor complex for repulsion, we studied the attractive responses of Xenopus spinal axons to netrin-1, which are mediated by DCC. We show that attraction is converted to repulsion by expression of UNC5 proteins in these cells, that this repulsion requires DCC function, that the UNC5 cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to effect the conversion, and that repulsion can be initiated by netrin-1 binding to either UNC5 or DCC. The isolated cytoplasmic domains of DCC and UNC5 proteins interact directly, but this interaction is repressed in the context of the full-length proteins. We provide evidence that netrin-1 triggers the formation of a receptor complex of DCC and UNC5 proteins and simultaneously derepresses the interaction between their cytoplasmic domains, thereby converting DCC-mediated attraction to UNC5/DCC-mediated repulsion.',\n",

Here we report on the identification of Arg-336 and Asn-333 of CCK-AR, which interact with the Asp-8 carboxylate and the C-terminal amide of CCK-9, respectively. Identification of the two amino acids was achieved by dynamics-based docking of CCK in a refined three-dimensional model of CCK-AR using, as constraints, previous results that demonstrated that Trp-39/Gln-40 and Met-195/Arg-197 interact with the N terminus and the sulfated tyrosine of CCK, respectively.

The two splice isoforms, VEGF-B(167) and VEGF-B(186), have identical NH(2)-terminal cystine knot growth factor domains but differ in their COOH-terminal domains which give these forms their distinct biochemical properties. In this study, we show that both splice isoforms of VEGF-B bind specifically to Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a receptor for collapsins/semaphorins and for the VEGF(165) isoform. The NRP1 binding of VEGF-B could be competed by an excess of VEGF(165). The binding of VEGF-B(167) was mediated by the heparin binding domain, whereas the binding of VEGF-B(186) to NRP1 was regulated by exposure of a short COOH-terminal proline-rich peptide upon its proteolytic processing. In immunohistochemistry, NRP1 distribution was found to be overlapping or adjacent to known sites of VEGF-B expression in several tissues, in particular in the developing heart, suggesting the involvement of VEGF-B in NRP1-mediated signaling.',\n",

We report here that vMIP-I binds to and induces cytosolic [Ca(2+)] signals in human T cells selectively through CCR8, a CC chemokine receptor associated with Th2 lymphocytes. Furthermore, using a panel of 65 different human, viral, and rodent chemokines, we have established a comprehensive ligand binding \"fingerprint\" for CCR8. The receptor exhibits marked \"high\" affinity (K(d) < 15 nM) only for four chemokines, three of them of viral origin: vMIP-I, vMIP-II, vMCC-I, and human I-309. A previously unreported second class of lower affinity ligands includes MCP-3 and possibly two other viral chemokines. vMIP-I and I-309 appear to act as CCR8 agonists: binding to and inducing cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation through the receptor. By contrast, vMIP-II and vMCC-I act as potent antagonists: binding without inducing signaling, and blocking the effects of I-309 and vMIP-I. These results suggest a ligand hierarchy for CCR8, identifying vMIP-I as a selective viral chemokine agonist. CCR8 may thus engage a specific subset of chemokines with the potential to regulate each other during viral infection and immune regulation.',\n",

Three pieces of evidence indicate that the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an important component of this system. First, MCH stimulates feeding when injected directly into rat brains; second, the messenger RNA for the MCH precursor is upregulated in the hypothalamus of genetically obese mice and in fasted animals; and third, mice lacking MCH eat less and are lean. MCH antagonists might, therefore, provide a treatment for obesity. However, the development of such molecules has been hampered because the identity of the MCH receptor has been unknown until now. Here we show that the 353-amino-acid human orphan G-protein-coupled receptor SLC-1 expressed in HEK293 cells binds MCH with sub-nanomolar affinity, and is stimulated by MCH to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and reduce forskolin-elevated cyclic AMP levels.

MCH is a cyclic peptide that regulates a variety of functions in the mammalian brain, in particular feeding behaviour. We demonstrate that nanomolar concentrations of MCH strongly activate SLC-1-related pathways through G(alpha)i and/or G(alpha)q proteins.

In this study we examined the ability of HRG to regulate the binding of monomeric IgG and IC to monocytes. Initial studies demonstrated that HRG interacts with FcgammaRI on the monocytic cell line THP1 and blocks the binding of monomeric IgG to these cells. However, despite totally blocking the binding of monomeric IgG to FcgammaRI, pre-incubation of THP1 cells with HRG had no effect on the binding of IC to these cells. In contrast, depending on the HRG:IgG molar ratio, pre-incubation of monomeric IgG with HRG resulted in either enhanced or reduced IgG binding to FcgammaRI. Similarly, under certain highly defined conditions, incorporation of HRG in IgG-containing IC potentiated the binding of IC to THP1 cells. The key conditions involved incorporating approximately equimolar concentrations of HRG and IgG in the IC, the IC being formed at a near equivalence antigen:antibody ratio and usually physiological concentration (20 microM) of Zn(2+) being present. Collectively these observations indicate that HRG is an important regulator of IC uptake by monocytes. Thus HRG can interact with FcgammaRI on monocytes and block monomeric IgG binding, whereas when incorporated in IgG containing IC, HRG can enhance the uptake of IC by monocytes, probably via its heparan sulfate binding domain.',\n",

The cloned rat receptor had a similar pharmacology to that of the recently described mouse receptor and differs from that described for the human receptor.

A. (1998) Mol. Pharmacol. 54, 364-371). To characterize the functional group in CCK that interacts with His(207), we first substituted His(207) to Ala. This mutation decreased the affinity and the potency of CCK to produce total inositol phosphates 302-fold and 456-fold without affecting the expression of the mutant receptor. The screening of L-alanine-modified CCK peptides to bind and activate the wild type and mutant receptors allowed the identification of the interaction of the C-terminal Asp(8) of CCK with His(207). The H207A-CCKBR mutant, unlike the wild type receptor, was insensitive to substitution of Asp(8) of CCK to other amino acid residues. This interaction was further confirmed by mutating His(207) to Asp. The affinity of CCK for the H207D-CCKBR mutant was 100-fold lower than for the H207A-CCKBR mutant, consistent with an electrostatic repulsion between the negative charges of the two interacting aspartic acids. Peptides with neutral amino acids in position eight of CCK reversed this effect and displayed a gain of affinity for the H207D mutant compared with CCK.

The proteolytic activity of the M13 members, but not of Kell, has been previously demonstrated. A secreted form of wild-type Kell protein (s-Kell), devoid of the intracellular and transmembrane domains, was expressed in sf9 cells.

The most recently identified and fourth member of the beta 2 integrins, alpha D beta 2, selectively binds ICAM-3 and does not appear to bind ICAM-1. We have reported recently that alpha D beta 2 can support eosinophil adhesion to VCAM-1. Here we demonstrate that expression of alpha D beta 2 in a lymphoid cell that does not express alpha 4 integrins confers efficient binding to VCAM-1. In addition, a soluble form of alpha D beta 2 binds VCAM-1 with greater efficiency relative to ICAM-3. The I domain of alpha D contains a binding site for VCAM-1 since recombinant alpha D I domain binds specifically to VCAM-1. In addition, alpha D mAb that block cellular binding to VCAM-1 bind the alpha D I domain. Using VCAM-1 mutants we have determined that the binding site on VCAM-1 for alpha D beta 2 overlaps with that of alpha 4++ integrins. Substitution of VCAM-1 aspartate at position 40, D40, within the conserved integrin binding site, diminishes binding to alpha D beta 2 and abrogates binding to the alpha D I domain. The corresponding integrin binding site residue in ICAM-3 is also essential to alpha D beta 2 binding. Finally, we demonstrate that alpha D beta 2 can support lymphoid cell adhesion to VCAM-1 under flow conditions at levels equivalent to those mediated by alpha 4 beta 1. These results indicate that VCAM-1 can bind to an I domain and that the binding of alpha D beta 2 to VCAM-1 may contribute to the trafficking of a subpopulation of leukocytes that express alpha D beta 2.',\n",

In binding studies, PD 168368 had similar high affinities (K(i) = 15-45 nM) for NMB receptors from each species examined, 30- to 60-fold lower affinity for gastrin-releasing peptide receptors, and >300-fold lower affinity for Bn receptor subtype 3 or 4. It inhibited NMB binding in a competitive manner. PD 168368 alone did not stimulate increases in either intracellular calcium concentration or [(3)H]inositol phosphates in any of the cells studied but inhibited NMB-induced responses with equivalent potencies in cells containing NMB receptors. PD 168368 was only minimally soluble in water. When hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin rather than dimethyl sulfoxide was used as the vehicle, both the affinity and the antagonist potency of PD 168368 were significantly greater. The results demonstrate that PD 168368 is a potent, competitive, and selective antagonist at NMB receptors, with a similar pharmacology across animal species. PD 168368 should prove useful for delineating the biological role of NMB and selectively blocking NMB signaling in bioassays and as a lead for the development of more selective nonpeptide antagonists for the NMB receptor.',\n",

Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded pituitary sections while ultrastructural immunocytology was done on frozen and Lowicryl-resin-embedded ultrathin sections. GHRH-R-like immunoreactivity was restricted to somatotropes and colocalized with GH in both rat and human tissues. No signal was detected in gonadotropes, lactotropes, corticotropes and thyrotropes.

In the nucleus, gold particles were mainly observed at the junction between eu- and heterochromatin. The highest density of labeling was observed in the cytoplasm (55 vs. 45% in the nucleus), mainly in secretory granules (59% of cytoplasmic labeling) and the plasma membrane.

The predicted mature protein of 1166 amino acids contains seven conserved FG-GAP repeats, an I domain with a metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif, a short transmembrane region, and a unique cytoplasmic domain of 24 amino acids containing the sequence GFFRS. alpha(11), like other I domain integrins, lacks a dibasic cleavage site for generation of a heavy chain and a light chain, and it contains three potential divalent cation binding sites in repeats 5-7. The presence of 22 inserted amino acids in the extracellular stalk portion (amino acids 804-826) distinguishes the alpha(11) integrin sequence from other integrin alpha-chains. Amino acid sequence comparisons reveal the highest identity of 42% with the alpha(10) integrin chain. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to alpha(11) integrin captures a 145-kDa protein distinctly larger than the 140-kDa alpha(2) integrin chain when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions.

The ligand peptide identified for hGR3 was found to show a specific prolactin release promoting activity in rat anterior pituitary cells in in vitro culture and was therefore named \"prolactin-releasing peptide.\" We named another novel bioactive peptide \"apelin,\" for \"APJ endogenous ligand.\" Although the biological functions of apelin are still under investigation, APJ reportedly acts as a coreceptor in the process of human immunodeficiency virus infection. We believe that the identification of orphan 7TMR ligands will provide clues to reveal the unknown regulatory mechanisms of various physiological phenomena and opportunities for novel drug discovery in the future.',\n",
       " '10477718': 'CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.',\n",

We describe the identification and characterization of a large neuronal IL-16 precursor, NIL-16. The N-terminal half of NIL-16 constitutes a novel PDZ domain protein sequence, whereas the C terminus is identical with splenocyte-derived mouse pro-IL-16. IL-16 has been characterized only in the immune system, and the identification of NIL-16 marks a previously unsuspected connection between the immune and the nervous systems. NIL-16 is a cytosolic protein that is detected only in neurons of the cerebellum and the hippocampus. The N-terminal portion of NIL-16 interacts selectively with a variety of neuronal ion channels, which is similar to the function of many other PDZ domain proteins that serve as intracellular scaffolding proteins. Among the NIL-16-interacting proteins is the class C alpha1 subunit of a mouse brain calcium channel (mbC alpha1). The C terminus of NIL-16 can be processed by caspase-3, resulting in the release of secreted IL-16. Furthermore, in cultured cerebellar granule neurons undergoing apoptosis, NIL-16 proteolysis parallels caspase-3 activation. Cerebellar granule neurons express the IL-16 receptor CD4. Exposure of these cells to IL-16 induces expression of the immediate-early gene, c-fos, via a signaling pathway that involves tyrosine phosphorylation. This suggests that IL-16 provides an autocrine function in the brain. Therefore, we hypothesize that NIL-16 is a dual function protein in the nervous system that serves as a secreted signaling molecule as well as a scaffolding protein.',\n",

Activated alveolar macrophages obtained from rat lungs after bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury released increased amounts of active TGF-beta1 as well as plasmin, a protease, and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a trimeric glycoprotein. Previously we had demonstrated that plasmin was critical to the activation of L-TGF- beta1. In the present study we demonstrated that TSP-1 is also important for the activation of L-TGF- beta1 because the activation can be inhibited by anti-TSP-1 monoclonal antibody. Proteins obtained from alveolar macrophage cell lysates immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for TSP-1 were identified on immunoblots as LAP and TGF-beta1, indicating that TSP-1/L-TGF-beta1 complexes are present on alveolar macrophages. However, in the presence of plasmin both latency-associated peptide and TGF-beta1 were decreased in the same cell lysates, indicating that L-TGF-beta1 associated with TSP-1 is released by plasmin. Using immunofluorescence and antibodies to TGF-beta1 and CD36, a receptor for TSP-1, there was colocalization of TGF-beta1 with CD36. Because TSP-1 but not TGF-beta1 is a natural ligand for CD36, these findings suggest that the L-TGF-beta1 in a complex with TSP-1 localizes to the macrophage cell surface when TSP-1 interacts with its receptor, CD36. Furthermore, the association of TSP-1/L-TGF-beta1 complex with CD36 is necessary to the activation of L-TGF-beta1 because antibodies to CD36 prevent the colocalization of TGF-beta1 with CD36 as observed by immunofluorescence and inhibit activation of the L-TGF-beta1 by explanted alveolar macrophages. These findings suggest that activation of L-TGF-beta1 by plasmin occurs at the cell surface of activated alveolar macrophages and requires a TSP-1/CD36 interaction.',\n",

R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.',\n",

These events are mediated by NGF as a result of binding to its two cell-surface receptors, TrkA and p75. TrkA is a receptor with tyrosine kinase activity that forms a high-affinity binding site for NGF. Of the five domains comprising its extracellular portion, the immunoglobulin-like domain proximal to the membrane (TrkA-d5 domain) is necessary and sufficient for NGF binding. Here we present the crystal structure of human NGF in complex with human TrkA-d5 at 2.2 A resolution. The ligand-receptor interface consists of two patches of similar size. One patch involves the central beta-sheet that forms the core of the homodimeric NGF molecule and the loops at the carboxy-terminal pole of TrkA-d5. The second patch comprises the amino-terminal residues of NGF, which adopt a helical conformation upon complex formation, packing against the 'ABED' sheet of TrkA-d5. The structure is consistent with results from mutagenesis experiments for all neurotrophins, and indicates that the first patch may constitute a conserved binding motif for all family members, whereas the second patch is specific for the interaction between NGF and TrkA.\",\n",

We report here that [D-Tyr4]melanotan-II and RMI-2001 (Ac-cyclo-[Cys4, Gly5, D-Phe7, Cys10]alpha-MSH-NH2) have significantly higher affinity and potency on the rat melanocortin MC4 receptor as compared to the rat melanocortin MC3 receptor. Nle-gamma-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) was the only ligand with higher affinity and potency on the rat melanocortin MC3 receptor. The potency order of melanocortin MC4 receptor agonists, but not that of melanocortin MC3 receptor agonists, fitted with the potency of these ligands to stimulate grooming behavior, when administered intracerebroventricularly. SHU9119 (Ac-cyclo-[Nle4, Asp5, D-Nal(2)7, Lys10]alpha-MSH-(4-10)-NH2) and RMI-2005 (Ac-cyclo-[Cys4, Gly5, D-Na](2)7, Nal(2)9, Cys10]alpha-MSH-(4-10)-NH2) were able to inhibit alpha-MSH-induced melanocortin receptor activity in vitro, as well as alpha-MSH-induced grooming behavior. Melanotan-II, [Nle4-D-Phe7]alpha-MSH and RMI-2001 were also effective in inducing grooming behavior when administered intravenously. In the absence of purely selective melanocortin MC(3/4) receptor ligands, we demonstrated that careful comparison of ligand potencies in vitro with ligand potencies in vivo, could identify which melanocortin receptor subtype mediated alpha-MSH-induced grooming behavior. Furthermore, blockade of novelty-induced grooming behavior by SHU9119 demonstrated that this physiological stress response is mediated via activation of the melanocortin system.',\n",

C. Monboisse et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269: 25475-25482, 1994; J. Han et al., J. Biol. Chem., 272: 20395-20401, 1997). More recently, we demonstrated that native COL IV and -SNS-containing synthetic peptides (10 microg/ml) added to culture medium inhibit the proliferation of not only melanoma cells but also breast, pancreas, and stomach tumor cells up to 82% and prostate tumor cells by 15%. This inhibition was shown to be dependent on a COL IV- or peptide-induced increase in intracellular cAMP (T. A. Shahan et al., Connect. Tissue Res., 40: 221-232, 1999). Attempts to identify the putative receptor(s) on tumor cells led to the isolation of five proteins (Mr 33,000, 52,000, 72,000, 95,000, and 250,000) from melanoma and prostate cells by affinity purification with the alpha3(IV)179-208 peptide. The Mr 52,000, 95,000, and 250,000 proteins were shown to be CD47/integrin-associated protein(IAP), the integrin beta3 subunit, and the alpha(v)beta3 integrin complex, respectively. The Mr 33,000 and 72,000 proteins have not yet been identified. To confirm the specificity of ligand binding to the receptors, cell membranes from either melanoma or prostate tumor cells were pretreated with the unlabeled ligand alpha3(IV)187-191 (-YYSNS-); alternatively, the peptide was pretreated with a peptide-reactive monoclonal antibody (A5D7) before receptor isolation. These treatments inhibited the purification of CD47/IAP, the integrin beta3 subunit, and the alpha(v)beta3 integrin complex from tumor cells. Furthermore, cells treated with CD47/IAP- or the alpha(v)beta3 integrin-reactive antibodies prevented the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide from inhibiting cell proliferation and the subsequent rise in intracellular cAMP. Pretreating cells with the alpha3(IV)187-191 (-YYSNS-) peptide also inhibited their adhesion to the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide substrate, whereas the inactive alpha1(IV)185-203 peptide, from the same region of the alpha1 chain as the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide, had no effect. Incubation of cells with either CD47/IAP and/or alpha(v)beta3 integrin-reactive antibodies inhibited their adhesion to the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide, whereas antibodies to the beta1 and beta2 integrin subunits were without effect. These data suggest that ALC-COL IV, through its alpha3(IV) chain, inhibits tumor cell proliferation using the receptors CD47/IAP and the alpha(v)beta3 integrin.',\n",
       " '10493819': 'Binding of lutropin/choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) to its cognate receptor results in the activation of adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C. This divergent signaling of the LH receptor is based on the independent activation of distinct G protein subfamilies, i.e. , Gs, Gi, and potentially also Gq. To examine the selectivity of LH receptor coupling to phospholipase C beta-activating G proteins, we used an in vivo reconstitution system based on the coexpression of the LH receptor and different G proteins in baculovirus-infected insect cells. In this paper, we describe a refined expression strategy for the LH receptor in insect cells. The receptor protein was inserted into the cell membrane at an expression level of 0.8 pmol/mg of membrane protein. Sf9 cells expressing the LH receptor responded to hCG challenge with a concentration-dependent accumulation of intracellular cAMP (EC50 = 630 nM) but not of inositol phosphates, whereas stimulation of the histamine H1 receptor in Sf9 cells led to increased phospholipase C (PLC) activity. Immunoblotting experiments using G protein-specific antisera revealed the absence of quantitative amounts of alpha i in Sf9 cells, whereas alpha s and alpha q/11 were detected. We therefore attempted to restore the hCG-dependent PLC activation by infection of Sf9 cells with viruses encoding the LH receptor and different G protein alpha subunits. HCG stimulation of cells coexpressing the LH receptor and exogenous alpha i2 resulted in stimulation of PLC activity. In cells coinfected with an alpha i3-baculovirus, hCG challenge led to a minor activation of PLC, whereas no hCG-dependent PLC stimulation was observed in cells coexpressing alpha i1. Most notably, coinfection with baculoviruses encoding alpha q or alpha 11 did not reproduce the PLC activation by the LH receptor. Thus, the murine LH receptor activates adenylyl cyclase via Gs and PLC via selective coupling to Gi2.',\n",

The molecular cloning of TPO has allowed a detailed characterisation of its precise biological activities, both in vitro and in vivo. TPO binds its specific receptor, the c-Mpl protein, which is expressed on the surface of target cells, and induces receptor dimerization and activation of intracellular signalling pathways including the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and Ras cascades. TPO is a lineage-dominant cytokine, stimulating megakaryocyte production and maturation in vitro and inducing the greatest elevation in platelet numbers of any known cytokine upon administration to humans or laboratory animals. Indeed, gene targeting studies have established that the TPO/c-Mpl signalling system is the major physiological regulator of steady-state megakaryocyte and platelet production. These studies have also revealed a largely unanticipated role for TPO in the regulation of hemopoietic stem cells. Preclinical studies in animal models have indicated the capacity of c-Mpl ligands to overcome the thrombocytopenia associated with chemo/radiotherapy and clinical trials have already demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Mpl-ligands in elevating platelet counts in humans. It is likely that these molecules will lead to new therapeutics that will find utility in a range of clinical contexts.',\n",

KIRs and T cell receptors (TCRs) bind in a peptide-dependent manner to overlapping regions of peptide-MHC class I complexes. KIRs with two immunoglobulin domains (KIR2Ds) recognize distinct subsets of HLA-C alleles. Here we use surface plasmon resonance to study the binding of soluble forms of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL3 to several peptide-HLA-Cw7 complexes. KIR2DL3 bound to the HLA-Cw7 allele presenting the peptide RYRPGTVAL with a 1:1 stoichiometry and an affinity (K(d) approximately 7 microM at 25 degrees C) within the range of values measured for other cell-cell recognition molecules, including the TCR. Although KIR2DL1 is reported not to recognize the HLA-Cw7 allele in functional assays, it bound RYRPGTVAL/HLA-Cw7, albeit with a 10-20-fold lower affinity. TCR/peptide-MHC interactions are characterized by comparatively slow kinetics and unfavorable entropic changes (Willcox, B. E., Gao, G. F., Wyer, J. R. , Ladbury, J. E., Bell, J. I., Jakobsen, B.

In contrast, we show that KIR2DL3 binds RYRPGTVAL/HLA-Cw7 with fast kinetics and a favorable binding entropy, consistent with rigid body association. These results indicate that KIR/peptide-MHC class I interactions have properties typical of other cell-cell recognition molecules, and they highlight the unusual nature of TCR/peptide-MHC recognition.',\n",

Orexin-A and orexin-B increased [Ca2+]i in a concentration dependent manner in CHO-OX1 (pEC50=8.03+/-0.08 and 7. 30+/-0.08 respectively, n=5) and CHO-OX2 (pEC50=8.18+/-0.10 and 8. 43+/-0.09 respectively, n=5) cells.

In calcium-free conditions the peak response was unaffected but the secondary phase was shortened, returning to basal values within 90 s. Calcium (1.5 mM) replacement restored the secondary phase.

BMP-6 strongly induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in cells of osteoblast lineage, including C2C12 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells, and ROB-C26 cells. The profile of binding of BMP-6 to type I and type II receptors was similar to that of OP-1/BMP-7 in C2C12 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells; BMP-6 strongly bound to activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-2 (also termed ActR-I), together with type II receptors, i.e. BMP type II receptor (BMPR-II) and activin type II receptor (ActR-II). In addition, BMP-6 weakly bound to BMPR-IA (ALK-3), to which BMP-2 also bound.

IL-11 acts on cells expressing gp130 and the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) alpha-subunit (IL-11Ralpha). The structural epitopes of IL-11 required for the recruitment of the individual receptor subunits have not yet been defined. Based on the structure of CNTF, a three-dimensional model of human IL-11 was built. Using this model, 10 surface exposed amino acid residues of IL-11 were selected for mutagenesis using analogies to the well-characterized receptor recruitment sites of IL-6, CNTF, and LIF. The respective mutants of human IL-11 were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in bacteria. Their biological activities were determined on HepG2 and Ba/F3-130-11alpha cells. Several mutants with substantially decreased bioactivity and one hyperagonistic mutant were identified and further analyzed with regard to recruitment of IL-11Ralpha and gp130. The low-activity mutant I171D still binds IL-11Ralpha but fails to recruit gp130, whereas the hyperagonistic variant R135E more efficiently engages the IL-11R subunits. The low-activity mutants R190E and L194D failed to bind to IL-11Ralpha.

We also present evidence supporting a two-step mechanism of collagenase-3 binding and internalization involving both a specific collagenase-3 receptor and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Ligand blot analysis shows that (125)I-collagenase-3 binds specifically to two proteins ( approximately 170 kDa and approximately 600 kDa) present in UMR 106-01 cells. Western blotting identified the 600-kDa protein as the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Our data suggest that the 170-kDa protein is a specific collagenase-3 receptor. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-null mouse embryo fibroblasts bind but fail to internalize collagenase-3, whereas UMR 106-01 and wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts bind and internalize collagenase-3. Internalization, but not binding, is inhibited by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein. We conclude that the internalization of collagenase-3 requires the participation of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and propose a model in which the cell surface interaction of this ligand requires a sequential contribution from two receptors, with the collagenase-3 receptor acting as a high affinity primary binding site and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein mediating internalization.',\n",

In this study, we have examined if there are other additional ephrin ligands interacting with the EphA8 receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. For this purpose, we have constructed chimeric ephrin-A1, -A4, -B1, -B2 or -B3 ligands consisting of the Fc portion of human IgG fused to their carboxyl-terminus. Both ephrin-A1 and ephrin-A4 chimeric ligands efficiently bound to the EphA8 receptor expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, whereas the transmembrane ligands including ephrin-B1, -B2 and -B3 did not. Additionally we have demonstrated that both the EphA8-TrkB chimeric receptor and the EphA8 receptor expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts are efficiently tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulating with epthin-A1 or -A4 but none of transmembrane ephrin-B proteins.

In addition, ligands that interact with EphA5 are expressed in distinct hippocampal regions during development of the entorhino-hippocampal projection. Of these ligands, ephrin-A3 mRNA is localized both in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus and in the pyramidal cell layer of the cornu ammonis, whereas ephrin-A5 mRNA is only expressed in the pyramidal cell layer of the cornu ammonis. In the dentate gyrus, the ligand protein is not present in the termination zone of the entorhinal efferents (the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus) but is concentrated in the inner molecular layer into which entorhinal efferents do not grow. We used outgrowth and stripe assays to test the effects of ephrin-A3 and ephrin-A5 on the outgrowth behavior of entorhinal axons. This functional analysis revealed that entorhinal neurites were repelled by ephrin-A3 but not by ephrin-A5. These observations suggest that ephrin-A3 plays an important role in the layer-specific termination of the perforant pathway and that this ligand may interact with the EphA5 receptor to restrict entorhinal axon terminals in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus.',\n",

Because alpha6beta1 is present on murine eggs and interacts with the sperm-surface glycoprotein ADAM 2 (fertilin beta), we first asked whether CD9 is present on murine eggs and whether it functions in sperm-egg binding and fusion. CD9 is present on the plasma membrane of oocytes in the ovary as well as on eggs isolated from the oviduct. The anti-CD9 mAb, JF9, potently inhibits sperm-egg binding and fusion in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. JF9 also disrupts binding of fluorescent beads coated with native fertilin or a recombinant fertilin beta disintegrin domain. (Both ligands bind to the egg via alpha6beta1.) Immunohistochemistry showed that CD9 is undetectable in the uterine epithelium, appears basolaterally and as prominent apical patches on the epithelium in the region between the uterus and the oviduct, and then persists apically in the oviduct. The integrin alpha6A subunit is found in similar apical patches in the region between the uterus and oviduct, but is confined to the basal aspect of the epithelium in the uterus and oviduct. Hence, alpha6A and CD9 both are expressed on the apical epithelial surface at the uterine-oviduct junction. These findings correlate with the observation that fertilin beta \"knockout\" sperm traverse the uterus but do not progress into the oviduct, contributing to the infertility of fertilin beta(-/-) male mice. Our results suggest that high-avidity binding between fertilin beta (ADAM 2) and alpha6beta1 requires cooperation between alpha6beta1 and CD9. Such cooperation may assist sperm passage into the oviduct as well as sperm-egg interactions.',\n",

We find that the two known semaphorin-binding proteins, plexin 1 (Plex 1) and neuropilin-1 (NP-1), form a stable complex. Plex 1 alone does not bind semaphorin-3A (Sema3A), but the NP-1/Plex 1 complex has a higher affinity for Sema3A than does NP-1 alone. While Sema3A binding to NP-1 does not alter nonneuronal cell morphology, Sema3A interaction with NP-1/Plex 1 complexes induces adherent cells to round up. Expression of a dominant-negative Plex 1 in sensory neurons blocks Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. Sema3A treatment leads to the redistribution of growth cone NP-1 and plexin into clusters. Thus, physiologic Sema3A receptors consist of NP-1/plexin complexes.',\n",

Plexin-B1 is a receptor for the transmembrane semaphorin Sema4D (CD100), and plexin-C1 is a receptor for the GPI-anchored semaphorin Sema7A (Sema-K1). Secreted (class 3) semaphorins do not bind directly to plexins, but rather plexins associate with neuropilins, coreceptors for these semaphorins. Plexins are widely expressed: in neurons, the expression of a truncated plexin-A1 protein blocks axon repulsion by Sema3A. The cytoplasmic domain of plexins associates with a tyrosine kinase activity. Plexins may also act as ligands mediating repulsion in epithelial cells in vitro. We conclude that plexins are receptors for multiple (and perhaps all) classes of semaphorins, either alone or in combination with neuropilins, and trigger a novel signal transduction pathway controlling cell repulsion.',\n",

Human beta-defensin was selectively chemotactic for cells stably transfected to express human CCR6, a chemokine receptor preferentially expressed by immature dendritic cells and memory T cells. The beta-defensin-induced chemotaxis was sensitive to pertussis toxin and inhibited by antibodies to CCR6. The binding of iodinated LARC, the chemokine ligand for CCR6, to CCR6-transfected cells was competitively displaced by beta-defensin.

If the CR1-C1q interaction were to participate in immune complex clearance, then this interaction should support E adhesion. Using a tip plate adhesion assay, we found that immobilized C1q mediated adhesion of human E. E binding to C1q was specifically inhibited by polyclonal anti-CR1 Fab fragments. Intact C1 was not efficient as an adherence ligand until it was treated with EDTA or the C1 inhibitor to remove the C1r2C1s2 complex from C1, leaving C1q. Titration of C1q alone, C4b alone, and C1q + C4b indicated that the two complement ligands were additive in their ability to support CR1-mediated adhesion of E. Analysis of binding to immobilized CR1 using a BIAcore instrument documented that C1q, C4b, and C3b binding were independent events. Additionally, C1q-dependent binding of immune complexes and heat-aggregated IgG to E was documented. These experiments confirm that the immune adherence receptor in humans, CR1, is the single receptor for all of the opsonic ligands of complement, provide evidence for a single C1q binding site on LHR-D of CR1, and suggest that C1q may participate in immune clearance.',\n",
       " '10529171': 'The CC chemokine, MCP-1, has been identified as a major chemoattractant for T cells and monocytes, and plays a significant role in the pathology of inflammatory diseases. To identify the regions of MCP-1 that contact its receptor, CCR2, we substituted all surface-exposed residues with alanine. Some residues were also mutated to other amino acids to identify the importance of charge, hydrophobicity, or aromaticity at specific positions. The binding affinity of each mutant for CCR2 was assayed with THP-1 and CCR2-transfected CHL cells. The majority of point mutations had no effect. Residues at the N-terminus of the protein, known to be crucial for signaling, contribute less than a factor of 10 to the binding affinity. However, two clusters of primarily basic residues (R24, K35, K38, K49, and Y13), separated by a 35 A hydrophobic groove, reduced the level of binding by 15-100-fold. A peptide fragment encompassing residues 13-35 recapitulated some of the mutational data derived from the intact protein. It exhibited modest binding as a linear peptide and dramatically improved affinity when the region which adopts a single turn of a 3(10)-helix in the protein, which includes R24, was constrained by a disulfide bond. Additional constraints at the ends of the peptide, corresponding to the disulfide between the first and third cysteines in MCP-1, yielded further improvements in affinity. Together, these data suggest a model in which a large surface area of MCP-1 contacts the receptor, and the accumulation of a number of weak interactions results in the 35 pM affinity observed for the wild-type (WT) protein. The receptor binding site of MCP-1 also is significantly different from the binding sites of RANTES and IL-8, providing insight into the issue of receptor specificity. It was previously shown that the N-terminus of CCR2 is critical for binding MCP-1 [Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19084-92; Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 23186-90]. Point mutations of six acidic residues in this region of the receptor were made to test their role in ligand binding. This identified D25 and D27 of the DYDY motif as being important. On the basis of our data, we propose a model in which the receptor N-terminus lies along the hydrophobic groove in an extended fashion, placing the DYDY motif near the basic cluster involving R24 and K49 of MCP-1. This in turn orients the signaling residues (Y13 and the N-terminus) for productive interaction with the receptor.',\n",

Here, we show that both the EphA5 receptor and its ephrin-A ligands (2 and 5) are expressed in the adult mouse hippocampus, and the EphA5 protein is present in a phosphorylated form. Because there are no pharmacological agents available for EphA receptors, we designed recombinant immunoadhesins that specifically bind to the receptor binding site of the ephrin-A ligand (antagonist) or the ligand binding site of the EphA receptor (agonist) and thus target EphA function. We demonstrate that intrahippocampal infusion of an EphA antagonist immunoadhesin leads to impaired performance in two behavioral paradigms, T-maze spontaneous alternation and context-dependent fear conditioning, sensitive to hippocampal function, whereas activation of EphA by infusion of an agonist immunoadhesin results in enhanced performance on these tasks. Because the two behavioral tasks have different motivational, perceptual, and motor requirements, we infer the changes were not caused by these performance factors but rather to cognitive alterations. We also find bidirectional changes in gene expression and in electrophysiological measures of synaptic efficacy that correlate with the behavioral results. Thus, EphA receptors and their ligands are implicated as mediators of plasticity in the adult mammalian brain.',\n",

Immunohistochemistry was performed using well-characterized antibodies against each of the five proteins analyzed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival material. Forty-three normal endometrial samples (16 proliferative, 19 secretory, and 8 hyperplastic) and 41 endometrial adenocarcinoma cases were analyzed. There was variable expression of the growth factor receptors and the ligands in the two principal phases of the menstrual cycle as well as in endometrial adenocarcinoma. In normal endometrium, the c-erbB-3 receptor was weakly expressed in both phases. The c-erbB-4 receptor and all of the ligands examined, neuregulin alpha, neuregulin beta, and betacellulin, were expressed at significantly higher levels in the secretory as compared with the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, suggesting a role for these proteins in endometrial maturation. In endometrial adenocarcinoma, overexpression of c-erbB-3, c-erbB-4, and betacellulin with underexpression of neuregulin a as compared with normal controls was observed. Neuregulin beta expression was not found to be significantly different in the two groups. These results suggest that signaling through the c-erbB-3 and c-erbB-4 receptors and the ligands neuregulin alpha, neuregulin beta, and betacellulin are important in endometrial carcinogenesis.',\n",

It has an extended extracellular segment containing several adhesion molecule structure motifs, and has been shown to interact with the human complement regulator, decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD55). To understand further the interaction between CD97 and DAF, as well as the structure and function of CD97 in general, we have cloned the mouse CD97 cDNA and studied the encoded protein for its membrane association property and ability to interact specifically with the murine decay-accelerating factor. The full-length mouse CD97 cDNA that we have cloned and characterized encodes a protein that is 60% identical to the three epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain-containing form of human CD97 but does not contain the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif which is present in human CD97. Two other alternatively spliced forms of mouse CD97 were also identified. These forms differ by the number of EGF-like sequence repeats present in the N-terminal region. Northern blot analysis revealed that CD97 is expressed widely in mouse tissues and in resting as well as activated cultured mouse splenocytes. Transient transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with the mouse CD97 cDNA in a green-fluorescence protein vector (pEGFP-N1) showed plasma membrane targeting of the expressed protein. Western blot analysis confirmed its membrane association and identified the existence of a processed C-terminal fragment, supporting the notion that CD97 on the cell membrane is composed of post-translationally generated subunits. Adhesion studies demonstrated that normal, but not DAF knockout mouse erythrocytes and splenocytes adhered to mouse CD97-transfected HEK cells. The interaction of CD97 and DAF was found to be species-restrictive in that human erythrocytes were unable to bind to mouse CD97-transfected HEK cells. These results indicate that the general structure, membrane association property and DAF-binding ability of CD97 are conserved and that the adhesive interaction between CD97 and DAF is independent of the RGD motif. The finding that CD97 is distributed widely among various mouse tissues suggests that CD97 may have other roles beyond lymphocyte activation.',\n",

Sidechain atoms of the three residues, Trp(4), His(8) and Phe(9) orient toward the same direction and these residues might play a key role on interacting with hydrophobic acyl chains of the phospholipids in the membrane. NOESY experiments performed on NMB in non-deuterated SDS micelle show that aromatic ring protons of Trp(4) and Phe(9) residues are in close contact with methylene protons of SDS micelles. In addition, proton longitudinal relaxation data proved that the interactions between NMB with SDS micelle are characterized as extrinsic interaction.

In this report, we demonstrate that both GRP and another member of the bombesin family of peptides, neuromedin B (NMB), are also autocrine growth factors for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14 of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were produced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were produced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times that of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were equivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR and NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was adapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed A549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium. Using either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and GRP were found to be mitogens for three NSCLC cell lines that express mRNA for BLP receptors and secrete BLPs, regardless of which peptide and/or receptor subtype was detected. The monoclonal antibody 2A11, which preferentially recognizes GRP, was able to block the in vitro proliferative response to GRP in the BrDU incorporation assay, and partially blocked the response to NMB. The 2A11 antibody could only partially block the in vivo growth of cell lines that showed proliferative responses to BLPs. 2A11 antibody was more effective against the 239T cell line, which secreted a low amount of GRP into the medium (0.6 nM), compared to the 201T cell line, which secreted a higher amount of both GRP and NMB (4.2 nM and 36.6 nM, respectively). These results suggest that both NMB and GRP are autocrine growth factors for NSCLC, but that the production of NMB and expression of the NMBR may be more prominent than the production of GRP and expression of the GRP receptor. If BLP ligand-receptor systems are to be targeted therapeutically in NSCLC, it will be necessary to inhibit both NMB and GRP.',\n",

To identify the receptor interacting with mJagged1 and to gain insight into its binding characteristics, we established two experimental systems using fusion proteins comprising various extracellular parts of mJagged1, a \"cell\" binding assay and a \"solid-phase\" binding assay. mJagged1 physically bound to mouse Notch2 (mNotch2) on the cell surface and to a purified extracellular portion of mNotch2, respectively, in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Scatchard analysis of mJagged1 binding to BaF3 cells and to the soluble Notch2 protein demonstrated dissociation constants of 0.4 and 0.7 nM, respectively, and that the number of mJagged1-binding sites on BaF3 is 5,548 per cell. Furthermore, deletion mutant analyses showed that the DSL domain of mJagged1 is a minimal binding unit and is indispensable for binding to mNotch2. The epidermal growth factor-like repeats of mJagged1 modulate the affinity of the interaction, with the first and second repeats playing a major role. Finally, solid-phase binding assay showed that Jagged1 binds to Notch1 and Notch3 in addition to Notch2, suggesting that mJagged1 is a ligand for multiple Notch receptors.',\n",

It consists of 2185 amino acid residues encoded by a 9-kilobase pair mRNA; several splice variants have been detected in human and rat cDNA libraries. Sequence comparison suggests that the novel multidomain protein, together with cortactin-binding protein, forms a family of cytoskeletal anchoring proteins. Fractionation of rat brain membranes indicated that somatostatin receptor interacting protein is enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction. The interaction of somatostatin receptor subtype 2 with its interacting protein was verified by overlay assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments from transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Somatostatin receptor subtype 2 and the interacting protein display a striking overlap of their expression patterns in the rat brain.

Moreover, Hfz1 deletion mutants with truncated carboxy termini showed markedly reduced capacity to enhance Wnt signal transduction. Specificity was demonstrated with respect to signal transduction by different Wnts.

However, coimmunoprecipitation of Hfz1 with both Wnt-3a and Wnt-5a indicated that TCF dependent signaling in response to Wnts is not determined solely by their ability to bind the receptor.

We evaluated the properties of C(6)-VIP, its analog AcHis(1)-VIP, and the VPAC(2)-selective agonist Ro 25-1553 on the wild-type VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) receptors and on the chimeric receptors exchanging the different domains between both receptors. VIP had a normal affinity and efficacy on the chimeras starting with the amino-terminal VPAC(2) receptor sequence. The binding and functional profile of these chimeric receptors suggested that the high affinity of Ro 25-1553 for VPAC(2) receptors is supported by the amino-terminal extracellular domain, whereas the ability to prefer C(6)-VIP over VIP is supported by the VPAC(2) fifth transmembrane (TM5)-EC(3) receptor domain. These results further support the hypothesis that the central and carboxyl-terminal regions of the peptide (modified in RO 25-1553) recognize the extracellular amino-terminal region domain, whereas the amino-terminal VIP amino acids bind to the TM receptor core. VIP had a reduced affinity and efficacy on the N-VPAC(1)/VPAC(2) and on the N-->EC(2)-VPAC(1)/VPAC(2) chimeric receptors. C(6)-VIP behaved as a high-affinity agonist on these constructions.

Binding requires calcium, and it is inhibited in the presence of apoE. Furthermore, the CR-50 monoclonal antibody, which inhibits Reelin function, blocks the association of Reelin with VLDLR. After binding to VLDLR on the cell surface, Reelin is internalized into vesicles. In dissociated neurons, apoE reduces the level of Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1.

We show that Reelin binds directly and specifically to the ectodomains of VLDLR and ApoER2 in vitro and that blockade of VLDLR and ApoER2 correlates with loss of Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Disabled-1 in cultured primary embryonic neurons. Furthermore, mice that lack either Reelin or both VLDLR and ApoER2 exhibit hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-stabilizing protein tau.

The antibodies reacted predominantly with monocytes, granulocytes, dendritic cells, and their precursors, as well as with bone marrow CD34(+), AC133(+), CD90(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. In contrast, SIRP expression was absent or significantly reduced on the majority of myeloid blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Functional studies showed that the extracellular domains of SIRPalpha1 and SIRPalpha2 support adhesion of a number of primary hematopoietic cells and cell lines. This interaction could be blocked by 4 of 7 SIRPalpha1-reactive MoAbs. In addition, SIRPalpha1 and SIRPalpha2 competed for the same cell binding site, suggesting a common widely expressed SIRP ligand. In an approach to identify this molecule, MoAbs were generated against the SIRP-binding cell line CCRF-CEM, and MoAb CC2C6 was selected because of its capacity to inhibit cell binding to SIRPalpha1. Further analysis showed that this antibody recognized CD47, a ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane protein previously implicated in integrin function, host defense action, and neutrophil migration.

The GM-CSF receptor consists of two subunits: GMRalpha, which binds GM-CSF with low affinity, and GMRbeta, which lacks intrinsic ligand-binding capability but complexes with GMRalpha to form a high-affinity receptor (GMRalpha/beta). We conducted dynamic kinetic analyses of GM-CSF receptors to define the role of GMRbeta in the interaction of ligand and receptor. Our data show that GMRalpha/beta exhibits a higher k(on) than GMRalpha, indicating that GMRbeta facilitates ligand acquisition to the binding pocket. Heterogeneity with regard to GM-CSF dissociation from GMRalpha/beta points to the presence of loose and tight ligand-receptor complexes in high-affinity binding. Although the loose complex has a k(off) similar to GMRalpha, the lower k(off) indicates that GMRbeta inhibits GM-CSF release from the tight receptor complex. The two rates of ligand dissociation may provide for discrete mechanisms of interaction between GM-CSF and its high-affinity receptor. These results show that the beta subunit functions to stabilize ligand binding as well as to facilitate ligand acquisition.',\n",

The differential ligand binding specificity of these two receptors was exploited to map specific ligand binding regions in mutant and chimeric receptor molecules. Deletion of immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain I did not effect ligand binding, thus localizing the binding region(s) to the distal two Ig domains. Mapping studies identified two regions that contribute to FGF binding. Additionally, FGF2 binding showed positive cooperativity, suggesting the presence of two binding sites on a single FGFR or two interacting sites on an FGFR dimer. Analysis of FGF8 and FGF9 binding to chimeric receptors showed that a broad region spanning Ig domain II and sequences further N-terminal determines binding specificity for these ligands.

CR-Fc binding and non-binding forms of Sn, probably derived from CR-Fc(+) and CR-Fc(-) cells respectively, were selected from spleen lysates. Analysis of the glycan pool associated with the CR-Fc-binding form revealed the presence of charged structures resistant to sialidase, absent in the non-binding form, that could correspond to sulfated structures.

Although the third intracellular loops of the three splice variants were identical, their N-terminal extracellular domains differed. The first full-length PAC1 variant, PAC1normal (PAC1n), encoded the entire N-terminus, whereas the second variant named PAC1short (PAC1s) was deleted by 21 amino acids (residues 89-109). Finally, the third variant, named PAC1very short (PAC1vs), was deleted by 57 amino acids (residues 53-109). Using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, it was established that all three variants were expressed in neuronal tissues. Binding- and cAMP studies using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably transfected with PAC1n, PAC1s and PAC1vs showed significant differences in the affinities and selectivities towards PACAP38, PACAP27 and VIP. PAC1n bound PACAP38 and PACAP27 with affinities in the low nanomolar range whereas VIP was bound with up to 400-fold lower affinity. PAC1vs preferentially bound PACAP38 (Ki=121 nM) and PACAP27 (Ki=129 nM) over VIP (Ki>1000 nM) but with 100-fold lower affinity than PAC1n. Surprisingly, PAC1s unselectively bound all three ligands with high affinity. These data indicate that residues 53-88 within the N-terminal domain of the PAC1 are important for high affinity ligand binding, whereas residues 89-109 determine the receptor's ligand selectivity.\",\n",

In the present study, permeabilized platelets were found to react with a monoclonal antibody to laminin gamma1 chain by immunofluorescence. In Western blot analysis of platelet lysates, several monoclonal antibodies to gamma1 and beta1 laminin chains recognized 220- to 230-kDa polypeptides, under reducing conditions, and a structure with much slower electrophoretic mobility under nonreducing conditions. Immunoaffinity purification on a laminin beta1 antibody-Sepharose column yielded polypeptides of 230, 220, 200, and 180 kDa from platelet lysates. In the purified material, mAbs to beta1 and gamma1 reacted with the two larger polypeptides, while affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to laminin alpha4 chain recognized the smallest polypeptide. Identity of the polypeptides was confirmed by microsequencing. One million platelets contained on average 1 ng of laminin (approximately 700 molecules per cell), of which 20-35% was secreted within minutes after stimulation with either thrombin or phorbol ester. Platelets adhered to plastic surfaces coated with the purified platelet laminin, and this process was largely inhibited by antibodies to beta1 and alpha6 integrin chains. We conclude that platelets contain and, following activation, secrete laminin-8 (alpha4beta1gamma1) and that the cells adhere to the protein by using alpha6beta1 integrin.',\n",

A thrombin-cleaved NH(2)-terminal fragment of osteopontin containing the RGD sequence has recently been shown to also be a ligand for alpha(9)beta(1). In this report, we used site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides to identify the alpha(9)beta(1) recognition sequence in osteopontin. alpha(9)-transfected SW480, Chinese hamster ovary, and L-cells adhered to a recombinant NH(2)-terminal osteopontin fragment in which the RGD site was mutated to RAA (nOPN-RAA). Adhesion was completely inhibited by anti-alpha(9) monoclonal antibody Y9A2, indicating the presence of a non-RGD alpha(9)beta(1) recognition sequence within this fragment. Alanine substitution mutagenesis of 13 additional conserved negatively charged amino acid residues in this fragment had no effect on alpha(9)beta(1)-mediated adhesion, but adhesion was dramatically inhibited by either alanine substitution or deletion of tyrosine 165. A synthetic peptide, SVVYGLR, corresponding to the sequence surrounding Tyr(165), blocked alpha(9)beta(1)-mediated adhesion to nOPN-RAA and exposed a ligand-binding-dependent epitope on the integrin beta(1) subunit on alpha(9)-transfected, but not on mock-transfected cells.

These complexes of peptide and class I MHC (pMHC) are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. If a clonotypic T cell receptor expressed on a circulating T cell binds to the pMHC complex, the cell presenting the pMHC is killed. In this manner, some tumor cells expressing aberrant proteins are recognized and removed by the immune system. However, not all tumors are recognized efficiently. One reason hypothesized for poor T cell recognition of tumor-associated peptides is poor binding of those peptides to class I MHC molecules. Many peptides, derived from the proto-oncogene HER-2/neu have been shown to be recognized by cytotoxic T cells derived from HLA-A2(+) patients with breast cancer and other adenocarcinomas. Seven of these peptides were found to bind with intermediate to poor affinity. In particular, GP2 (HER-2/neu residues 654-662) binds very poorly even though it is predicted to bind well based upon the presence of the correct HLA-A2.1 peptide-binding motif. Altering the anchor residues to those most favored by HLA-A2.1 did not significantly improve binding affinity.

Our aim was to identify the amino acid of the cholecystokinin-A receptor (CCK-AR) binding site in an interaction with the sulfate of CCK, which is crucial for CCK binding and activity. A three-dimensional model of the [CCK-AR-CCK] complex was built. In this model, Arg197 was the best candidate residue for a ionic interaction with the sulfate of CCK. Arg197 was exchanged for a methionine by site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type and mutated CCK-AR were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells for pharmacological and functional analysis. The mutated receptor on Arg197 did not bind the agonist radioligand 125I-BH-[Thr, Nle]-CCK-9; however, it bound the nonpeptide antagonist [3H]-SR27,897 as the wild-type receptor. The mutant was approximately 1,470- and 3,200-fold less potent than the wild-type CCK-AR to activate G proteins and to induce inositol phosphate production, respectively. This is consistent with the 500-fold lower potency and 800-fold lower affinity of nonsulfated CCK relative to sulfated CCK on the wild-type receptor. These data, together with those showing that the mutated receptor failed to discriminate nonsulfated and sulfated CCK while it retained other pharmacological features of the CCK-AR, strongly support an interaction between Arg197 of the CCK-AR binding site and the sulfate of CCK. In addition, the mutated CCK-AR resembled the low affinity state of the wild-type CCK-AR, suggesting that Arg197-sulfate interaction regulates conformational changes of the CCK-AR that are required for its physiological activation.',\n",

So far, interest in Mel 1a receptor signaling has focused mainly on the modulation of the adenylyl cyclase pathway via pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins. To further investigate signaling of the human Mel 1a receptor, we have developed an antibody directed against the C terminus of this receptor. This antibody detected the Mel 1a receptor as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 60 kDa in immunoblots after separation by SDS-PAGE. It also specifically precipitated the 2-[125I]iodomelatonin (125I-Mel)-labeled receptor from Mel 1a-transfected HEK 293 cells. Coprecipitation experiments showed that G(i2), G(i3), and G(q/11) proteins couple to the Mel 1a receptor in an agonist-dependent and guanine nucleotide-sensitive manner. Coupling was selective since other G proteins present in HEK 293 cells, (G(i1), G(o), G(s), G(z), and G12) were not detected in receptor complexes. Coupling of the Mel 1a receptor to G(i) and G(q) was confirmed by inhibition of high-affinity 125I-Mel binding to receptors with subtype-selective G protein alpha-subunit antibodies. G(i2) and/or G(i3) mediated adenylyl cyclase inhibition while G(q/11) induced a transient elevation in cytosolic calcium concentrations in HEK 293 cells stably expressing Mel 1a receptors. Melatonin-induced cytosolic calcium mobilization via PTX-insensitive G proteins was confirmed in primary cultures of ovine pars tuberalis cells endogenously expressing Mel 1a receptors. In conclusion, we report the development of the first antibody recognizing the cloned human Mel 1a melatonin receptor protein. We show that Mel 1a receptors functionally couple to both PTX-sensitive and PTX-insensitive G proteins. The previously unknown signaling of Mel 1a receptors through G(q/11) widens the spectrum of potential targets for melatonin.',\n",

RT-PCR amplification of CRH receptor sequences from human myometrium and fetal membranes yielded cDNAs that encode a novel CRH-R type 1 spliced variant. This variant (CRH-R1d) is present in the human pregnant myometrium at term only, which suggests a physiologically important role at the end of human pregnancy and labor. The amino acid sequence of CRH-R1d is identical to the CRH-R1alpha receptor except that it contains an exon deletion resulting in the absence of 14 amino acids in the predicted seventh transmembrane domain. Binding studies in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the CRH-R1d or CRH-R1alpha receptors revealed that the deletion does not change the binding characteristics of the variant receptor. In contrast, studies on the G protein activation demonstrated that CRH-R1d is not well coupled to the four subtypes of G proteins (G(s), G(i), G(o), G(q)) that CRH-R1alpha can activate. These data suggest that although the deleted segment is not important for CRH binding, it plays a crucial role in CRH receptor signal transduction. Second messenger studies of the variant receptor showed that CRH and CRH-like peptides can stimulate the adenylate cyclase system, with reduced sensitivity and potency by 10-fold compared with the CRH-R1alpha. Furthermore, CRH failed to stimulate inositol trisphosphate production. Coexpression studies between the CRH-R1d or CRH-R1alpha showed that this receptor does not play a role as a dominant negative receptor for CRH.',\n",

The radioligands used labelled saturable and high-affinity populations of sites in each instance; at sst1-4 receptors maximum binding (Bmax) was roughly equivalent. By contrast, at sst5 receptors Bmax determined with [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I][Tyr3]octreotide was significantly lower (two-and eightfold) compared with [125I]LTT-SRIF28 and [125I][Tyr10]CST14. Experiments were performed with the stable GTP-analogue guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp) to establish guanine nucleotide sensitivity of agonist binding to sst1-5 receptors. The sensitivity towards GppNHp was quite variable depending on receptor and/or ligand. At sst1 and sst4 receptors, GppNHp produced little effect overall, whereas binding to sst3 and sst2 receptors was reduced by 70 and >80%, respectively. At sst5 receptors, the binding of [125I]LTT-SRIF28 and [125I][Tyr10]CST14 was only slightly affected by GppNHp, while [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I][Tyr3]octreotide binding was almost entirely inhibited. Thus, [125I][Tyr3]octreotide labelled about 26-fold less sst5 receptors than [125I]LTT-SRIF28, in the presence of 10 microM GppNHp. These discrepancies in guanine nucleotide sensitivity, were confirmed in GppNHp competition experiments. Competition studies were performed at the five receptors labelled with the different radioligands to establish their respective pharmacological profiles: the rank order of affinity was largely radioligand-independent at sst1-4 receptors, in contrast to sst5 receptors where it was radioligand-dependent. Thus, the pharmacological profile of [125I]LTT-SRIF28- and [125I][Tyr10]CST14-labelled sst5 sites correlated highly significantly, but did not correlate with the affinity profiles defined with [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I][Tyr3]octreotide binding to sst5 receptors. Depending on the agonist radioligand used and the receptor studied, it would appear that binding can be essentially to a guanine nucleotide-sensitive state (e.g. sst2 or sst3), a guanine nucleotide-insensitive state (sst1 or sst4) or a mixture of both (sst5); in the latter case, each radioligand defining a more or less different rank order of affinity at the same receptor. In summary, the differences in agonist receptor binding and guanine nucleotide sensitivity cannot be explained by the ternary complex model or its variations, but rather suggest the existence of multiple agonist-specific receptor states which vary from one receptor to another.',\n",

In its native state, gp120(LAI) is able to elicit specific multimolecular complexes with these membrane ligands at the surface of the cells; most of the interactions are abolished by mannan or heparin but not by dextran. Similarly, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha interacts not only with CXCR4 expressed by CXCR4(+) CD4(+) U937, CEM, and HOS-CD4(+) CXCR4(+) cells but also with CD4 expressed by intact U937, CEM, and HOS-CD4(+) CXCR4(+/-) cells or electroblotted onto Immobilon. SDF-1alpha binding to CD4(+) CXCR4(+/-) cells, or soluble CD4 electroblotted onto Immobilon, is significantly inhibited by sCD4, whereas truncated sCD4 lacking D3 and D4 domains had no significant effect, which indicates that SDF-1 binds to CD4 but at regions different from the HIV-gp120-binding site. Heparin and mannan also inhibit SDF-1alpha binding to intact CD4(+) CXCR4(+/-) cells, and electroblotted soluble CD4. Heparitinase treatment of such cells reduced SDF-1alpha binding. These data demonstrate that glycans and glycosaminoglycans are directly or indirectly involved in the interactions of HIV-1 gp120(LAI) and of SDF-1alpha with membrane ligands of CD4(+) CXCR4(+) cells and thus could play a role both in HIV-1 infection and in the physiology of SDF-1alpha.',\n",

We had earlier provided evidence that GCC, present in the human colonic T84 cell line, is desensitized on prolonged exposure to ST, and this desensitization was reflected in a reduced ST-stimulated guanylate cyclase activity of GCC [Bakre, M.M. & Visweswariah, S.S. (1997) FEBS Lett. 408, 345-349]. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms that underlie this cellular desensitization process. Desensitization of T84 cells was not a result of reduction in GCC present in membranes prepared from desensitized T84 cells, nor due to increased cGMP-phosphodiesterase activity associated with the membrane fraction. The decrease in ST-stimulatable guanylate cyclase activity of GCC was due to a dramatic reduction in the Vmax of the cyclase, which was also seen when MnGTP was used as the substrate. GCC undergoes ligand-induced inactivation in vitro, which is alleviated in the presence of ATP. In vivo desensitized GCC could be further inactivated in vitro when preincubated with ST, indicating that the two mechanisms of GCC inactivation are distinct. Cellular refractoriness as reflected by a reduced responsiveness to further ST-stimulation following prior exposure to IST, coupled with GCC desensitization was also observed in another colonic cell line, Caco2. However, HEK293 cells, stably transfected with GCC cDNA, when exposed to ST for prolonged periods, did not result in GCC desensitization, indicating that desensitization of GCC appeared to be a cell specific phenomenon. GCC expressed in HEK293-GCC cells, however, showed in vitro ligand induced inactivation, suggesting that there are two independent means of ligand-induced desensitization of GCC, perhaps distinct from the mechanisms that have been described earlier for other members of the guanylate cyclase receptor family.',\n",

We also compared their inhibition of myeloperoxidase (MPO) secretion from human PMNs and their inhibition of human umbilical artery contraction induced by human recombinant C5a. 2. In both PMNs and umbilical artery, the cyclic and acyclic C5a antagonists displayed insurmountable antagonism against C5a. There were differences in selectivities for the C5aR with F-[OPdChaWR] (pKb 8.64+/-0.21) being 30 times more potent than MeFKPdChaWr (pKb 7.16+/-0.11, P<0.05) in PMNs, but of similar potency (pKb 8.19+/-0.38 vs pKb 8.28+/-0.29, respectively) in umbilical artery. This trend was also reflected in their relative binding affinities, both antagonists having similar affinities (-logIC50 values) for C5aR in umbilical artery membranes (F-[OPdChaWR], 7.00+/-0.46; MeFKPdChaWr, 7.23+/-0.17), whereas in PMN membranes the C5aR affinity of the cycle F-[OPdChaWR] (7.05+/-0. 06) was four times higher than that of acyclic MeFKPdChaWr (6.43+/-0. 24, P<0.05). 3. In summary, the results reveal that these antagonists are insurmountable in nature against C5a for C5aR on at least two human cell types, and the differences in relative receptor binding affinities and antagonistic potencies against C5a are consistent with differences in receptors within these cell types. The nature of these differences is yet to be elucidated.',\n",

In this study, we examined whether C3 has conserved affinity for LRP/alpha(2)MR. Ligand blot experiments with human (125)I-C3 on endosomal proteins show binding to a 600-kDa protein, indistinguishable from LRP/alpha(2)MR by the following criteria: it is competed by receptor-associated protein (the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein that impairs binding of all ligands to LRP/alpha(2)MR) and by lactoferrin and Pseudomonas exotoxin, other well known ligands of the multifunctional receptor. Binding of C3 is sensitive to reduction of the receptor and is Ca(2+)-dependent. All these features are typical for cysteine-rich binding repeats of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. In LRP/alpha(2)MR, they are found in four cassettes (2, 8, 10, and 11 repeats). Ligand blotting to chicken LR8 demonstrates that a single 8-fold repeat is sufficient for binding. Confocal microscopy visualizes initial surface labeling of human fibroblasts incubated with fluorescent labeled C3, which changes after 5 min to an intracellular vesicular staining pattern that is abolished in the presence of receptor-associated protein. Cell uptake is abolished in mouse fibroblasts deficient in LRP/alpha(2)MR. Native plasma C3 is not internalized. We demonstrate that the capacity to internalize C3 is saturable and exhibits a K(D) value of 17 nM. After intravenous injection, rat hepatocytes accumulate C3 in sedimentable vesicles with a density typical for endosomes.

We found that the interaction of nectin-2alpha with afadin was necessary for their clustering at cell-cell contact sites. However, nectin-2alpha-DeltaC showed cis dimerization and trans interaction, both of which did not require the interaction of nectin-2alpha with afadin. We have previously shown in EL cells that the interaction of nectin-1 with afadin is necessary for its recruitment to adherens junctions. We found that the trans interaction of nectin-2alpha was furthermore necessary for this recruitment.

We recently characterized the closely related orphan family member, GPR38, as the motilin receptor. A common property of both receptors is that they amplify and sustain pulsatile biological responses in the continued presence of their respective ligands. To efficiently identify additional members of this new GPCR family, we explored a vertebrate species having a compact genome, that was evolutionary distant from human, but where functionally important genes were likely to be conserved. Accordingly, three distinct full-length clones, encoding proteins of significant identity to the human GHS-R, were isolated from the Pufferfish (Spheroides nephelus). Southern analyses showed that the three cloned Pufferfish genes are highly conserved across species. The gene with closest identity (58%) was activated by three synthetic ligands that were chosen for their very high selectivity on the GHS-R as illustrated by their specificity in activating the wild-type human GHS-R but not the E124Q mutant. These results indicate that the ligand activation domain of the GHS-R has been evolutionary conserved from Pufferfish to human (400 million years), supporting the notion that the GHS-R and its natural ligand play a fundamentally important role in biology. Furthermore, they illustrate the power of exploiting the compact Pufferfish genome for simplifying the isolation of endocrinologically important receptor families.',\n",

It has been reported that induction of tPA expression may contribute to activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In addition, long-term potentiation (LTP) is significantly decreased in mice lacking tPA. Here we demonstrate that tPA receptor LRP is abundantly expressed in hippocampal neurons and participates in hippocampal LTP. Perfusion of hippocampal slices with receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist for ligand interactions with LRP, significantly reduced late-phase LTP (L-LTP). In addition, RAP also blocked the enhancing effect of synaptic potentiation by exogenous tPA in hippocampal slices prepared from tPA knock-out mice. Metabolic labeling and ligand binding analyses showed that both tPA and LRP are synthesized by hippocampal neurons and that LRP is the major cell surface receptor that binds tPA. Finally, we found that tPA binding to LRP in hippocampal neurons enhances the activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, a key molecule that is known to be involved in L-LTP. Taken together, our results demonstrate that interactions between tPA and cell surface LRP are important for hippocampal L-LTP.\",\n",
       " '10634209': 'Out of the almost 17 members of the TNF superfamily, TNF is probably the most potent inducer of apoptosis. TNF activates both cell-survival and cell-death mechanisms simultaneously. Activation of NF-kB-dependent genes regulates the survival and proliferative effects pf TNF, whereas activation of caspases regulates the apoptotic effects. TNF-induced apoptosis is mediated primarily through the activation of type I receptors, the death domain of which recruits more than a dozen different signaling proteins, which together are considered part of an apoptotic cascade. This cascade does not, however, account for the role of reactive oxygen intermediates, ceramide, phospholipases, and serine proteases which are also implicated in TNF-induced apoptosis. This cascade also does not explain how type II TNF receptors which lack the death domain, induce apoptosis. Nevertheless, this review of apoptosis signaling will be limited to those proteins that makeup the cascade.',\n",

We have demonstrated that two different forms of IL-4R exist, classical and alternative. Classical IL-4R is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and consists of IL-4R p140 (beta) and IL-2R gamma (gamma c) chains. The alternative form of IL-4R is predominantly expressed in nonhematopoietic cells and consists of IL-4R beta and IL-13R alpha' chains. Moreover, the alternative form of IL-4R is also used as a functional component in the IL-13R complex. For signal transduction through IL-4R and IL-13R, we have demonstrated that in nonhematopoietic cells, Janus protein tyrosine kinase (JAK) 2 is phosphorylated and activated instead of JAK3 tyrosine kinase. While JAK3 is required for signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT6) activation in hematopoietic cells, we recently demonstrated that in nonhematopoietic cells JAK2 is required for STAT6 activation for the alternative form of IL-4R. Thus, a major difference exists between hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells with regard to structure and signal transduction through the IL-4R and IL-13R systems.\",\n",

We constructed a yeast signaling system that resolves domain-specific functions of binding from coupling in the Galpha subunit. The endogenous yeast Galpha subunit, Gpa1, does not bind to PAR1 and served as a null structural template. N- and C-terminal portions of mammalian G(i2) and G(16) were substituted back into the Gpa1 template and gain-of-function assessed. The C-terminal third of G(16), but not of G(i2), provides sufficient interactions for coupling to occur with PAR1. The N-terminal two-thirds of G(i2) also contains sufficient determinants to bind and couple to PAR1 and overcome the otherwise negative or missing interactions supplied by the C-terminal third of Gpa1. Replacement of the N-terminal alpha-helix of G(i2), residues 1-34, with those of Gpa1 abolishes coupling but not binding to PAR1 or to betagamma subunits. These data support a model that the N-terminal alphaN helix of the Galpha subunit is physically interposed between PAR1 and the Gbeta subunit and directly assists in transferring the signal between agonist-activated receptor and G protein.',\n",

Its critical role in T cell-dependent humoral immune responses was demonstrated by patients with the hyper-IgM syndrome, as well as by gene targeting in mice. However, in recent years it has become clear that CD40 is expressed much more broadly, including expression on monocytes, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. In addition, the CD40-ligand (CD40-L/CD154), a member of the TNF family, is also expressed more widely than activated CD4+ T cells only. Therefore it is now thought that CD40-CD40-L interactions play a more general role in immune regulation. Collectively these studies have culminated in pre-clinical and clinical studies that are in progress. This article reviews recent developments in this field of research, with main emphasis on (1) structure and expression of CD40 and its ligand; (2) CD40 signal transduction; (3) in vitro function of CD40 on different cell types; and (4) in vivo functions of CD40/CD40-L interactions.',\n",

Here, expression of an EphB6 ligand in the pro-B leukemic cell line, Reh, is demonstrated by binding of soluble EphB6-Fc fusion protein to the Reh cells. The ligand belongs to the subgroup of membrane spanning ligands, as suggested by the fact that phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment did not abrogate binding of EphB6-Fc. Two transmembrane Eph receptor ligands, ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2, were identified in Reh cells. Analysis of EphB6-Fc fusion protein binding to ephrin-B1 or ephrin-B2 transfected COS cells revealed a high-affinity saturable binding between EphB6-Fc and ephrin-B2, but not with ephrin-B1. In mice, EphB6 has previously been shown to be expressed in thymus. Here, we show expression of EphB6 in human thymus, as well as the expression of ephrin-B2 in both human and mouse thymus.

Our observations also indicate that MMP-9, as well as MMP-2, proteolytically cleaves latent TGF-beta, providing a novel and potentially important mechanism for TGF-beta activation. In addition, we show that MMP-9 localization to the surface of normal keratinocytes is CD44 dependent and can activate latent TGF-beta.

CR3 is one of eight related repeats that constitute a major ligand binding region of LRP. The structure is very similar in overall fold to homologous complement-like repeat CR8 from LRP and complement-like repeats LB1, LB2, and LB5 from the low density lipoprotein receptor and contains a short two-strand antiparallel beta-sheet, a one turn alpha-helix, and a high affinity calcium site with coordination from four carboxyls and two backbone carbonyls. The surface electrostatics and topography are, however, quite distinct from each of these other repeats. Two-dimensional (1)H,(15)N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra provide evidence for a specific, though relatively weak (K(d) approximately 140 microM), interaction between CR3 and human alpha2-macroglobulin receptor binding domain that involves a contiguous patch of surface residues in the central region of CR3. This specific interaction is consistent with a mode of LRP binding to ligands that uses contributions from more than one domain to generate a wide array of different binding sites, each with overall high affinity.',\n",

The K12 (SECTM1) protein was originally identified by its location just upstream of the CD7 locus. The K12 gene encodes a transmembrane protein of unknown function. In order to clone a K12-binding protein, we generated a soluble version of the human K12 protein by fusing its extracellular domain to the Fc portion of human IgG(1). Flow cytometry experiments showed that the K12-Fc fusion protein bound at high levels to both human T and NK cells. Precipitation experiments using K12-Fc on (35)S-radiolabeled NK cells lysates indicated that the K12 cognate was an approximately 40-kDa protein. A human peripheral blood T cell cDNA expression library was screened with the K12-Fc protein, and two independent, positive cDNA clones were identified and sequenced. Both cDNAs encoded the same protein, which was CD7. Thus, K12 and CD7 are cognate proteins that are located next to each other on human chromosome 17q25. Additionally, we have cloned the gene encoding the mouse homologue of K12, shown that it maps near the mouse CD7 gene on chromosome 11, and established that the mouse K12 protein binds to mouse, but not human, CD7. Mouse K12-Fc inhibited in a dose-dependent manner concanavalin A-induced proliferation, but not anti-TcRalpha/beta induced proliferation, of mouse lymph node T cells.

In the present study, four human and two mouse isoforms, resulting from mRNA splicing and found in various cDNA libraries, were expressed, purified, and assessed for binding and neutralization of IL-18 biological activities. Human IL-18BP isoform a (IL-18BPa) exhibited the greatest affinity for IL-18 with a rapid on-rate, a slow off-rate, and a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 399 pM. IL-18BPc shares the Ig domain of IL-18BPa except for the 29 C-terminal amino acids; the K(d) of IL-18BPc is 10-fold less (2.94 nM). Nevertheless, IL-18BPa and IL-18BPc neutralize IL-18 >95% at a molar excess of two. IL-18BPb and IL-18BPd isoforms lack a complete Ig domain and lack the ability to bind or neutralize IL-18. Murine IL-18BPc and IL-18BPd isoforms, possessing the identical Ig domain, also neutralize >95% murine IL-18 at a molar excess of two. However, murine IL-18BPd, which shares a common C-terminal motif with human IL-18BPa, also neutralizes human IL-18. Molecular modeling identified a large mixed electrostatic and hydrophobic binding site in the Ig domain of IL-18BP, which could account for its high affinity binding to the ligand. It is likely that preferential secretion of functional and nonfunctional isoforms of IL-18BP affect the immune response.',\n",

Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma production is diminished, and IL-10 production is increased. A phosphorylation-dependent interaction between the amino-terminal portion of Eta-1 and its integrin receptor stimulated IL-12 expression, whereas a phosphorylation-independent interaction with CD44 inhibited IL-10 expression.

The Ic50 for displacement of 125I-CKbeta8 (25-99) with CKbeta8 (25-99) was 0.22 nM. The longer forms of CKbeta8 (24-99 and 1-99) also displaced 125I-CKbeta8, with Ic50 values of 6.5 and 16 nM, respectively. Displacement profiles of 125I-CKbeta8 (25-99) on freshly prepared human monocytes indicated that CCR1 was the major receptor for CKbeta8. We conclude that CCR1 is a receptor for different-length CKbeta8 and that CKbeta8 (25-99) has a similar affinity for CCR1 as macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha). The longer variants of CKbeta8 are significantly less potent than CKbeta8 (25-99) and MIP-1a on CCR1 and monocytes (P < 0.05).',\n",

E-cadherin cannot participate in these complexes. Cells coexpressing N- and R-cadherins show homophilic adhesion in which these proteins coassociate at cell-cell interfaces. We performed site- directed mutagenesis studies, the results of which support the strand dimer model for cis-dimerization. Furthermore, we show that when N- and R-cadherins are coexpressed in neurons in vitro, the two cadherins colocalize at certain neural synapses, implying biological relevance for these complexes. The present study provides a novel paradigm for cadherin interaction whereby selective cis-heterodimer formation may generate new functional units to mediate cell-cell adhesion.',\n",

For the first time, we show that a chemically synthesized fragment of the IL-2 sequence can fold into a molecule mimicking the quaternary structure of a hemopoietin. Indeed, peptide p1-30 (containing amino acids 1-30, covering the entire alpha helix A of IL-2) spontaneously folds into an alpha-helical homotetramer and stimulates the growth of T cell lines expressing human IL-2Rbeta, whereas shorter versions of the peptide lack helical structure and are inactive. We also demonstrate that this neocytokine interacts with a previously undescribed dimeric form of IL-2Rbeta. In agreement with its binding to IL-2Rbeta, p1-30 activates Shc and p56(lck) but unlike IL-2, fails to activate Janus kinase (Jak)1, Jak3, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). Unexpectedly, we also show that p1-30 activates Tyk2, thus suggesting that IL-2Rbeta may bind to different Jaks depending on its oligomerization. At the cellular level, p1-30 induces lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and preferentially activates CD8(low) lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which constitutively express IL-2Rbeta. A significant interferon gamma production is also detected after p1-30 stimulation. A mutant form of p1-30 (Asp20-->Lys), which is likely unable to induce vascular leak syndrome, remains capable of generating LAK cells, like the original p1-30 peptide. Altogether, our data suggest that p1-30 has therapeutic potential.',\n",

We have investigated whether the type VIII collagen stimulates smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and invasion by binding to integrin receptors and up-regulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production. SMCs attached to plates coated with type VIII collagen in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal attachment occurring with coating solutions containing 25 microgram/ml collagen. Type VIII collagen at 100 microgram/ml stimulated an 83-fold increase in the migration of SMCs in a chemotaxis chamber. Antibodies against beta1 integrin receptors prevented attachment and migration of SMCs. Antibodies against alpha1 or alpha2 integrins reduced attachment of SMCs to type VIII collagen by 29% and 77%, respectively. We found that SMCs grown from the rat neointima, but not medial SMCs, increased their production of MMP-2 and -9 on adherence to type VIII collagen. This suggests that there is an important difference in phenotype between intimal and medial SMCs and that intimal SMCs have distinct matrix-dependent signaling mechanisms. Our findings suggest that type VIII collagen deposited in vascular lesions functions to promote SMC attachment and chemotaxis, and signals through integrin receptors to stimulate MMP synthesis, all of which are important mechanisms used in cell migration and invasion.',\n",

NIK also binds the SH3 domains of the SH2/SH3 adapter protein Nck. To determine whether Nck functions as an adapter to couple NIK to a receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, we determined whether NIK is activated by Eph receptors (EphR). EphRs constitute the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), and members of this family play important roles in patterning of the nervous and vascular systems. In this report, we show that NIK kinase activity is specifically increased in cells stimulated by two EphRs, EphB1 and EphB2. EphB1 kinase activity and phosphorylation of a juxtamembrane tyrosine (Y594), conserved in all Eph receptors, are both critical for NIK activation by EphB1. Although pY594 in the EphB1R has previously been shown to bind the SH2 domain of Nck, we found that stimulation of EphB1 and EphB2 led predominantly to a complex between NIK/Nck, p62(dok), RasGAP, and an unidentified 145-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p62(dok) most probably binds directly to the SH2 domain of Nck and RasGAP and indirectly to NIK bound to the SH3 domain of Nck. We found that NIK activation is also critical for coupling EphB1R to biological responses that include the activation of integrins and JNK by EphB1. Taken together, these findings support a model in which the recruitment of the Ste20 kinase NIK to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins by Nck is an important proximal step in the signaling cascade downstream of EphRs.',\n",

In this study, we investigate the mechanisms by which sEPCR modulates APC function. Soluble EPCR inhibited the inactivation of factor Va by APC only in the presence of phospholipid vesicles. By using flow cytometric analysis in the presence of 3 mM CaCl(2) and 0. 6 mM MgCl(2), sEPCR inhibited the binding of protein C and APC to phospholipid vesicles (K(i) = 40 +/- 7 and 33 +/- 4 nM, respectively). Without MgCl(2), the K(i) values increased approximately 4-fold. Double label flow cytometric analysis using fluorescein-APC and Texas Red-sEPCR indicated that the APC.sEPCR complex does not interact with phospholipid vesicles. By using surface plasmon resonance, we found that sEPCR also inhibited binding of protein C to phospholipid in a dose-dependent fashion (K(i) = 32 nM). To explore the possibility that sEPCR evokes structural changes in APC, fluorescence spectroscopy studies were performed to monitor sEPCR/Fl-APC interactions. sEPCR binds saturably to Fl-APC (K(d) = 27 +/- 13 nM) with a maximum decrease in Fl-APC fluorescence of 10.8 +/- 0.6%. sEPCR also stimulated the amidolytic activity of APC toward synthetic substrates.

Here we report that cell surface transglutaminase mediates adhesion and spreading of cells on the 42-kD fibronectin fragment, which lacks integrin-binding motifs. Overexpression of tissue transglutaminase increases its amount on the cell surface, enhances adhesion and spreading on fibronectin and its 42-kD fragment, enlarges focal adhesions, and amplifies adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. These effects are specific for tissue transglutaminase and are not shared by its functional homologue, a catalytic subunit of factor XIII. Adhesive function of tissue transglutaminase does not require its cross-linking activity but depends on its stable noncovalent association with integrins. Transglutaminase interacts directly with multiple integrins of beta1 and beta3 subfamilies, but not with beta2 integrins. Complexes of transglutaminase with integrins are formed inside the cell during biosynthesis and accumulate on the surface and in focal adhesions. Together our results demonstrate that tissue transglutaminase mediates the interaction of integrins with fibronectin, thereby acting as an integrin-associated coreceptor to promote cell adhesion and spreading.',\n",

Least to most deleterious in this respect are Ala substitutions of Phe(220) approximately W276A < Tyr(131) << Phe(224) </= Asp(130). The dramatic effects of the D130A mutation on nociceptin binding and activity are not reversed in the D130N mutant, whereas those of the Y131A mutation are totally suppressed in Y131F. This suggests that a negative charge at position 130, and a phenyl ring at position 131 in TM III, are critical for occupancy and/or activation of the receptor by nociceptin. Alanine replacement of glutamine 286, located at the C terminus of TM VI, yields a mutant receptor that binds nociceptin with nearly the same affinity as does the wild-type receptor (K(d) values of 0.13 and 0.22 nM, respectively) but, unlike the latter, is unable to mediate nociceptin inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP synthesis in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells (ED(50) > 10,000 nM compared with 0.8 nM at the wild-type receptor).

Addition of Mn(2+) to the adhesion assays did not restore the impaired adhesion. Mutations at alpha(4) Gln(152)Asp(153) also affected transfectant adhesion to sMAdCAM-1-Ig, but did not involve an alteration of alpha(4)beta(7)/MAdCAM-1 binding, and adhesion was restored by Mn(2+).

To seek the mechanisms of PTN signaling, we studied the interactions of PTN with the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) beta/zeta in U373-MG cells. Our results suggest that PTN is a natural ligand for RPTP beta/zeta. PTN signals through \"ligand-dependent receptor inactivation\" of RPTP beta/zeta and disrupts its normal roles in the regulation of steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules. We have found that PTN binds to and functionally inactivates the catalytic activity of RPTP beta/zeta. We also have found that an active site-containing domain of RPTP beta/zeta both binds beta-catenin and functionally reduces its levels of tyrosine phosphorylation when added to lysates of pervanidate-treated cells. In contrast, an (inactivating) active-site mutant of RPTP beta/zeta also binds beta-catenin but fails to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin. Finally, in parallel to its ability to inactivate endogenous RPTP beta/zeta, PTN sharply increases tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin in PTN-treated cells. The results suggest that in unstimulated cells, RPTP beta/zeta is intrinsically active and functions as an important regulator in the reciprocal control of the steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation levels of beta-catenin by tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. The results also suggest that RPTP beta/zeta is a functional receptor for PTN; PTN signals through ligand-dependent receptor inactivation of RPTP beta/zeta to increase levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin to initiate downstream signaling. PTN is the first natural ligand identified for any of the RPTP family; its identification provides a unique tool to pursue the novel signaling pathway activated by PTN and the relationship of PTN signaling with other pathways regulating beta-catenin.',\n",

We report here on human CCX CKR, previously represented only by noncontiguous expressed sequence tags homologous to bovine PPR1, a putative gustatory receptor. We employed a two-tiered process of ligand assignment, where immobilized chemokines constructed on stalks (stalkokines) were used as bait for adhesion of cells expressing CCX CKR. These cells adhered to stalkokines representing ELC, a chemokine previously thought to bind only CCR7. Adhesion was abolished in the presence of soluble ELC, SLC (CCR7 ligands), and TECK (a CCR9 ligand). Complete ligand profiles were further determined by radiolabeled ligand binding and competition with >80 chemokines. ELC, SLC, and TECK comprised high affinity ligands (IC50 <15 nM); lower affinity ligands include BLC and vMIP-II (IC50 <150 nM). With its high affinity for CC chemokines and homology to CC receptors, we provisionally designate this new receptor CCR10.',\n",

Because it has been proposed that only covalently dimerized PSGL-1 can bind P-selectin, we investigated the factors controlling dimerization of PSGL-1 and re-examined whether covalent dimers are required for binding its P-selectin. Recombinant forms of PSGL-1 were created in which the single extracellular Cys (Cys(320)) was replaced with either Ser (C320S-PSGL-1) or Ala (C320A-PSGL-1). Both recombinants migrated as monomeric species of approximately 120 kDa under both nonreducing and reducing conditions on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. P-selectin bound similarly to cells expressing either wild type or mutated forms of PSGL-1 in both flow cytometric and rolling adhesion assays. Unexpectedly, chemical cross-linking studies revealed that both C320S- and C320A-PSGL-1 noncovalently associate in the plasma membrane and cross-linking generates dimeric species. Chimeric recombinants of PSGL-1 in which the transmembrane domain in PSGL-1 was replaced with the transmembrane domain of CD43 (CD43TMD-PSGL-1) could not be chemically cross-linked, suggesting that residues within the transmembrane domain of PSGL-1 are required for noncovalent association. Cells expressing CD43TMD-PSGL-1 bound P-selectin. To further address the ability of P-selectin to bind monomeric derivatives of PSGL-1, intact HL-60 cells were trypsin-treated, which generated a soluble approximately 25-kDa NH(2)-terminal fragment of PSGL-1 that bound to immobilized P-selectin. Because N-glycosylation of PSGL-1 hinders trypsin cleavage, a recombinant form of PSGL-1 was generated in which all three potential N-glycosylation sites were mutated (DeltaN-PSGL-1). Cells expressing DeltaN-PSGL-1 bound P-selectin, and trypsin treatment of the cells generated NH(2)-terminal monomeric fragments (<10 kDa) of PSGL-1 that bound to P-selectin. These results demonstrate that Cys(320)-dependent dimerization of PSGL-1 is not required for binding to P-selectin and that a small monomeric fragment of PSGL-1 is sufficient for P-selectin recognition.',\n",

However, cells can concomitantly express the both receptors and they might have independent functions. Here, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which lack endogenous collagen receptors, were transfected with either alpha(1) or alpha(2) integrin cDNA. Cells were allowed to adhere to various collagen types and their integrin function was tested by observing the progression of cell spreading. The cells expressing alpha(1)beta(1) integrin could spread on collagen types I, III, IV, and V but not on type II, while alpha(2)beta(1) integrin could mediate cell spreading on collagen types I-V. Type XIII is a transmembrane collagen and its interaction with the integrins has not been previously studied. CHO-alpha1beta1 cells could spread on human recombinant type XIII collagen, unlike CHO-alpha2beta1 cells. Integrins alpha(1)beta(1) and alpha(2)beta(1) recognize collagens with the specific alphaI domains. The alpha(1)I and alpha(2)I domains were produced as recombinant proteins, labeled with europium and used in a sensitive solid-phase binding assay based on time-resolved fluorescence. alpha(1)I domain, unlike the alpha(2)I domain, could attach to type XIII collagen. The results indicate, that alpha(1)beta(1) and alpha(2)beta(1) have different ligand binding specificity. Distinct recognition of different collagen subtypes by the alphaI domains can partially explain the differences seen in cell spreading. However, despite the fact that CHO-alpha1beta1 cells could not spread on type II collagen alpha(1)I domain could bind to this collagen type. Thus, the cell spreading on collagens may also be regulated by factors other than the integrins.',\n",

Expression of ALK1 in blood vessels and mutations of the ALK1 gene in human type II hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients suggest that ALK1 may have an important role during vascular development. To define the function of ALK1 during development, we inactivated the ALK1 gene in mice by gene targeting. The ALK1 homozygous embryos die at midgestation, exhibiting severe vascular abnormalities characterized by excessive fusion of capillary plexes into cavernous vessels and hyperdilation of large vessels. These vascular defects are associated with enhanced expression of angiogenic factors and proteases and are characterized by deficient differentiation and recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells. The blood vessel defects in ALK1-deficient mice are reminiscent of mice lacking TGF-beta1, TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaR-II), or endoglin, suggesting that ALK1 may mediate TGF-beta1 signal in endothelial cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that ALK1 in endothelial cells binds to TGF-beta1 and TbetaR-II. Furthermore, the ALK1 signaling pathway can inhibit TGF-beta1-dependent transcriptional activation mediated by the known TGF-beta1 type I receptor, ALK5. Taken together, our results suggest that the balance between the ALK1 and ALK5 signaling pathways in endothelial cells plays a crucial role in determining vascular endothelial properties during angiogenesis.',\n",

DC-SIGN, which is abundantly expressed by DC both in vitro and in vivo, mediates transient adhesion with T cells.

NK cell differentiation is accompanied by the cell surface expression of a mucin-like glycoprotein bearing an NK cell-restricted keratan sulfate-related lactosamine carbohydrate, the PEN5 epitope. Here, we report that PEN5 is a post-translational modification of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). The PEN5 epitope creates on PSGL-1 a unique binding site for L-selectin, which is independent of PSGL-1 tyrosine sulfation. On the surface of NK cells, the expression of PEN5 is coordinated with the disappearance of L-selectin and the up-regulation of Killer cell Ig-like Receptors (KIR).

Stimulation of L1.2/hGPR2 transfectants with hESkine induced their migration and resulted in intracellular calcium mobilization. These results provide evidence that GPR2 is a specific receptor for ESkine. We propose that GPR2 be renamed as CCR10.

Because of the skin-associated expression pattern of CCL27, we focused on the expression of CCL27 and CCR10 in normal skin compared with inflammatory and autoimmune skin diseases. CCL27 is constitutively produced by keratinocytes but can also be induced upon stimulation with TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. CCR10 is not expressed by keratinocytes and is instead expressed by melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and dermal microvascular endothelial cells. CCR10 was also detected in T cells as well as in skin-derived Langerhans cells.

We report here on the characterization of a third human lysophosphatidic acid receptor subtype, Edg-7, which mediates lysophosphatidic acid-evoked calcium mobilization. In a rat hepatoma Rh7777 cell line that lacks endogenous responses to lysophosphatidic acid, this lipid mediator, but not others, evokes calcium transients when the cells have been transfected with Edg-7 or Edg-4 DNAs. Furthermore, frog oocytes exhibit a calcium-mediated chloride conductance in response to mammalian-selective lysophosphatidic acid mimetics after injection of Edg-7 mRNA. Edg-7-expressing Rh7777 cells do not show inhibition of forskolin-driven rises in cAMP in response to lysophosphatidic acid. However, membranes from HEK293T cells cotransfected with Edg-7 and G(i2)alpha protein DNAs show lysophosphatidic acid dose-dependent increases in [gamma-(35)S]GTP binding with an EC(50) value of 195 nM. When we used this assay to compare various synthetic LPA analogs at Edg-2, Edg-4, and Edg-7 receptors, we found that ethanolamine-based compounds, which are full LPA mimetics at Edg-2 and Edg-4, exhibit little activity at the Edg-7 receptor. Edg-7 RNA was detected in extracts of several rat and human tissues including prostate.

Human primary osteoblasts were found to express syndecan-2 and -4 but few syndecan-1 transcripts and proteins. Recombinant human GM-CSF coupled to biotin was found to bind to syndecan-2. Immunocytochemical transmission electron microscope analysis showed co-localization of syndecan-2 and GM-CSF at the cell membrane surface. Syndecan-2 also co-localized at the cell surface and co-immunoprecipitated with the GM-CSF receptor alpha chain, suggesting a strong interaction between the cytokine, its receptor, and syndecan-2. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in syndecan-2 associated with the alpha chain of the GM-CSF receptor was increased after cell stimulation by GM-CSF. Antisense oligonucleotides that reduced specifically the expression of syndecan-2 inhibited the mitogenic activity of GM-CSF and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 induced by the cytokine.

Binding studies with radiolabeled MCP-4 demonstrated a single high affinity binding site with an IC(50) of 0.14 nM. As shown by competition binding, other members of the MCP family also recognized this receptor. MCP-2 was the next most potent ligand, with an IC(50) of 0.45 nM. Surprisingly, eotaxin (IC(50) = 6.7 nM) and MCP-3 (IC(50) = 4.1 nM) bind with greater affinity than MCP-1 (IC(50) = 10.7 nM) but only act as agonists in chemotaxis assays at 100-fold higher concentrations. Because of high affinity binding and functional chemotactic responses, we have termed this receptor CCR11. The gene for CCR11 was localized to human chromosome 3q22, which is distinct from most CC chemokine receptor genes at 3p21. Northern blot hybridization was used to identify CCR11 expression in heart, small intestine, and lung.

Protein constructs containing the first immunoglobulin domain of ICAM-5 were able to support CD11a/CD18 interaction, while deletion of the first domain abolished binding. Monoclonal antibodies reacting with the first domain of ICAM-5 also completely blocked the interaction. The soluble first domain of ICAM-5 inhibited the binding of T cells to immobilized ICAM-5 at concentrations of 50 nM and higher. Interestingly, the sixth domain of ICAM-5 was also able to support leukocyte binding, but this binding activity may not involve leukocyte integrins. To test the involvement of ICAM-5 in leukocyte-neuron interactions, an assay using human T cells binding to rat hippocampal neurons was established. This binding was blocked by monoclonal antibodies against CD11a/CD18 and ICAM-5. Thus ICAM-5 may act as a major adhesion molecule for leukocyte binding to neurons in the central nervous system.',\n",

Inhibins also bind type II activin receptors but do not recruit ALK4, providing a competitive model for the antagonism of activin by inhibin. Inhibins fail to antagonize activin in some tissues and cells, however, suggesting that additional components are required for inhibin action. Here we show that the type III TGF-beta receptor, betaglycan, can function as an inhibin co-receptor with ActRII. Betaglycan binds inhibin with high affinity and enhances binding in cells co-expressing ActRII and betaglycan. Inhibin also forms crosslinked complexes with both recombinant and endogenously expressed betaglycan and ActRII. Finally, betaglycan confers inhibin sensitivity to cell lines that otherwise respond poorly to this hormone. The ability of betaglycan to facilitate inhibin antagonism of activin provides a variation on the emerging roles of proteoglycans as co-receptors modulating ligand-receptor sensitivity, selectivity and function.',\n",

Thus, it is generally believed that the NPXY sequences function as endocytosis signals for all the LDL receptor family members. The primary aim of this study is to define the endocytosis signal(s) within the cytoplasmic tail of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP). By using LRP minireceptors, which mimic the function and trafficking of full-length endogenous LRP, we demonstrate that the YXXL motif, but not the two NPXY motifs, serves as the dominant signal for LRP endocytosis. We also found that the distal di-leucine motif within the LRP tail contributes to its endocytosis, and its function is independent of the YXXL motif. Although the proximal NPXY motif and the proximal di-leucine motif each play a limited role in LRP endocytosis in the context of the full-length tail, these motifs were functional within the truncated receptor tail.

In immunocytochemistry, GPI-ACE showed patchy, uneven distribution on the plasma membrane that was restored by filipin. Thus, ACE inhibitors were inactive as long as GPI-ACE was sequestered in cholesterol-rich membrane domains.

To understand this up-regulation mechanism, we studied essential regions of both CD9 and proHB-EGF for up-regulation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that not only CD9 but also other TM4 proteins including CD63, CD81, and CD82 associate with proHB-EGF on the cell surface. However, these TM4 proteins did not up-regulate DT binding activity of proHB-EGF. Transfection of a series of chimeric constructs comprising CD9 and CD81 showed that the major extracellular domain of CD9 is essential for up-regulation. Assays of DT binding activity and juxtacrine mitogenic activity of the deletion mutants of proHB-EGF and chimeric molecules, derived from proHB-EGF and TGF-alpha, showed that the essential domain of proHB-EGF for up-regulation is the EGF-like domain.

Fgf8 is thought to mediate this organizer function. In addition to Fgf8, Fgf17 and Fgf18 are also expressed in the MHB junction. Fgf17 is expressed later and broader than either Fgf8 or Fgf18. Disrupting the Fgf17 gene in the mouse decreased precursor cell proliferation in the medial cerebellar (vermis) anlage after E11.5. Loss of an additional copy of Fgf8 enhanced the phenotype and accelerated its onset, demonstrating that both molecules cooperate to regulate the size of the precursor pool of cells that develop into the cerebellar vermis. However, expression patterns of Wnt1, En2, Pax5 and Otx2 were not altered suggesting that specification and patterning of MHB tissue was not perturbed and that these FGFs are not required to pattern the vermis at this stage of development. The consequence of this developmental defect is a progressive, dose-dependent loss of the most anterior lobe of the vermis in mice lacking Fgf17 and in mice lacking Fgf17 and one copy of Fgf8. Significantly, the differentiation of anterior vermis neuroepithelium was shifted rostrally and medially demonstrating that FGF also regulates the polarized progression of differentiation in the vermis anlage. Finally, this developmental defect results in an ataxic gait in some mice.',\n",

We now report the presence and biological activity of endothelin (ET)-1 in this GnRH-secreting neuronal cell. By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we found gene and protein expression of ET-1 and its converting enzyme ECE-1 in both fetal olfactory mucosa and FNC-B4 cells. The presence of authentic ET-1 in the conditioned media of FNC-B4 cells was further supported by combined RIAs and high-performance liquid chromatography studies. Experiments with radiolabeled ET-1 and ET-3 strongly indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites, corresponding to the ETA (16,500 sites/cell) and the ETB receptors (8,700 sites/cell). Functional studies, using selective analogs, indicated that these two classes of receptors subserve distinct functions in human GnRH-secreting cells. The ETA receptor subtype mediated an increase in intracellular calcium and GnRH secretion. Conversely, stimulation of the ETB subtype induced DNA synthesis and mitogen-activated protein kinase p44ERK1 expression. This is the first demonstration, in a human in vitro model, of a neuroendocrine role for ET-1 as regulator of GnRH-secreting neuron activity.',\n",
       " '10770925': 'Monocyte chemoattracant-1 (MCP-1) stimulates leukocyte chemotaxis to inflammatory sites, such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and asthma, by use of the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2, a member of the G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor superfamily. These studies identified a family of antagonists, spiropiperidines. One of the more potent compounds blocks MCP-1 binding to CCR2 with a K(d) of 60 nm, but it is unable to block binding to CXCR1, CCR1, or CCR3. These compounds were effective inhibitors of chemotaxis toward MCP-1 but were very poor inhibitors of CCR1-mediated chemotaxis. The compounds are effective blockers of MCP-1-driven inhibition of adenylate cyclase and MCP-1- and MCP-3-driven cytosolic calcium influx; the compounds are not agonists for these pathways. We showed that glutamate 291 (Glu(291)) of CCR2 is a critical residue for high affinity binding and that this residue contributes little to MCP-1 binding to CCR2. The basic nitrogen present in the spiropiperidine compounds may be the interaction partner for Glu(291), because the basicity of this nitrogen was essential for affinity; furthermore, a different class of antagonists, a class that does not have a basic nitrogen (2-carboxypyrroles), were not affected by mutations of Glu(291). In addition to the CCR2 receptor, spiropiperidine compounds have affinity for several biogenic amine receptors. Receptor models indicate that the acidic residue, Glu(291), from transmembrane-7 of CCR2 is in a position similar to the acidic residue contributed from transmembrane-3 of biogenic amine receptors, which may account for the shared affinity of spiropiperidines for these two receptor classes. The models suggest that the acid-base pair, Glu(291) to piperidine nitrogen, anchors the spiropiperidine compound within the transmembrane ovoid bundle. This binding site may overlap with the space required by MCP-1 during binding and signaling; thus the small molecule ligands act as antagonists. An acidic residue in transmembrane region 7 is found in most chemokine receptors and is rare in other serpentine receptors. The model of the binding site may suggest ways to make new small molecule chemokine receptor antagonists, and it may rationalize the design of more potent and selective antagonists.',\n",
       " '10772816': 'The present study provides direct evidence that syndecan 2 participates selectively in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1 through specific binding of its heparan sulfate side chains to the fibronectin substrate. Our previous study with Lewis lung carcinoma-derived P29 cells demonstrated that the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which binds to fibronectin, is syndecan 2 (N. Itano et al., 1996, Biochem. J. 315, 925-930). We here report that in vitro treatment of the cells by antisense oligonucleotide for syndecan 2 resulted in a failure to form stress fibers on fibronectin substrate in association with specific suppression of its cell surface expression. Instead, localization of actin filaments in the cytoplasmic cortex occurred. A similar response of the cells was observed when the cells were treated to eliminate functions of cell surface heparan sulfates, including exogenous addition of heparin and pretreatment with anti-heparan sulfate antibody, F58-10E4, and with proteinase-free heparitinase I. Size- and structure-defined oligosaccharides prepared from heparin and chemically modified heparins were utilized as competitive inhibitors to examine the structural characteristics of the cell surface heparan sulfates involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Their affinity chromatography on a column linked with a recombinant H-271 peptide containing a C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin demonstrated that 2-O-sulfated iduronates were essential for the binding. Inhibition studies revealed that a heparin-derived dodecasaccharide sample enriched with an IdoA(2OS)-GlcNS(6OS) disaccharide completely blocked binding of the syndecan 2 ectodomain to immobilized H-271 peptide. Finally, the dodecasaccharide sample was shown to inhibit stress fiber formation, triggered by adhesion of P29 cells to a CH-271 polypeptide consisting of both the RGD cell-binding and the C-terminal heparin-binding domains of fibronectin in a fused form. All these results consistently suggest that syndecan 2 proteoglycan interacts with the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin at the highly sulfated cluster(s), such as [IdoA(2OS)-GlcNS(6OS)](6) present in its heparan sulfate chains, to result in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1.',\n",

In this study, we have used synthetic peptides representing these various sequences in order to identify the cellular receptor and TSP domain responsible for stimulation of resorption. We show that one peptide CSVTCG, which represents the CD36-binding region of TSP-1, stimulates resorption in a fashion similar to the intact molecule, while the peptides RGDS, RFYVVMWK, and RFYVVM, representing other cell-binding domains of TSP, have no effect on resorption. Using RT-PCR and immunoblotting, we further demonstrate expression of CD36 in human osteoclastoma (giant cell tumour), primary human bone derived cells, and clonal osteoblastic cells. These studies suggest that CD36 is involved in regulation of resorption by osteoclasts and is the receptor responsible for the resorption-promoting effects of TSP-1.',\n",

When apelin-36 and its pyroglutamylated C-terminal peptide, [<Glu(65)]apelin-13, were compared in microphysiometric analyses, the elevation of extracellular acidification induced in cells expressing APJ by [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 was transient, whereas that by apelin-36 was sustained. These responses were almost completely inhibited by a specific inhibitor for G(i) or that for Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. (125)I -Labeled [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 analogue specifically bound to APJ with a high affinity, and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 was more potent than apelin-36 in competitive inhibition assays. Because pretreatment with apelin-36 but not [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 drastically reduced the binding of the labeled apelin to APJ, the different patterns of acidification induced by these two peptides appeared to reflect their dissociation rather than association with APJ. Apelin elicited the migration of APJ-expressing cells, and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 was more potent than apelin-36 in this activity. Heterogeneous molecular forms of apelin corresponding to apelin-36 and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 were produced in bovine colostrum.

In the present study, we demonstrate that, upon ligand binding and incubation at 37 degrees C, the EGFR was polyubiquitinated regardless of overexpression of mutant dynamin. In cells not overexpressing mutant dynamin, the EGFR was rapidly internalized and deubiquitinated. In cells being endocytosis-deficient, due to overexpression of mutant dynamin, however, the EGFR was upon prolonged chase first found in deeply invaginated coated pits, and then eventually moved out of the coated pits and back onto the smooth plasma membrane. Polyubiquitination occurred equally efficiently in cells with or without intact clathrin-dependent endocytosis, while the kinetics of ubiquitination and deubiquitination was somewhat different. We further found that the EGF-induced ubiquitination of Eps15 occurred both in the absence and presence of endocytosis with the same kinetics as polyubiquitination of the EGFR, but that the EGF-induced monoubiquitination of Eps15 was somewhat reduced upon overexpression of mutant dynamin. Our data show that EGF-induced polyubiquitination of the EGFR occurs at the plasma membrane.',\n",

One mutant of LIGHT exhibits selective binding to HveA and is inactive triggering cell death in HT29.14s cells or induction of ICAM-1 in fibroblasts. Studies with HveA- or LTbetaR-specific antibodies further indicated that HveA does not contribute, either cooperatively or by direct signaling, to the death pathway activated by LIGHT. LTbetaR, not HveA, recruits TNF receptor-associated factor-3 (TRAF3), and LIGHT-induced death is blocked by a dominant negative TRAF3 mutant. Together, these results indicate that TRAF3 recruitment propagates death signals initiated by LIGHT-LTbetaR interaction and implicates a distinct biological role for LIGHT-HveA system.',\n",

The data show that substituting residues at 14 positions out of 28 in VIP resulted in a >10-fold increase of K(i) or EC(50) at the VPAC(1) receptor. Modeling of the three-dimensional structure of native VIP (central alpha-helice from Val(5) to Asn(24) with random coiled N and C terminus) and analogs shows that substitutions of His(1), Val(5), Arg(14), Lys(15), Lys(21), Leu(23), and Ile(26) decreased biological activity without altering the predicted structure, supporting that those residues directly interact with VPAC(1) receptor. The interaction of the analogs with human VPAC(2) receptor is similar to that observed with VPAC(1) receptor, with three remarkable exceptions: substitution of Thr(11) and Asn(28) by alanine increased K(i) for binding to VPAC(2) receptor; substitution of Tyr(22) by alanine increased EC(50) for stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity through interaction with the VPAC(2) receptor. By combining 3 mutations at positions 11, 22, and 28, we developed the [Ala(11,22,28)]VIP analog which constitutes the first highly selective (>1,000-fold) human VPAC(1) receptor agonist derived from VIP ever described.',\n",

However, the molecular identity of this myocardial PLD and the mechanisms that regulate it are not well understood. Using subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis, we found that PLD2 is the major myocardial PLD and that it localizes primarily to sarcolemmal membranes. A 100-kDa PLD2-interacting cardiac protein was detected using a protein overlay assay employing purified PLD2 and then identified as alpha-actinin using peptide-mass fingerprinting with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy. The direct association between PLD2 and alpha-actinin was confirmed using an in vitro binding assay and localized to PLD2's N-terminal 185 amino acids. Purified alpha-actinin potently inhibits PLD2 activity (IC(50) = 80 nm) in an interaction-dependent and ADP-ribosylation factor-reversible manner. Finally, alpha-actinin co-localizes with actin and with PLD2 in the detergent-insoluble fraction from sarcolemmal membranes.

The biochemical mechanism leading to this clinical observation is unknown. We have previously reported high molecular weight kininogen (HK) inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by binding to the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex. Although factor XII will bind to the intact platelet through GP Ibalpha (glycocalicin) without activation, we now report that factor XIIa (0. 37 microm), but not factor XII zymogen, is required for the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XIIa had no significant effect on SFLLRN-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover, an antibody to the thrombin site on protease-activated receptor-1 failed to block factor XII binding to platelets. Inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was demonstrated with factor XIIa but not with factor XII zymogen or factor XIIf, indicating that the conformational exposure of the heavy chain following proteolytic activation is required for inhibition. However, inactivation of the catalytic activity of factor XIIa did not affect the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XII showed displacement of biotin-labeled HK (30 nm) binding to gel-filtered platelets and, at concentrations of 50 nm, was able to block 50% of the HK binding, suggesting involvement of the GP Ib complex. Antibodies to GP Ib and GP IX, which inhibited HK binding to platelets, did not block factor XII binding. However, using a biosensor, which monitors protein-protein interactions, both HK and factor XII bind to GP Ibalpha. Factor XII may serve to regulate thrombin binding to the GP Ib receptor by co-localizing with HK, to control the extent of platelet aggregation in vivo.',\n",

Flow cytometric analysis using a monoclonal antibody suggested that the protein is expressed on the surface of macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells; this antibody, like phosphatidylserine liposomes, inhibited the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and, in macrophages, induced an anti-inflammatory state.

CNTF stimulates gene expression, cell survival or differentiation in a variety of neuronal cell types such as sensory, sympathetic, ciliary and motor neurons. In addition, effects of CNTF on oligodendrocytes as well as denervated and intact skeletal muscle have been documented. CNTF itself lacks a classical signal peptide sequence of a secreted protein, but is thought to convey its cytoprotective effects after release from adult glial cells by some mechanism induced by injury. Interestingly, mice that are homozygous for an inactivated CNTF gene develop normally and initially thrive. Only later in adulthood do they exhibit a mild loss of motor neurons with resulting muscle weakness, leading to the suggestion that CNTF is not essential for neural development, but instead acts in response to injury or other stresses. The CNTF receptor complex is most closely related to, and shares subunits with the receptor complexes for interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor. The specificity conferring alpha subunit of the CNTF complex (CNTFR alpha), is extremely well conserved across species, and has a distribution localized predominantly to the nervous system and skeletal muscle. CNTFR alpha lacks a conventional transmembrane domain and is thought to be anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. Mice lacking CNTFR alpha die perinatally, perhaps indicating the existence of a second developmentally important CNTF-like ligand. Signal transduction by CNTF requires that it bind first to CNTFR alpha, permitting the recruitment of gp130 and LIFR beta, forming a tripartite receptor complex. CNTF-induced heterodimerization of the beta receptor subunits leads to tyrosine phosphorylation (through constitutively associated JAKs), and the activated receptor provides docking sites for SH2-containing signaling molecules, such as STAT proteins. Activated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to bind specific DNA sequences, resulting in enhanced transcription of responsive genes. The neuroprotective effects of CNTF have been demonstrated in a number of in vitro cell models as well as in vivo in mutant mouse strains which exhibit motor neuron degeneration. Intracerebral administration of CNTF and CNTF analogs has also been shown to protect striatal output neurons in rodent and primate models of Huntington's disease. Treatment of humans and animals with CNTF is also known to induce weight loss characterized by a preferential loss of body fat. When administered systemically, CNTF activates downstream signaling molecules such as STAT-3 in areas of the hypothalamus which regulate food intake. In addition to its neuronal actions, CNTF and analogs have been shown to act on non-neuronal cells such as glia, hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, embryonic stem cells and bone marrow stromal cells.\",\n",

       " '10816663': 'The CRF receptors belong to the VIP/GRF/PTH family of G-protein coupled receptors whose actions are mediated through activation of adenylate cyclase. Two CRF receptors, encoded by distinct genes, CRF-R1 and CRF-R2, and that can exist in two alternatively spliced forms, have been cloned. The type-1 receptor is expressed in many areas of the rodent brain, as well as in the pituitary, gonads, and skin. In the rodent, one splice variant of the type-2 receptor, CRF-R2 alpha, is expressed mainly in the brain, whereas the other variant, CRF-R2 beta, is found not only in the CNS, but also in cardiac and skeletal muscle, epididymis, and the gastrointestinal tract. The poor correlation between the sites of expression of CRF-R2 and CRF, as well as the relatively low affinity of CRF for CRF-R2, suggested the presence of another ligand, whose existence was confirmed in our cloning of urocortin. This CRF-like peptide is found not only in brain, but also in peripheral sites, such as lymphocytes. The broad tissue distribution of CRF receptors and their ligands underscores the important role of this system in maintenance of homeostasis. Functional studies of the two receptor types reveal differences in the specificity for CRF and related ligands. On the basis of its greater affinity for urocortin, in comparison with CRF, as well as its brain distribution, CRF-R2 may be the cognate receptor for urocortin. Mutagenesis studies of CRF receptors directed toward understanding the basis for their specificity, provide insight into the structural determinants for hormone-receptor recognition and signal transduction.',\n",

We previously demonstrated that gp17 binds to CD4 with high affinity and strongly inhibits T lymphocyte apoptosis induced by sequential cross-linking of CD4 and T cell receptor (TCR). To further characterize the gp17/CD4 interaction and map the gp17 binding site, we produced a secreted form of recombinant gp17 fused to human IgG1 Fc, gp17-Ig. We showed that gp17-Ig exhibits a binding affinity for CD4 similar to that of native gp17. As no information about gp17 structure is presently available, 99 overlapping gp17 peptides were synthesized by the Spot method, which allowed the mapping of two CD4 binding regions. Alanine scanning of CD4-reactive peptides identified critical residues, selected for site-directed mutagenesis. Nine gp17-Ig mutants were generated and characterized. Three residues within the carboxy-terminal region were identified as the major binding domain to CD4. The Spot method combined with mutagenesis represents a refined approach to distinguish the contact residues from the ones contributing to the conformation of the CD4-binding domain.',\n",

This report describes the use of transfectants expressing recombinant chimeric proteins, comprising the extracellular portions of KIR molecules and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tails of CD3-zeta, to create an in vitro system in which signaling is readily measured and that preserves the specificity of the KIR / HLA-C interaction. The identity of the amino acid residues on the KIR molecule important for binding to the HLA protein is not well understood; although some KIR2D residues involved in HLA-C recognition have been identified, their relative importance and whether other amino acids contribute to binding was unclear. This novel system was used to study, by site-directed mutagenesis, the role of various amino acids in KIR binding to HLA-C ligand. The data presented here show that while multiple polymorphic residues contribute to the HLA-C binding site on KIR proteins, two clusters of polymorphic residues define the group allotype specificity of HLA-C binding to a KIR2D molecule.',\n",

Meltrin gamma (ADAM-9) is a widely expressed member of this family and is involved in the shedding of heparin binding epidermal growth factor. Here we report that meltrin gamma can function as a cell adhesion molecule via its disintegrin domain. Using solid-phase binding assays and antibody inhibition experiments, we demonstrate that a murine meltrin gamma-Fc (Mel gamma -Fc) fusion protein binds to the integrin alpha(6)beta(1) on the surface of fibroblast cell lines, HT1080 and Wehi 164 in a specific manner. Since alpha(6)beta(1) is important for the motility of several cell types on laminin, cell migration studies using time-lapse video microscopy were performed. Cells adhering to Mel gamma-Fc displayed a rounded morphology and a marked increase (eight- to tenfold) in their motility compared to that on laminin. Furthermore, the p160 ROCK kinase inhibitor Y-27632 specifically reduced the migration of cells on meltrin gamma but had no effect on migration of cells on laminin, whilst the general tyrosine phoshorylation inhibitor, genistein, inhibited cell migration on both substrates. These results together suggest that meltrin gamma may play a role in regulating the motility of cells by binding to alpha(6)beta(1) integrin and this may be important during a variety of biological and pathological processes.',\n",

We performed a detailed analysis of the binding of GDNF and neurturin to their receptors and investigated the influence of cRET on the binding affinities. We show that the rate of dissociation of (125)I-GDNF from GFRalpha1 is increased in the presence of 50 nm GDNF, an effect that can be explained by the occurrence of negative cooperativity. Scatchard plots of the ligand concentration binding isotherms reveal a pronounced downward curvature at low (125)I-GDNF concentrations suggesting the presence of positive cooperativity. This effect is observed in the range of GDNF concentrations responsible for biological activity (1-20 pm) and may have an important role in cRET-independent signaling. A high affinity site with a K(D) of 11 pm for (125)I-GDNF is detected only when GFRalpha1 is co-expressed with cRET at a DNA ratio of 1:3. These results suggest an interaction of GFRalpha1 and cRET in the absence of GDNF and demonstrate that the high affinity binding can be measured only when cRET is present.',\n",
       " '10835423': 'The alpha(v)beta(3) integrin has been shown to bind several ligands, including osteopontin and vitronectin. Its role in modulating cell migration and downstream signaling pathways in response to specific extracellular matrix ligands has been investigated in this study. Highly invasive prostate cancer PC3 cells that constitutively express alpha(v)beta(3) adhere and migrate on osteopontin and vitronectin in an alpha(v)beta(3)-dependent manner. However, exogenous expression of alpha(v)beta(3) in noninvasive prostate cancer LNCaP (beta(3)-LNCaP) cells mediates adhesion and migration on vitronectin but not on osteopontin. Activation of alpha(v)beta(3) by epidermal growth factor stimulation is required to mediate adhesion to osteopontin but is not sufficient to support migration on this substrate. We show that alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated cell migration requires activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) pathway since wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, prevents PC3 cell migration on both osteopontin and vitronectin; furthermore, alpha(v)beta(3) engagement by osteopontin and vitronectin activates the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway. Migration of beta(3)-LNCaP cells on vitronectin also occurs through activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway; however, AKT phosphorylation is not increased upon engagement by osteopontin. Furthermore, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), known to support cell migration in beta(3)-LNCaP cells, is detected on both substrates. Thus, in PC3 cells, alpha(v)beta(3) mediates cell migration and PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation on vitronectin and osteopontin; in beta(3)-LNCaP cells, alpha(v)beta(3) mediates cell migration and PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation on vitronectin, whereas adhesion to osteopontin does not support alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated cell migration and PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation. We conclude therefore that alpha(v)beta(3) exists in multiple functional states that can bind either selectively vitronectin or both vitronectin and osteopontin and that can differentially activate cell migration and intracellular signaling pathways in a ligand-specific manner.',\n",

Although both alpha(E)beta(7) and alpha(4)beta(7) utilize the beta(7) chain, they have distinct binding specificities for E-cadherin and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), respectively. We found that mutation of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in the alpha(E) A-domain (D190A) abolished E-cadherin binding, as did mutation F298A on the A-domain surface near the MIDAS cleft. A docking model of the A-domain with E-cadherin domain 1 indicates that coordination of the alpha(E) MIDAS metal ion by E-cadherin Glu(31) and a novel projection of Phe(298) into a hydrophobic pocket on E-cadherin provide the basis for the interaction. The location of the binding site on the alpha(E) A-domain resembles that on other integrins, but its structure appears distinctive and particularly adapted to recognize the tip of E-cadherin, a unique integrin ligand. Additionally, mutation of the beta(7) MIDAS motif (D140A) abolished alpha(E)beta(7) binding to E-cadherin and alpha(4)beta(7)-mediated adhesion to MAdCAM-1, and alpha(4) chain mutations that abrogated binding of alpha(4)beta(1) to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and fibronectin similarly reduced alpha(4)beta(7) interaction with MAdCAM-1.

Through these interactions, laminins critically contribute to cell differentiation, cell shape and movement, maintenance of tissue phenotypes, and promotion of tissue survival. Recent advances in the characterization of genetic disruptions in humans, mice, nematodes and flies have revealed developmental roles for the different laminin subunits in diverse cell types, affecting differentiation from blastocyst formation to the post-natal period.

Guanylins activate two receptors, GC-C and OK-GC, which are expressed in intestine and/or kidney. Elevation of cGMP in the intestine elicits an increase in electrolyte and water secretion. Activation of renal receptors by uroguanylin stimulates urine flow and excretion of sodium, chloride, and potassium. Intracellular cGMP pathways for guanylins include activation of PKG-II and/or indirect stimulation of PKA-II. The result is activation of CFTR and/or C1C-2 channel proteins to enhance the electrogenic secretion of chloride and bicarbonate. Similar cellular mechanisms may be involved in the renal responses to guanylin peptides. Uroguanylin serves as an intestinal natriuretic hormone in postprandial states, thus linking the digestive and renal organ systems in a novel endocrine axis. Therefore, uroguanylin participates in the complex physiological processes underlying the saliuresis that is elicited by a salty meal.',\n",

Based on studies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we postulated that CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) might be the receptor on the neutrophils for binding to HK/HKa. However, the direct interaction of HK/HKa and Mac-1 had not been demonstrated. We therefore transfected HEK 293 cells with human Mac-1. Cell binding assays using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled HKa showed increased binding to the Mac-1 transfected cells compared with the control transfected cells. The binding was specific because unlabeled HKa, Mac-1-specific antibody, and fibrinogen can inhibit the binding of biotin-HKa to Mac-1 transfected cells. HKa bound to Mac-1 transfected cells (20 000 molecules/cell) with a K(d) = 62 nmol/L. To demonstrate directly the formation of a complex between HKa and Mac-1, we examined the interaction of HKa and purified Mac-1 in a cell-free system using an IAsys resonant mirror optical biosensor. The association and dissociation rate constants (k(on) and k(off), respectively) were determined, and they yielded a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 3.2x10(-9) mol/L. The functional significance of direct interaction of HKa to Mac-1 was investigated by examining the effect of HKa on cellular adhesion to fibrinogen and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), molecules abundant in the injured vessel wall. HKa blocked the adhesion of Mac-1 transfected cells to fibrinogen and ICAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, HKa may interrupt Mac-1-mediated cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell adhesive interactions and may therefore influence the recruitment of circulating neutrophils/monocytes to sites of vessel injury.

To better define the basis of the ICAM-4/beta(2) integrin interaction, we have generated wild-type, domain-deleted and mutated recombinant chimeric ICAM-4-Fc proteins and analyzed their interaction in a cellular adhesion assay with LFA-1 and Mac-1 L-cell stable transfectants. We found that monoclonal antibodies against CD11a, CD11b, CD18, or LW(ab) block adhesion of transfectant L-cells to immobilized ICAM-4-Fc protein and that the ICAM-4/beta(2) integrin interaction was highly sensitive to the presence of the divalent cations Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). Deletion of individual Ig-domains D1 or D2 of the extracellular part of ICAM-4 showed that LFA-1 binds to the first Ig-like domain, whereas the Mac-1 binding site encompassed both the first and the second Ig-like domains. Based on the crystal structure of ICAM-2, we propose a model for the Ig-like domains D1 and D2 of ICAM-4. Accordingly, by site-directed mutagenesis of 22 amino acid positions spread out on all faces of the ICAM-4 molecule, we identified four exposed residues, Leu(80), Trp(93), and Arg(97) on the CFG face and Trp(77) on the E-F loop of domain D1 that may contact LFA-1 as part of the binding site. However, the single and double mutants R52E and T91Q on the CFG face of domain D1, which correspond to the key residues Glu(34) and Gln(73) for ICAM-1 binding to LFA-1, had no effect on LFA-1 binding. In contrast, all mutants on the CFG face of domain D1 and residues Glu(151) and Thr(154) in the C'-E loop of the domain D2 seem to play a dominant role in Mac-1 binding. These data suggest that the binding site for LFA-1 on ICAM-4 overlaps but is distinct from the Mac-1 binding site.\",\n",

Fibulin-2 has also been found to adhere to cells via beta3 integrins. We studied the association of fibulins with fibronectin in BM stroma. By confocal microscopy, fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 immunostainings were co-localized with fibronectin in the adherent layer of long-term BM cultures. In cell adhesion assays using recombinant proteins, mouse fibulin-2 adhered to human erythroid-megakaryocytic leukaemia cell line HEL. This adhesion was mediated by beta3 integrins. However, HEL cells did not adhere to human fibulin-2. We therefore studied a possible species-specific cell-adhesive activity of mouse fibulin-2 by using mouse megakaryocytes, obtained by culture of BM cells in the presence of thrombopoietin. These megakaryocytes did not adhere to mouse fibulin-2. Our findings suggested that the functional role of fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 in BM stroma is related to binding to the major cell adhesion protein fibronectin, whereas adhesion of mouse fibulin-2 to human cells containing the integrin beta3 chain is not related to an apparent physiological function of the protein.',\n",

The anti-opiate neuropeptides FF and AF (NPFF and NPAF) have been implicated in pain modulation as well as in opioid tolerance and may play a critical role in this process, although their mechanism of action has remained unknown. Here we describe a cDNA encoding a novel neuropeptide Y-like human orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), referred to as HLWAR77 for which NPAF and NPFF have high affinity. Cells transiently or stably expressing HLWAR77 bind and respond in a concentration-dependent manner to NPAF and NPFF and are also weakly activated by FMRF-amide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide) and a variety of related peptides. The high affinity and potency of human NPFF and human NPAF for HLWAR77 strongly suggest that these are the cognate ligands for this receptor. Expression of HLWAR77 was demonstrated in brain regions associated with opiate activity, consistent with the pain-modulating activity of these peptides, whereas the expression in adipose tissue suggests other physiological and pathophysiological activities for FMRF-amide neuropeptides. The discovery that the anti-opiate neuropeptides are the endogenous ligands for HLWAR77 will aid in defining the physiological role(s) of these ligands and facilitate the identification of receptor agonists and antagonists.',\n",

Here we demonstrate that galectin-8, a secreted mammalian (beta)-galactoside binding protein, inhibits adhesion of human carcinoma (1299) cells to plates coated with integrin ligands, and induces cell apoptosis. Pretreatment of the cells with Mn(2+), which increases the affinity of integrins for their ligands, abolished the inhibitory effects of galectin-8. The inhibitory effects of galectin-8 were specific and were not mimicked by plant lectins or other galectins (galectin-1 and galectin-3). In accordance with its anti-adhesive effects, transfection of galectin-8 cDNA into 1299 cells significantly reduced (by 75%) colony formation, when compared to the number of colonies formed by cells transfected with an empty vector. Affinity chromatography over immobilized galectin-8 indicated that few membrane proteins interacted with galectin-8 in a sugar-dependent manner. Microsequencing and western immunoblotting revealed that (alpha)(3)(beta)(1 )integrin derived from 1299 as well as other cells (e.g. HeLa and human endothelial cells) is a major galectin-8 binding-protein. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical studies suggested that endogenous galectin-8, secreted from 1299 cells, forms complexes with (alpha)(3)(beta)(1) integrins expressed on the surface of 1299 cells. Galectin-8 also interacts with other members of the integrin family, like (alpha)(6)(beta)(1 )integrins. In contrast, galectin-8 only minimally interacts with (alpha)(4 )or (beta)(3 )integrins. We propose that galectin-8 is an integrin binding-protein that interacts to a different extent with several, but not all members of the integrin family. Binding of galectin-8 modulates integrin interactions with the extracellular matrix and thus regulates cell adhesion and cell survival.',\n",

Each complex includes the common signal-transducing subunit gp130. OSM and LIF also recruit the signaling competent, but structurally distinct OSMRbeta and LIFRalpha subunits, respectively. To test the hypothesis that the particularly prominent cell regulation by OSM is due to signals contributed by OSMRbeta, we introduced stable expression of human or mouse OSMRbeta in rat hepatoma cells which have endogenous receptors for IL-6 and LIF, but not OSM. Both mouse and human OSM engaged gp130 with their respective OSMRbeta subunits, but only human OSM also acted through LIFR. Signaling by OSMRbeta-containing receptors was characterized by highest activation of STAT5 and ERK, recruitment of the insulin receptor substrate and Jun-N-terminal kinase pathways, and induction of a characteristic pattern of acute phase proteins. Since LIF together with LIFRalpha appear to form a more stable complex with gp130 than OSM with gp130 and OSMRbeta, co-activation of LIFR and OSMR resulted in a predominant LIF-like response. These results suggest that signaling by IL-6 cytokines is not identical, and that a hierarchical order of cytokine receptor action exists in which LIFR ranks as dominant member.',\n",

TIP39 does not appreciably activate the PTH1 receptor, but in this study it is shown to bind the receptor with moderate affinity (59 nm). In this study, we investigated the molecular determinants of both ligand and receptor for the PTH2 receptor selectivity of TIP39 and quantitatively evaluated the role of molecular elements in the binding of TIP39 to the PTH2 and PTH1 receptors. A chimeric receptor composed of the N-terminal extracellular domain of the PTH1 receptor and the remainder (juxtamembrane domain) of the PTH2 receptor (P2-NP1) was fully activated by TIP39 (E(max) = 98% of the rPTH-(1-34), E(max), EC(50) = 2.0 nm). This receptor chimera bound TIP39 with an equivalent affinity to the wild-type PTH2 receptor (2. 3 and 2.0 nm, respectively). The reciprocal chimeric receptor (P1-NP2) was not activated by TIP39 and bound the ligand with an affinity equivalent to that of the PTH1 receptor. Thus, the juxtamembrane receptor domain specifies the signaling and binding selectivity of TIP39 for the PTH2 receptor over the PTH1 receptor. Removing six N-terminal residues of TIP39 eliminated activation of the PTH2 receptor and reduced binding affinity 70-fold. In contrast, this truncation increased affinity for the PTH1 receptor 10-fold, reversing the PTH2/PTH1 receptor binding selectivity and resulting in a high affinity interaction of TIP-(7-39) with the PTH1 receptor (6 nm). These findings can be explained by a strong interaction between the N-terminal region of TIP39 and the juxtamembrane domain of the PTH2 receptor, with the corresponding domain of the PTH1 receptor acting as a selectivity barrier against high affinity binding of TIP39. As a result, TIP-(7-39) is a highly potent, selective antagonist for the PTH1 receptor.',\n",

UCB35625 also inhibited the CCR3-mediated entry of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 primary isolate 89.6 into the glial cell line, NP-2 (IC(50) = 57 nm). Chemotaxis of transfected cells expressing either CCR1 or CCR3 was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of the compound (IC(50) values of CCR1-MIP-1alpha = 9.6 nm, CCR3-eotaxin = 93.7 nm). However, competitive ligand binding assays on the same transfectants revealed that considerably larger concentrations of UCB35625 were needed for effective ligand displacement than were needed for the inhibition of receptor function. Thus, it appears that the compound may interact with a region present in both receptors that inhibits the conformational change necessary to initiate intracellular signaling. By virtue of its potency at the two major eosinophil chemokine receptors, UCB35625 is a prototypic therapy for the treatment of eosinophil-mediated inflammatory disorders, such as asthma and as an inhibitor of CCR3-mediated human immunodeficiency virus-1 entry.',\n",

Although JAM did not interact with the single PDZ domains of ZO-1 or of CASK, we found that a ZO-1 fragment containing PDZ domains 2 and 3 bound to JAM in vitro in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. AF-6 as well as ZO-1 could be coprecipitated with JAM from endothelial cell extracts, demonstrating the association of the endogenously expressed molecules in vivo. Targeting of JAM to sites of cell contacts could be affected by the loss of the PDZ domain-binding C terminus. Full-length mouse JAM co-distributed with endogenous AF-6 in human Caco-2 cells at sites of cell contact independent of whether adjacent cells expressed mouse JAM as an extracellular binding partner. In contrast, truncated JAM lacking the PDZ domain-binding C terminus did not co-distribute with endogenous AF-6, but was restricted to cell contacts between cells expressing mouse JAM. Our results suggest that JAM can be recruited to intercellular junctions by its interaction with the PDZ domain-containing proteins AF-6 and possibly ZO-1.',\n",

We describe the expression and functional analyses of frizzled 7 (Xfz7) during gastrulation in Xenopus. Low levels of Xfz7 transcripts are expressed maternally during cleavage stages; its zygotic expression strongly increases at the beginning of gastrulation and is predominantly localized to the presumptive neuroectoderm and deep cells of the involuting mesoderm. Overexpression of Xfz7 in the dorsal equatorial region affects the movements of convergent extension and delays mesodermal involution. It alters the correct localization, but not the expression, of mesodermal and neural markers. These effects can be rescued by extra-Xfz7, which is a secreted form of the receptor that also weakly inhibits convergent extension when overexpressed. This suggests that the wild-type and truncated receptors have opposing effects when coexpressed and that overexpression of Xfz7 causes an increased signalling activity. Consistent with this, Xfz7 biochemically and functionally interacts with Xwnt11. In addition, Dishevelled, but not (&bgr;)-catenin, synergizes with Xfz7 to affect convergent extension. Furthermore, overexpression of Xfz7 and Xwnt11 also affects convergent extension in activin-treated animal caps, and this can be efficiently reversed by coexpression of Cdc42(T17N), a dominant negative mutant of the small GTPase Cdc42 known as a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton. Conversely, Cdc42(G12V), a constitutively active mutant, rescues the effects of extra-Xfz7 on convergent extension in a dose-dependent manner. That both gain-of-function and loss-of-function of both frizzled and dishevelled produce the same phenotype has been well described in Drosophila tissue polarity. Therefore, our results suggest an endogenous role of Xfz7 in the regulation of convergent extension during gastrulation.',\n",

Here we have cloned a complementary DNA from human placental messenger RNA encoding a precursor protein of 121 amino acids which gives rise to a mature peptide identical to the neuropeptide neurokinin B (NKB) of other mammalian species. In female rats, concentrations of NKB several-fold above that of an animal 20 days into pregnancy caused substantial pressor activity. In human pregnancy, the expression of NKB was confined to the outer syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta, significant concentrations of NKB could be detected in plasma as early as week 9, and plasma concentrations of NKB were grossly elevated in pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. We conclude that elevated levels of NKB in early pregnancy may be an indicator of hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and that treatment with certain neurokinin receptor antagonists may be useful in alleviating the symptoms.',\n",

These structural similarities led us to hypothesize that both ligands could interact with the same binding pocket in the V1a receptor. To determine receptor residues responsible for discriminating binding of agonist and antagonist ligands, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of conserved aromatic and hydrophilic residues as well as nonconserved residues, all located in the transmembrane binding pocket of the V1a receptor. Mutation of aromatic residues of transmembrane region VI (W304, F307, F308) reduced affinity for the d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP and markedly decreased affinity for the unrelated strongly hydrophobic V1a-selective nonpeptide antagonist SR 49059. Replacement of these aromatic residues had no effect on AVP binding, but increased AVP-induced coupling efficacy of the receptor for its G protein. Mutating hydrophilic residues Q108, K128 and Q185 in transmembrane regions II, III and IV, respectively, led to a decrease in affinity for both agonists and antagonists. Finally, the nonconserved residues T333 and A334 in transmembrane region VII, controlled the V1a/V2 binding selectivity for both nonpeptide and cyclic peptide antagonists. Thus, because conserved aromatic residues of the V1a receptor binding pocket seem essential for antagonists and do not contribute at all to the binding of agonists, we propose that these residues differentiate agonist vs. antagonist ligand binding.',\n",

While moieties in the immunoglobulin-like domains of L1 have been implicated in both heterophilic and homophilic binding, the function of the fibronectin (FN)-like repeats remains largely unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that the third FN-like repeat of L1 (FN3) spontaneously homomultimerizes to form trimeric and higher order complexes. Remarkably, these complexes support direct RGD-independent interactions with several integrins, including alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(5)beta(1). A pep- tide derived from the putative C-C' loop of FN3 (GSQRKHSKRHIHKDHV(852)) also forms trimeric complexes and supports alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(5)beta(1) binding. Substitution of the dibasic RK(841) and KR(845) sequences within this peptide or the FN3 domain limited multimerization and abrogated integrin binding. Evidence is presented that the multimerization of, and integrin binding to, the FN3 domain is regulated both by conformational constraints imposed by other domains and by plasmin- mediated cleavage within the sequence RK( downward arrow)HSK( downward arrow)RH(846). The integrin alpha(9)beta(1), which also recognizes the FN3 domain, colocalizes with L1 in a manner restricted to sites of cell-cell contact. We propose that distal receptor ligation events at the cell-cell interface may induce a conformational change within the L1 ectodomain that culminates in receptor multimerization and integrin recruitment via interaction with the FN3 domain.\",\n",

No high affinity ligand has yet been reported for this receptor, although it has been reported to serve as a second component in IL-10 signaling. A new member of the interferon receptor family, which we term IL-22R, functions as a second component together with CRF2-4 to enable IL-22 signaling. IL-22 does not bind the IL-10R. Cell lines were identified that respond to IL-22 by activation of STATs 1, 3, and 5, but were unresponsive to IL-10.

Additionally, JAM was coprecipitated with ZO-1 in the detergent-insoluble fraction of Caco-2 epithelial cells. A putative PDZ-binding motif at the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of JAM was required for mediating the interaction of JAM with ZO-1, as assessed by in vitro binding and coprecipitation experiments. JAM was also coprecipitated with cingulin, another cytoplasmic component of tight junctions, and this association required the amino-terminal globular head of cingulin. Taken together, these data indicate that JAM is a component of the multiprotein complex of tight junctions, which may facilitate junction assembly.',\n",

The first binding site was identified by exploiting the different abilities of human IL-5Ralpha (hIL-5Ralpha) and mouse IL-5Ralpha (mIL-5Ralpha) to bind hIL-5. Here we show that ovine IL-5 (oIL-5) has the ability to activate the hIL-5Ralpha but not the mIL-5Ralpha. By using chimeras of the mIL-5Ralpha and hIL-5Ralpha we demonstrate that residues within the first and third FnIII-like domains of mIL-5Ralpha are responsible for this lack of activity. Furthermore, mutation of residues on hIL-5Ralpha to mIL-5Ralpha within the predicted DE and FG loop regions of the third FnIII domain reduces oIL-5 activity. These results show that regions of the third FnIII domain of IL-5Ralpha are involved in binding, in addition to the regions in domains one and two of the IL-5Ralpha that were identified in an earlier study.',\n",

The binding epitopes of BMP-2 for BMPR-IA (type I) and BMPR-II or ActR-II (type II) were characterized using BMP-2 mutant proteins for analysis of interactions with receptor ectodomains. A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity.

Here we show that an additional processing event occurs in the extracellular part of the receptor, preceding cleavage by the gamma-secretase-like activity. Purification of the activity accounting for this cleavage in vitro shows that it is due to TACE (TNFalpha-converting enzyme), a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain) family of metalloproteases.

Peptides derived from the unique N-terminal domain of annexin I serve as FPR ligands and trigger different signaling pathways in a dose-dependent manner. Lower peptide concentrations possibly found in inflammatory situations elicit Ca2+ transients without fully activating the MAP kinase pathway.

We found that neuromedin U specifically and clearly elevated the extracellular acidification rates, arachidonic acid metabolite release, and intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing TGR-1. Radiolabeled neuromedin U specifically bound with high affinity to membrane fractions prepared from these cells. These results show that TGR-1, like FM-3, is a specific and functional receptor for neuromedin U. We analyzed TGR-1 mRNA tissue distribution in rats using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and found it to considerably differ from that of FM-3 mRNA. TGR-1 mRNA was primarily expressed in the uterus, suggesting that TGR-1 mediates the contractile activity of neuromedin U in this tissue.

We previously proposed a nonproteolytic role for the uPA system in human myogenic cell differentiation in vitro, i.e., cell fusion, and showed that myogenic cells can use PAI-1 as an adhesion matrix molecule. The aim of this study was to define the role of the uPA system in myogenic cell migration that is necessary for fusion. Using a two-dimensional motility assay and microcinematography, we showed that any interference with the [uPAR:uPA:PAI-1] complex formation, and interference with LRP binding to this complex, markedly decreased myogenic cell motility. This phenomenon was reversible and independent of plasmin activity. Inhibition of cell motility was associated with suppression of both filopodia and membrane ruffling activity.

The functional heterologous assay system described is for the hEdg2 receptor, which uses lysophosphatidic acid as its endogenous ligand. Once activated, this receptor mediates its effects via multiple secondary messenger pathways, including a Gi-coupled pathway. We have transiently expressed a pertussis toxin-insensitive hEdg2 receptor-ratGialpha1 fusion protein into human embryonic kidney cells and have monitored the ability of compounds to stimulate [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in membranes prepared from these cells after pretreatment with toxin. Because the assay conditions used favor Gi-mediated responses and because endogenous Gialpha subunits are rendered inactive, the response measured is, by definition, fusion protein-mediated. Consequently, we have developed an assay that monitors definitively Edg2 receptor-mediated responses in a mammalian cell line.

To understand the structural basis for this interaction, we have solved the crystal structure of the human IgE-Fc-Fc epsilonRI alpha complex to 3.5-A resolution. The crystal structure reveals that one receptor binds one dimeric IgE-Fc molecule asymmetrically through interactions at two sites, each involving one C epsilon3 domain of the IgE-Fc. The interaction of one receptor with the IgE-Fc blocks the binding of a second receptor, and features of this interaction are conserved in other members of the Fc receptor family.

Results from molecular modeling suggest that the sequences involved in neurocan binding are localized on the surface of the first Ig domain and largely overlap with the G-F-C beta-strands proposed to interact with the fourth Ig domain during homophilic binding. This suggests that neurocan may sterically hinder a proper alignment of L1 domains.

Sema3A binds with high affinity to neuropilin-1 on growth cone filopodial tips. Although neuropilin-1 is required for Sema3A action, it is incapable of transmitting a Sema3A signal to the growth cone interior. Instead, the Sema3A/neuropilin-1 complex interacts with another transmembrane protein, plexin, on the surface of growth cones. Certain semaphorins, other than Sema3A, can bind directly to plexins. The intracellular domain of plexin is responsible for initiating the signal transduction cascade leading to growth cone collapse, axon repulsion, or growth cone turning. This intracellular cascade involves the monomeric G-protein, Rac1, and a family of neuronal proteins, the CRMPs. Rac1 is likely to be involved in semaphorin-induced rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, but how plexin controls Rac1 activity is not known. Vertebrate CRMPs are homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-33 protein, which is required for proper axon morphology in worms. CRMPs are essential for Sema3A-induced, neuropilin-plexin-mediated growth cone collapse, but the molecular interactions of growth cone CRMPs are not well defined.

The effect of Reelin on cortical neuronal migration in vitro and in vivo depends on interactions between Reelin and alpha3beta1 integrin. Absence of alpha3beta1 leads to a reduction of Dab1, a signaling protein acting downstream of Reelin. Thus, Reelin may arrest neuronal migration and promote normal cortical lamination by binding alpha3beta1 integrin and modulating integrin-mediated cellular adhesion.',\n",

Comparison of the primary sequence of ASP with the known MSH pharmacophore provides no suggestion about the putative bioactive domain(s) of ASP. To identify such bioactive motif(s), we synthesized 15-mer peptides that spanned the primary sequence of ASP and determined their effects on the melanogenic activities of murine melanocytes. Northern and Western blotting were used, together with chemical analysis of melanins and enzymatic assays, to identify three distinct bioactive regions of ASP that down-regulate eumelanogenesis. The decrease in eumelanin production was mediated by down-regulation of mRNA levels for tyrosinase and other melanogenic enzymes, as occurs in vivo, and these effects were comparable to those elicited by intact recombinant ASP. Shorter peptides in those motifs were synthesized and their effects on melanogenesis were further investigated. The amino acid arginine, which is present in the MSH peptide pharmacophore (HFRW), is also in the most active domain of ASP (KVARP). Our data suggest that lysines and an arginine (in motifs such as KxxxxKxxR or KxxRxxxxK) are important for the bioactivity of ASP. Identification of the specific ASP epitope that interacts with the MC1R has potential pharmacological applications in treating dysfunctions of skin pigmentation.',\n",
       " '10942781': 'The leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor and triggers a signaling pathway that leads to growth suppression. We find that decorin causes a functional inactivation of the oncogenic ErbB2 protein in breast carcinoma cells. Upon de novo expression of decorin, the ErbB2 protein is reduced by approximately 40%, whereas its degree of tyrosyl phosphorylation is almost completely abrogated. Both co-culture experiments or experiments with recombinant decorin demonstrate an initial induction of ErbB2 tyrosine kinase, followed by a profound and long-lasting down-regulation of its activity. This leads to growth inhibition and cytodifferentiation of mammary tumor cells and a concurrent suppression of their tumorigenic potential in vivo. These decorin-mediated effects appear to involve the activation of ErbB4, which in turn would block the phosphorylation of heterodimers containing either ErbB2 or ErbB3. These results provide an explanation for the heightened decorin levels around invasive carcinomas and suggest that decorin may function as a natural antagonist of neoplastic cells enriched in ErbB2.',\n",

The ADAM disintegrin domains generally lack RGD motifs, and their receptors are virtually unknown. Here we show that integrin alpha(9)beta(1) specifically interacts with the recombinant ADAMs-12 and -15 disintegrin domains in an RGD-independent manner. We also show that interaction between ADAM-12 or -15 and alpha(9)beta(1) supports cell-cell interaction. Interestingly, the cation requirement and integrin activation status required for alpha(9)beta(1)/ADAM-mediated cell adhesion and cell-cell interaction is similar to those required for known integrin-extracellular matrix interaction. These results are quite different from recent reports that ADAM-2/alpha(6)beta(1) interaction during sperm/egg fusion requires an integrin activation status distinct from that for extracellular matrix interaction. These results suggest that alpha(9)beta(1) may be a major receptor for ADAMs that lack RGD motifs, and that, considering a wide distribution of ADAMs and alpha(9)beta(1), this interaction may be of potential biological and pathological significance.',\n",

These cytokines drive the assembly of multisubunit receptor complexes, all of which contain at least one molecule of the transmembrane signaling receptor gp130. IL-11 has been shown to induce gp130-dependent signaling through the formation of a high affinity complex with the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) and gp130. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified three distinct receptor binding sites of IL-11, which enable it to form this high affinity receptor complex. Here we present data from immunoprecipitation experiments, using differentially tagged forms of ligand and soluble receptor components, which show that multiple copies of IL-11, IL-11R, and gp130 are present in the receptor complex. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that sites II and III of IL-11 are independent gp130 binding epitopes and that both are essential for gp130 dimerization. We also show that a stable high affinity complex of IL-11, IL-11R, and gp130 can be resolved by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its composition verified by second dimension denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results indicate that the three receptor binding sites of IL-11 and the Ig-like domain of gp130 are all essential for this stable receptor complex to be formed. We therefore propose that IL-11 forms a hexameric receptor complex composed of two molecules each of IL-11, IL-11R, and gp130.',\n",

Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.',\n",

The binding was mediated by the interaction of the chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain of versican with the carbohydrate-binding domain of L- and P-selectin and CD44. The binding of versican to L- and P-selectin was inhibited by CS B, CS E, and heparan sulfate (HS) but not by any other glycosaminoglycans tested. On the other hand, the binding to CD44 was inhibited by hyaluronic acid, chondroitin (CH), CS A, CS B, CS C, CS D, and CS E but not by HS or keratan sulfate. A cross-blocking study indicated that L- and P-selectin recognize close or overlapping sites on versican, whereas CD44 recognizes separate sites. We also show that soluble L- and P-selectin directly bind to immobilized CS B, CS E, and HS and that soluble CD44 directly binds to immobilized hyaluronic acid, CH, and all the CS chains examined. Consistent with these results, structural analysis showed that versican is modified with at least CS B and CS C. Thus, proteoglycans sufficiently modified with the appropriate glycosaminoglycans should be able to bind L-selectin, P-selectin, and/or CD44.',\n",

Furthermore, a TACI-Fc fusion protein recognizes both the cleaved, soluble form of BLyS as well as the membrane BLyS present on the cell surface of a recombinant cell line. TACI mRNA is found predominantly in B-cells and correlates with BLyS binding in a panel of B-cell lines. We also demonstrate that TACI interacts with nanomolar affinity with the BLyS-related tumor necrosis factor homologue APRIL for which no clear in vivo role has been described. BLyS and APRIL are capable of signaling through TACI to mediate NF-kappaB responses in HEK293 cells.

However, it has been less understood whether they are ligands for Notch receptors other than Notch1. Meanwhile, ligand-induced cleavage and nuclear translocation of the Notch protein are considered to be fundamental for Notch signaling, yet direct observation of the behavior of the Notch molecule after ligand binding, including cleavage and nuclear translocation, has been lacking. In this report, we investigated these issues for Notch2. All of the three DSL proteins bound to endogenous Notch2 on the surface of BaF3 cells, although characteristics of Jagged2 for binding to Notch2 apparently differed from that of Delta1 and Jagged1. After binding, the three DSL proteins induced cleavage of the membrane-spanning subunit of Notch2 (Notch2(TM)), which occurred within 15 min. In a simultaneous time course, the cleaved fragment of Notch2(TM) was translocated into the nucleus. Interestingly, the cleaved Notch2 fragment was hyperphosphorylated also in a time-dependent manner. Finally, binding of DSL proteins to Notch2 also activated the transcription of reporter genes driven by the RBP-Jkappa-responsive promoter. Together, these data indicate that all of these DSL proteins function as ligands for Notch2. Moreover, the findings of rapid cleavage, nuclear translocation, and phosphorylation of Notch2 after ligand binding facilitate the understanding of the Notch signaling.',\n",

Eph receptor binding triggered ephrin-A2 cleavage in a localized reaction specific to the cognate ligand. A cleavage-inhibiting mutation in ephrin-A2 delayed axon withdrawal. These studies reveal mechanisms for protease recognition and control of cell surface proteins, and, for ephrin-A2, they may provide a means for efficient axon detachment and termination of signaling.',\n",

In physiological conditions, the platelet plug limits blood loss. However, in pathologic conditions, such as rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, platelet-collagen interactions are associated with cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases. Platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) plays a crucial role in collagen-induced activation and aggregation of platelets, and people who are deficient in GPVI suffer from bleeding disorders. Based on the fact that GPVI is coupled to the Fc receptor (FcR)-gamma chain and thus should share homology with the FcR chains, the genes encoding human and mouse GPVI were identified. They belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and share 64% homology at the protein level. Functional evidence demonstrating the identity of the recombinant protein with GPVI was shown by binding to its natural ligand collagen; binding to convulxin (Cvx), a GPVI-specific ligand from snake venom; binding of anti-GPVI IgG isolated from a patient; and association to the FcR-gamma chain. The study also demonstrated that the soluble protein blocks Cvx and collagen-induced platelet aggregation and that GPVI expression is restricted to megakaryocytes and platelets. Finally, human GPVI was mapped to chromosome 19, long arm, region 1, band 3 (19q13), in the same region as multiple members of the Ig superfamily.

For the most reactive substrates, N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (N-t-Boc)-gamma-benzyl-Glu-Ala-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) and N-t-Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC, the K(m) values were determined to be 3. 81 and 4.89 microm, respectively. We further demonstrated that matriptase can convert hepatocyte growth factor/scattering factor to its active form, which can induce scatter of Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells and can activate c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation in A549 human lung carcinoma cells. In addition, we noted that matriptase can activate urokinase plasminogen activator but has no affect on plasminogen. These results suggest that matriptase could act as an epithelial, upstream membrane activator to recruit and activate stromal-derived downstream effectors important for extracellular matrix degradation and epithelial migration, two major events of tissue remodeling, cancer invasion, and metastasis.',\n",

In vitro, CIRL1 and CIRL2 interacted strongly with the PDZ domain of ProSAP1. The specificity of this interaction has been verified by in vivo experiments using solubilized rat brain membrane fractions and ProSAP1 antibodies; only CIRL1, but not CIRL2, was co-immunoprecipitated with ProSAP1. In situ hybridization revealed that ProSAP1 and CIRL1 are co-expressed in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Colocalization was also observed at the subcellular level, as both CIRL1 and ProSAP1 are enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction from rat brain. Expression of all three CIRL isoforms is highly regulated during postnatal brain development, with CIRL3 exhibiting its highest expression levels immediately after birth, followed by CIRL2 and finally CIRL1 in aged rats.',\n",

Striking phenotypic differences between CNTF- and CNTFR-deficient mice suggest that CNTFR serves as a receptor for a second, developmentally important ligand. We have identified this factor as a stable secreted complex of cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) and the soluble receptor cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF). CLF expression was required for CLC secretion, and the complex acted only on cells expressing functional CNTF receptors.

These binding interfaces also involve different hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic packing patterns compared to the structurally related human growth hormone (hGH)-receptor complexes. Additionally, the receptor-receptor interactions are different from those of the hGH-receptor complex.

They are also integral components of morphogenetic programs controlling the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of epithelia. Accumulated evidence indicates that the E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion system is highly regulated from inside the cells by a number of intracellular signaling pathways. Recently available information suggests that E-cadherins may also play a role in the transduction of signals from the outside of the cell to the cytoplasm. However, the nature of the biochemical routes regulated by E-cadherins is still largely unknown. In this study, we set out to explore the possibility that E-cadherins may regulate the activity of MAPK, a key signaling pathway involved in cell fate decisions, upon the formation of cell-cell contacts among neighboring cells. By using an immortalized non-tumorigenic keratinocyte cell line, HaCat, as a model system, we provide evidence that the assembly of calcium-dependent adherens junctions leads to a rapid and remarkable increase in the state of activation of MAPK and that this event is mediated by E-cadherins. Furthermore, we found that E-cadherins stimulate the MAPK pathway through the ligand-independent activation of epidermal growth factor receptors and the consequent activation of a biochemical route leading to the stimulation of MAPKs. These findings suggest that E-cadherins can initiate outside-in signal transducing pathways through the engagement of tyrosine kinase receptors for epidermal growth factor, thus providing a novel molecular mechanism whereby these cell adhesion molecules may ultimately control the fate of normal and transformed epithelial cells.',\n",

Thrombin selectively cleaves PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 to induce activation of platelets and vascular cells, while PAR2 is preferentially cleaved by trypsin. In pathological situations, other proteolytic enzymes may be generated in the circulation and could modify the responses of PARs by cleaving their extracellular domains. To assess the ability of such proteases to activate or inactivate PARs, we designed a strategy for locating cleavage sites on the exofacial NH(2)-terminal fragments of the receptors. The first extracellular segments of PAR1 (PAR1E) and PAR2 (PAR2E) expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli were incubated with a series of proteases likely to be encountered in the circulation during thrombosis or inflammation. Kinetic and dose-response studies were performed, and the cleavage products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Thrombin cleaved PAR1E at the Arg41-Ser42 activation site at concentrations known to induce cellular activation, supporting a native conformation of the recombinant polypeptide. Plasmin, calpain and leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3 cleaved at multiple sites and would be expected to disable PAR1 by cleaving COOH-terminal to the activation site. Cleavage specificities were further confirmed using activation site defective PAR1E S42P mutant polypeptides. Surface plasmon resonance studies on immobilized PAR1E or PAR1E S42P were consistent with cleavage results obtained in solution and allowed us to determine affinities of PAR1E-thrombin binding. FACS analyses of intact platelets confirmed the cleavage of PAR1 downstream of the Arg41-Ser42 site. Mass spectrometry studies of PAR2E predicted activation of PAR2 by trypsin through cleavage at the Arg36-Ser37 site, no effect of thrombin, and inactivation of the receptor by plasmin, calpain and leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3. The inhibitory effect of elastase was confirmed on native PAR1 and PAR2 on the basis of Ca(2+) signaling studies in endothelial cells. It was concluded that none of the main proteases generated during fibrinolysis or inflammation appears to be able to signal through PAR1 or PAR2.

We show that Xfz3 activates this pathway in the absence of exogenous ligands, while Xfz4 and Xfz7 interact with Xwnt5A to activate this pathway. Analysis using chimeric receptors reveals that their C-terminal cytoplasmic regions are functionally equivalent in Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Furthermore, a conserved motif (Lys-Thr-X-X-X-Trp) located two amino acids after the seventh transmembrane domain is required for activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and for membrane relocalization and phosphorylation of Dishevelled. Frizzled receptors with point mutations affecting either of the three conserved residues are defective in Wnt/beta-catenin signalling.

A ligand for the erbB2 receptor has not yet been identified but it can be activated by heterodimerization with heregulin (HRG)-stimulated erbB3 and erbB4 receptors. The HRGs are a family of polypeptide growth factors that have been shown to play a role in embryogenesis, tumor formation, growth and differentiation of breast cancer cells. The erbB3 and erbB4 receptors are involved in transregulation of erbB2 signaling. The work presented here suggests biological roles for HRG including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and induction of motility and invasion in breast cancer cells. HRG-expressing breast cancer cell lines are characterized by low erbB receptor levels and a high invasive and metastatic index, while those which overexpress erbB2 demonstrate minimal invasive potential in vitro and are non-tumorigenic in vivo. Treatment of the highly tumorigenic and metastatic HRG-expressing breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with an HRG-neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited proliferation in culture and motility in the Boyden chamber assay. Addition of exogenous HRG to non-invasive erbB2 overexpressing cells (SKBr-3) at low concentrations induced formation of pseudopodia, enhanced phagocytic activity and increased chemomigration and invasion in the Boyden chamber assay. The specificity of the chemomigration response to HRG is demonstrated by inhibition with the anti-HRG neutralizing antibody.

Cell-binding assays showed that soluble forms of Notch1 and Notch3 proteins physically bound to the three DSL proteins on the cell surface. In solid-phase binding assays using immobilized soluble Notch1 and Notch3 proteins, it was revealed that each DSL protein directly bound to the soluble Notch proteins with different affinities. All interactions between the DSL proteins and soluble Notch proteins were dependent on Ca(2+). Taken together, these results suggest that Delta1, Jagged1, and Jagged2 are ligands for Notch1 and Notch3 receptors.',\n",

The killer cell immunoglobulin-related receptors (KIR), KIR2D, found in human, specifically interact with polymorphic HLA-C molecules. The crystal structure of the inhibitory receptor, KIR2DL1, revealed a relationship to the hematopoietic receptor family, suggesting that the signaling mechanism of KIR2D molecules may resemble that of the hematopoietic receptors, and involve KIR2D dimerization. We have engineered a disulfide-linked dimer of KIR2DL1 by introducing a free cysteine at the C-terminal stem region of the receptor. The disulfide-linked KIR2DL1 dimer binds to HLA-Cw4 at a molar ratio of one dimer to one HLA-Cw4 molecule. Furthermore, the covalently-linked KIR2DL1 dimer binds more tightly to HLA-Cw4 than the wild-type monomer, suggesting the occurrence of a second binding event that increases the overall affinity of KIR dimer for HLA-C.',\n",

Migrating lymphocytes actively modify their environment through a number of mechanisms including proteolysis of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) synthesized by the cells. In this study, expression of MMP upon alpha(4)beta(1)-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to two major ligands, the IIICS-1 domain of fibronectin and VCAM-1, has been examined. Adhesion of T lymphoblastoid Jurkat cells to the CS-1 peptide induced expression of mRNA for two MMPs, gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9). As evaluated by relative RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses, the level of mRNA was upregulated about 4- to 5-fold for both MMPs compared to control cells maintained in suspension. With time, both enzymes were detected in conditioned media and inside the cells, and their identities were verified by Western blotting and gelatin zymography. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the second major alpha(4)beta(1) ligand, VCAM-1, upregulated mRNA for MMP-2 (3.5-fold) and failed to induce expression of mRNA for MMP-9. Accordingly, only MMP-2 protein was detected in conditioned media of cells adherent to VCAM-1. Occupancy of alpha(4)beta(1) on the surface of suspended cells with soluble CS-1 peptide or VCAM-1 did not upregulate synthesis and release of MMPs. A similar pattern of induction of MMPs after adhesion to CS-1 and VCAM-1 was observed in T lymphocytes isolated from human blood. These results demonstrate that adhesion of T lymphocytes through alpha(4)beta(1) to different ligands, which bind to similar or overlapping sites in the integrin, induces intracellular events leading to distinct patterns of MMPs biosynthesis.',\n",

Cortistatin-14 shares 11 of the 14 amino acids of somatostatin-14 yet their nucleotide sequences and chromosomal localization clearly indicate they are products of separate genes. Now cloned from human, mouse and rat sources, cortistatin is known to bind all five cloned somatostatin receptors and share many pharmacological and functional properties with somatostatin including the depression of neuronal activity. However, cortistatin also has many properties distinct from somatostatin including induction of slow-wave sleep, apparently by antagonism of the excitatory effects of acetylcholine on the cortex, reduction of locomotor activity, and activation of cation selective currents not responsive to somatostatin. Expression of mRNA encoding cortistatin follows a circadian rhythm and is upregulated on deprivation of sleep, suggesting cortistatin is a sleep modulatory factor. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of cortistatin, examines the similarities and differences between cortistatin and somatostatin, and asks the question: does cortistatin bind to a cortistatin-specific receptor?',\n",

In the present study, we have characterized fibrinogen interactions with purified alpha(5)beta(1) and have identified the recognition sequence in fibrinogen for alpha(5)beta(1). The binding of fibrinogen to immobilized alpha(5)beta(1) was selectively supported by Mn(2+). Fibrinogen bound to purified alpha(5)beta(1) in a time-dependent, specific, and saturable manner in the presence of Mn(2+), and the binding was blocked completely by Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing peptides and by anti-alpha(5) and anti-alpha(5)beta(1) monoclonal antibodies. A monoclonal antibody directed to the C-terminal RGD sequence at Aalpha572-574 significantly inhibited the binding of fibrinogen to alpha(5)beta(1), whereas monoclonal antibodies directed to either the N-terminal RGD sequence at Aalpha95-97 or the C-terminus of the gamma-chain did not. Furthermore, substituting RGE for RGD at position Aalpha95-97 in recombinant fibrinogen had a minimal effect on binding, whereas substituting RGE for RGD at position Aalpha572-574 decreased binding by 90%.

Moderate levels were detected in dorsal horn of spinal cord and lower levels in aorta (22. 5+/-6 amol mm(-2)). In human tissues density was highest in skeletal muscle and cerebral cortex ( approximately 30 amol mm(-2)), with lower levels (<15 amol mm(-2)) in kidney cortex and left ventricle.

U-II contracted human coronary, mammary and radial arteries, saphenous and umbilical veins with sub-nanomolar EC(50) values. U-II was 50 times more potent in arteries and <10 times more potent in veins than endothelin-1 (ET-1). The maximum response to U-II ( approximately 20% of control KCl) was significantly less than to ET-1 ( approximately 80% KCl). In contrast, in rat aorta, U-II and ET-1 were equipotent with similar maximum responses. This is the first report of high affinity receptors for [(125)I]-U-II in human CNS and peripheral tissues.

Purified pro-sPLA2-X was found to possess a propeptide of 11 amino acid residues attached at the NH2-terminals of the mature protein, and showed as little as 8% of the PLA2 activity of the mature form. Limited proteolysis of pro-sPLA2-X with trypsin resulted in the appearance of the mature form with a concomitant increase in PLA2 activity, suggesting a requirement of proteolytic removal of the propeptide for the optimal activity. The expression of sPLA2-X mRNA was detected in various tissues including the lung, thymus, and spleen, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed its expression in splenic macrophages. In the spleen cells, mature sPLA2-X elicited a prompt release of arachidonic acid with significant production of prostaglandin E2 more efficiently than group IB and IIA sPLA2s. In addition, sPLA2-X was identified as a high-affinity ligand for both native and recombinant form of mouse PLA2 receptor (PLA2R). However, there was no significant difference in the sPLA2-X-induced arachidonic acid release responses in the spleen cells between wild-type and PLA2R-deficient mice. These findings strongly suggest that sPLA2-X possesses two distinct biological functions in mice: it elicits a marked release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids leading to the production of lipid mediators based on its enzymatic potency, and it acts as a natural ligand for the PLA2R that has been shown to play a critical role in the production of inflammatory cytokines during endotoxic shock.',\n",

In this study we have used several approaches to investigate the GPIb alpha-thrombin interaction in more detail and to study its effect on the thrombin-induced elaboration of fibrin. We found that both glycocalicin and the amino-terminal fragment of GPIb alpha reduced the release of fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen by about 50% by a noncompetitive allosteric mechanism. Similarly, GPIb alpha caused in thrombin an allosteric reduction in the rate of turnover of the small peptide substrate d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA. The K(d) for the glycocalicin-thrombin interaction was 1 microm at physiological ionic strength but was highly salt-dependent, decreasing to 0.19 microm at 100 mm NaCl (Gamma(salt) = -4.2). The salt dependence was characteristic of other thrombin ligands that bind to exosite II of this enzyme, and we confirmed this as the GPIb alpha-binding site on thrombin by using thrombin mutants and by competition binding studies. R68E or R70E mutations in exosite I of thrombin had little effect on its interaction with GPIb alpha. Both the allosteric inhibition of fibrinogen turnover caused by GPIb alpha binding to these mutants, and the K(d) values for their interactions with GPIb alpha were similar to those of wild-type thrombin. In contrast, R89E and K248E mutations in exosite II of thrombin markedly increased the K(d) values for the interactions of these thrombin mutants with GPIb alpha by 10- and 25-fold, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that low molecular weight heparin (which binds to thrombin exosite II) but not hirugen (residues 54-65 of hirudin, which binds to exosite I of thrombin) inhibited thrombin binding to GPIb alpha. These data demonstrate that GPIb alpha binds to thrombin exosite II and in so doing causes a conformational change in the active site of thrombin by an allosteric mechanism that alters the accessibility of both its natural substrate, fibrinogen, and the small peptidyl substrate d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA.',\n",

The affinity of TfR2 for iron-loaded Tf was determined to be 27 nm, 25-fold lower than the affinity of TfR for Tf.

The present study characterizes the binding of [(125)I]-PrRP-20 to HEK293 cells stably expressing GPR10 receptors. Specific binding of [(125)I]-PrRP-20 was saturable, and analysis suggested evidence of both high and low affinity sites, with K:(D:) values of 0.026+/-0.006 and 0.57+/-0.14 nM respectively, and B(max) values of 3010+/-400 and 8570+/-2240 fmol mg protein(-1) respectively. Kinetic studies were unable to distinguish two sites, but single site analysis of association and dissociation data produced a K:(D:) of 0.012 nM.

A range of other drugs which are known ligands at receptors which share limited homology with GPR10 were also tested. None of the drugs tested, including the RF-amide neuropeptide FF, demonstrated any affinity for GPR10. Human PrRP-20 failed to alter basal or forskolin-stimulated levels of intracellular cyclic AMP in HEK293-GPR10 cells, suggesting that GPR10 does not couple via either G(s) or G(i). Functional studies using measurements of intracellular calcium confirmed that human and rat PrRP-20 and PrRP-31 are all potent, full agonists at the GPR10 receptor. The response was blocked both by thapsigargin, indicating mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) stores. These studies indicate that [(125)I]-PrRP-20 is a specific, high affinity radioligand for GPR10.

In this report, we describe the analysis of pharmacological properties of the human calcitonin receptor (hCTR) coexpressed with different RAMPs with the use of the Xenopus laevis melanophore expression system. We show that coexpression of RAMP3 with human calcitonin receptor changed the relative potency of hCTR to human calcitonin (hCAL) and rat amylin. RAMP1 and RAMP2, in contrast, had little effect on the change of hCTR potency to hCAL or rat amylin. When coexpressed with RAMP3, hCTR reversed the relative potency by a 3.5-fold loss in sensitivity to hCAL and a 19-fold increase in sensitivity to rat amylin. AC66, an inverse agonist, produced apparent simple competitive antagonism of hCAL and rat amylin, as indicated by linear Schild regressions. The potency of AC66 was changed in the blockade of rat amylin but not hCAL responses with RAMP3 coexpression. The mean pK(B) for AC66 to hCAL was 9.4 +/- 0.3 without RAMP3 and 9.45 +/- 0.07 with RAMP3. For the antagonism of AC66 to rat amylin, the pK(B) was 9.25 +/- 0.15 without RAMP3 and 8.2 +/- 0.35 with RAMP3. The finding suggests that RAMP3 might modify the active states of calcitonin receptor in such a way as to create a new receptor phenotype that is \"amylin-like.\" Irrespective of the physiological association of the new receptor species, the finding that a coexpressed membrane protein can completely change agonist and antagonist affinities for a receptor raises implications for screening in recombinant receptor systems.',\n",

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (RET) techniques, we demonstrate that LPS triggers a physical association between CD14 and TLR4. Because LPS stimulation upregulates CD14 and TLR4 expression, it was necessary to control for the possibility that these newly expressed molecules were associated with one another independent of LPS stimulation. Although the calcium ionophore A23187 increased the expression of CD14 and TLR4, they did not exhibit energy transfer. However, following A23187 treatment, LPS promoted physical proximity between CD14 and TLR4.

Expression of the CRF2-9 chain in monkey COS cells renders them sensitive to IL-TIF. However, in hamster cells both chains, CRF2-9 and IL-10R2, must be expressed to assemble the functional IL-TIF receptor complex. The CRF2-9 chain (or the IL-TIF-R1 chain) is responsible for Stat recruitment. Substitution of the CRF2-9 intracellular domain with the IFN-gammaR1 intracellular domain changes the pattern of IL-TIF-induced Stat activation. The CRF2-9 gene is expressed in normal liver and kidney, suggesting a possible role for IL-TIF in regulating gene expression in these tissues. Each chain, CRF2-9 and IL-10R2, is capable of binding IL-TIF independently and can be cross-linked to the radiolabeled IL-TIF. However, binding of IL-TIF to the receptor complex is greater than binding to either receptor chain alone. Sharing of the common IL-10R2 chain between the IL-10 and IL-TIF receptor complexes is the first such case for receptor complexes with chains belonging to the class II cytokine receptor family, establishing a novel paradigm for IL-10-related ligands similar to the shared use of the gamma common chain (gamma(c)) by several cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15.',\n",

This neocytokine interacts with a previously undescribed dimeric form of the human IL-2 receptor beta-chain likely to form the p1-30 receptor (p1-30R). P1-30 acts as a specific IL-2Rbeta agonist, selectively inducing activation of CD8 and NK lymphocytes. From human PBMC we have also shown that p1-30 induces the activation of lymphokine-activated killer cells and the production of IFN-gamma. Here we demonstrate the ability of p1-30 to act in synergy with IL-2, -4, -9, and -15. These synergistic effects were analyzed at the functional level by using TS1beta, a murine T cell line endogenously expressing the common cytokine gamma gene and transfected with the human IL-2Rbeta gene. At the receptor level, we show that expression of human IL-2Rbeta is absolutely required to obtain synergistic effects, whereas IL-2Ralpha specifically impedes the synergistic effects obtained with IL-2. The results suggest that overexpression of IL-2Ralpha inhibits p1-30R formation in the presence of IL-2. Finally, concerning the molecular effects, although p1-30 alone induces the antiapoptotic molecule bcl-2, we show that it does not influence mRNA expression of c-myc, c-jun, and c-fos oncogenes. In contrast, p1-30 enhances IL-2-driven expression of these oncogenes. Our data suggest that p1-30R (IL-2Rbeta)(2) and intermediate affinity IL-2R (IL-2Rbetagamma), when simultaneously expressed at the cell surface, may induce complementary signal transduction pathways and act in synergy.',\n",

Mutations in EDA give rise to a clinical syndrome characterized by loss of hair, sweat glands, and teeth. EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 are two isoforms of ectodysplasin that differ only by an insertion of two amino acids. This insertion functions to determine receptor binding specificity, such that EDA-A1 binds only the receptor EDAR, whereas EDA-A2 binds only the related, but distinct, X-linked ectodysplasin-A2 receptor (XEDAR).

We have shown that alpha-MSH and ACTH bind the human MC1R with equal affinity, and are equipotent in their mitogenic and melanogenic effects on human melanocytes. We also showed that the activation of the MC1R is important for the melanogenic response of human melanocytes to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The MC1R is also the principal mediator of the inhibitory effects of agouti signaling protein (ASP) on melanogenesis. Expression of the MC1R is subject to regulation by its own ligands alpha-MSH and ACTH, as well as by UVR and endothelin-1. Recent studies that we conducted on the expression of MC1R variants by human melanocytes and the implications of these variants on the function of the MC1R revealed the following. Human melanocytes homozygous for Arg160Trp mutation in the MC1R demonstrated a significantly reduced response to alpha-MSH. Also, this culture responded poorly to ASP and exhibited an exaggerated cytotoxic response to UVR. Another culture, which was homozygous for Val92Met mutation in the MC1R, demonstrated a normal response to alpha-MSH. Heterozygous mutations that are frequently expressed in various melanocyte cultures did not disrupt MC1R function. These results begin to elucidate the significance of MC1R variants in the function of the receptor. Our data emphasize the significance of a normally functioning MC1R in the response of melanocytes to melanocortins, ASP, and UVR.',\n",

The DCC (for deleted in colorectal cancer) protein was proposed as a receptor for netrin-1 in the light of many observations including the inhibition of netrin-1-mediated axon outgrowth and attraction in the presence of an anti-DCC antiserum, the similitude of nervous system defects in DCC and netrin-1 knockout mice and the results of receptor swapping experiments. Previous studies have failed to show a direct interaction of DCC with netrin-1 (ref. 10), suggesting the possibility of an additional receptor or co-receptor. Here we show that DCC interacts with the membrane-associated adenosine A2b receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor that induces cAMP accumulation on binding adenosine. We show that A2b is actually a netrin-1 receptor and induces cAMP accumulation on binding netrin-1. Finally, we show that netrin-1-dependent outgrowth of dorsal spinal cord axons directly involves A2b. Together our results indicate that the growth-promoting function of netrin-1 may require a receptor complex containing DCC and A2b.',\n",

However, it is unclear how glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored uPAR, which lacks a transmembrane structure, mediates signal transduction. It has been proposed that uPAR forms cis-interactions with integrins as an associated protein and thereby transduces proliferative or migratory signals to cells upon binding of uPA. We provide evidence that soluble uPAR (suPAR) specifically binds to integrins alpha4beta1, alpha6beta1, alpha9beta1, and alphavbeta3 on Chinese hamster ovary cells in a cation-dependent manner. Anti-integrin and anti-uPAR antibodies effectively block binding of suPAR to these integrins. Binding of suPAR to alpha4beta1 and alphavbeta3 is blocked by known soluble ligands and by the integrin mutations that inhibit ligand binding. These results suggest that uPAR is an integrin ligand rather than, or in addition to, an integrin-associated protein. In addition, we demonstrate that glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored uPAR on the cell surface specifically binds to integrins on the apposing cells, suggesting that uPAR-integrin interaction may mediate cell-cell interaction (trans-interaction). These previously unrecognized uPAR-integrin interactions may allow uPAR to transduce signals through the engaged integrin without a hypothetical transmembrane adapter and may provide a potential therapeutic target for control of inflammation and cancer.',\n",

This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the involvement of individual integrins in cell interactions with laminins and the roles of laminin-binding integrins in adhesion-mediated events in vertebrates, including embryonic development, cell migration and tumor cell invasiveness, cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as basement membrane assembly. We discuss the regulation of integrin function via alternative splicing of cytoplasmic domains of alpha and beta subunits of the integrin receptors for laminins and present examples of functional collaboration between laminin-binding integrins and non-integrin laminin receptors.

However, the AT(2) receptor signal transduction mechanisms are poorly understood. We have measured AT(2)-triggered activation of purified heterotrimeric proteins in urea-extracted membranes from cultured COS-7 cells expressing the recombinant receptor. This procedure removes contaminating GTP-binding proteins without inactivating the serpentine receptor. Binding studies using [(125)I] angiotensin (Ang) II revealed a single binding site with a K(d)=0.45 and a capacity of 627 fmol/mg protein in the extracted membranes. The AT(2) receptor caused a rapid activation of alpha(i) and alpha(o) but not of alpha(q) and alpha(s), as measured by radioactive guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS) binding. Activation required the presence of activated receptors, betagamma, and alpha subunits. As a first step aimed at developing an in vitro assay to examine AT(2) receptor pharmacology, we tested a battery of Ang II-related ligands for their ability to promote AT(1) or AT(2) receptor-catalyzed G(i) activation. Two proteolytic fragments of Ang II, Ang III and Ang1-7, also promoted activation of alpha(i) through the AT(2) receptor. Furthermore, we found that [Sar(1),Ala(8)]Ang II is an antagonist for both AT(1) and AT(2) receptors and that CPG42112 behaves as a partial agonist for the AT(2) receptor. In combination with previous observations, these results show that the AT(2) receptor is fully capable of activating G(i) and provides a new tool for exploring AT(2) receptor pharmacology and interactions with G-protein trimers.\",\n",

HK-1 has several biological activities that are similar to the most studied tachykinin, substance P, such as induction of plasma extravasation and mast cell degranulation. However, HK-1 also has properties that are indicative of a critical role in mouse B cell development. HK-1 stimulated the proliferation of interleukin 7-expanded B cell precursors, whereas substance P had no effect. HK-1, but not substance P, promoted the survival of freshly isolated bone marrow B lineage cells or cultured, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated pre-B cells. N-acetyl-L-trytophan-3,5-bistrifluromethyl benzyl ester, a tachykinin receptor antagonist, increased apoptosis of these cells and in vivo administration of this antagonist led to specific reductions of the B220lowCD43 population (the pre-B cell compartment) in the bone marrow and the IgMhighIgDlow population (the newly generated B cells) in the spleen.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are thought to play a role in cortical neurogenesis by regulating the action of FGF2 on neural precursor cells. In this article, we present data indicating that glypican-4 (K-glypican), a GPI-anchored cell surface HSPG, is involved in these processes. In the developing mouse brain, glypican-4 mRNA is expressed predominantly in the ventricular zone of the telencephalon. Neither the outer layers of the telencephalic wall nor the ventricular zone of other parts of the developing brain express significant levels of glypican-4, with the exception of the ventricular zone of the tectum. In cultures of E13 rat cortical precursor cells, glypican-4 is expressed in cells immunoreactive for nestin and the D1.1 antigen, markers of neural precursor cells. Glypican-4 expression was not detected in early postmitotic or fully differentiated neurons. Recombinant glypican-4 produced in immortalized neural precursor cells binds FGF2 through its heparan sulfate chains and suppressed the mitogenic effect of FGF2 on E13 cortical precursor cells. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of glypican-4 in the developing cerebral wall significantly overlaps with that of FGF2. These results suggest that glypican-4 plays a critical role in the regulation of FGF2 action during cortical neurogenesis.',\n",

Although crystal structures of binary complexes of FGF-heparin and FGF-FGFR have been described, the molecular architecture of the FGF signalling complex has not been elucidated. Here we report the crystal structure of the FGFR2 ectodomain in a dimeric form that is induced by simultaneous binding to FGF1 and a heparin decasaccharide. The complex is assembled around a central heparin molecule linking two FGF1 ligands into a dimer that bridges between two receptor chains. The asymmetric heparin binding involves contacts with both FGF1 molecules but only one receptor chain.

However, when leukocytes are exposed to an appropriate agonist, high-affinity ligand binding is achieved, presumably as a result of conformational changes in the integrin. In this study, we describe a novel monoclonal antibody, mAb 6C1, directed against the alphaM subunit, which directly induces adhesion of alphaMbeta2-transfected CHO cells to fibrinogen, ICAM-1, and iC3b. Induction of binding could also be accomplished by monovalent Fab fragments of mAb 6C1 at concentrations similar to that observed with intact IgG, demonstrating stimulation of adhesion was not because of receptor cross-linking at the cell surface. The binding of mAb 6C1 induces conformational changes in the receptor, as evidenced by the expression of an \"activation reporter\" epitope recognized by mAb 24. The binding of mAb 6C1 is modulated by divalent cations. Mn2+ promoted high levels of 6C1 binding, and Mg2+ supported low levels of binding, however Ca2+ failed to support binding. A unique distinction of mAb 6C1 is localization of its epitope to the alphaM I domain. The alphaM I domain is essential for ligand binding, can directly bind divalent cations, and participates in the regulation of alphaMbeta2 ligand-binding affinity. Thus, these studies have identified a novel alphaM I domain activation epitope of alphaMbeta2 and support the idea that the I domain modulates the activational state of the beta2 integrins.',\n",

Con A-activated splenocytes of IL-12R beta 2(-/-) mice failed to produce IFN-gamma or proliferate in response to IL-12 stimulation. NK lytic activity of IL-12R beta 2(-/-) splenocytes was not induced when incubated with IL-12. IL-12R beta 2(-/-) splenocytes were deficient in IFN-gamma secretion when stimulated with either Con A or anti-CD3 mAb in vitro. Furthermore, IL-12R beta 2(-/-) mice were deficient in vivo in their ability to produce IFN-gamma following endotoxin administration and to generate a type 1 cytokine response. IL-12-mediated signal transduction was also defective as measured by phosphorylation of STAT4.

G-CSF was infused at bolus doses of 1 microg/kg and 5 microg/kg, and compared to placebo and dexamethasone (1 mg/kg b.i.d), which enhances the plasma levels of endogenous G-CSF. The study was randomized, double-blind, four-way crossover, in eight healthy male volunteers. G-CSF dose-independently induced profound neutropenia (> 95%) within minutes and downregulated its own receptor (CD114) on neutrophils by 75%.

By 10.75 days post coitum, large vitelline vessels were poorly developed, and the capillary plexus was disorganized. At this stage, vasculogenesis in the placenta was also defective, although that in the embryo proper was normal.

EPCR is homologous to the MHC class 1/CD1 family, members of which contain two alpha-helices that sit upon an 8-stranded beta-sheet platform. In this study, we identified 10 residues that, when mutated to alanine, result in the loss of protein C/APC binding (Arg-81, Leu-82, Val-83, Glu-86, Arg-87, Phe-146, Tyr-154, Thr-157, Arg-158, and Glu-160). Glutamine substitutions at the four N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites of EPCR have little affect on APC binding, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties of EPCR are not critical for ligand recognition. We then mapped the epitopes for four anti-human EPCR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), two of which block EPCR/Fl-APC (APC labeled at the active site with fluorescein) interactions, whereas two do not. These epitopes were localized by generating human-mouse EPCR chimeric proteins, since the mAbs under investigation do not recognize mouse EPCR. We found that 5 of the 10 candidate residues for protein C/APC binding (Arg-81, Leu-82, Val-83, Glu-86, Arg-87) colocalize with the epitope for one of the blocking mAbs. Three-dimensional molecular modeling of EPCR indicates that the 10 protein C/APC binding candidate residues are clustered at the distal end of the two alpha-helical segments. Protein C activation studies on 293 cells that coexpress EPCR variants and thrombomodulin demonstrate that protein C binding to EPCR is necessary for the EPCR-dependent enhancement in protein activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. These studies indicate that EPCR has exploited the MHC class 1 fold for an alternative and possibly novel mode of ligand recognition. These studies are also the first to identify the protein C/APC binding region of EPCR and may provide useful information about molecular defects in EPCR that could contribute to cardiovascular disease susceptibility.',\n",

In an effort to identify receptor residues that might interact with amino acids in this tripeptide sequence 24 hMC4R transmembrane (TM) residues were mutated (the rationale for choosing specific receptor residues for mutation is outlined in the Results section). Mutation of TM3 residues D122 and D126 and TM6 residues F261 and H264 decreased the binding affinity of NDP-MSH 5-fold or greater, thereby identifying these receptor residues as sites potentially involved in the sought after ligand-receptor interactions.

The individual domain structures of protein C in solution are largely unaffected by solvation, whereas the Gla-epidermal growth factor-1 orientation evolves to a form different from both factors VII(a) and IX(a). The solution structure of the zymogen protein C is compared with the crystal structures of the existing zymogen serine proteases: chymotrypsinogen, proproteinase, and prethrombin-2.

The agonistic effect is attributed to the similarity of regional structures between RP S19 and C5a, the complement C5-derived leukocyte chemotactic factor, although overall homology of the amino acid sequence between these molecules is only 4%. The antagonistic effect depends upon the C-terminal portion of RP S19. The RP S19 dimer is produced and released by apoptotic cells, and this dimer recruits monocytes from the circulation to the apoptotic lesion. The infiltrated monocytes/macrophages engulf the apoptotic cells, translocate to regional lymph nodes via lymphatics and present the antigenic information of the apoptotic cells to the T cell repertoire. In this manner, the apoptotic cell clearance system connects to the acquired immune system.

The hybrid was 5-fold more potent than I-TAC as an inhibitor of eotaxin activity and was effective at concentrations as low as 5 nm. None of the antagonists described induced the internalization of CCR3, indicating that they lack agonistic effects and thus qualify as pure antagonists. These results suggest that chemokines that attract Th1 cells via CXCR3 can concomitantly block the migration of Th2 cells in response to CCR3 ligands, thus enhancing the polarization of T cell recruitment.',\n",

This receptor is widely distributed in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract; target disruption leads to obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, however, its role in physiological and pathological processes remain unknown due to lack of selective ligands or identification of its natural ligand. We have recently discovered (Mantey, S. A., Weber, H. C., Sainz, E., Akeson, M., Ryan, R. R. Pradhan, T. K., Searles, R. P., Spindel, E. R., Battey, J. F., Coy, D. H., and Jensen, R. T. (1997) J.

However, use of this ligand is limited because it has high affinity for all known Bn receptors. In the present study we have attempted to identify BRS-3 selective ligands using a strategy of rational peptide design with the substitution of conformationally restricted amino acids into the prototype ligand [d-Tyr(6),beta-Ala(11),Phe(13),Nle(14)]Bn-(6-14) or its d-Phe(6) analogue. Each of the 22 peptides synthesized had binding affinities determined for hBRS-3, hGRPR, and hNMBR, and hBRS-3 selective ligands were tested for their ability to activate phospholipase C and increase inositol phosphates ([(3)H]inositol phosphate). Using this approach we have identified a number of BRS-3 selective ligands. These ligands functioned as receptor agonists and their binding affinities were reflected in their potencies for altering [(3)H]inositol phosphate. Two peptides with an (R)- or (S)-amino-3-phenylpropionic acid substitution for beta-Ala(11) in the prototype ligand had the highest selectivity for the hBRS-3 over the mammalian Bn receptors and did not interact with receptors for other gastrointestinal hormones/neurotransmitters. Molecular modeling demonstrated these two selective BRS-3 ligands had a unique conformation of the position 11 beta-amino acid. This selectivity was of sufficient magnitude that these should be useful in explaining the role of hBRS-3 activation in obesity, glucose homeostasis, hypertension, and other physiological or pathological processes.',\n",

CD100 receptors with different binding affinities were detected on renal tubular cells (K(d) = approximately 1 x 10(-9)M) and lymphocytes (K(d) = approximately 3 x 10(-7)M). Expression cloning revealed that the CD100 receptor on lymphocytes is CD72, a negative regulator of B cell responsiveness. CD72 thus represents a novel class of semaphorin receptors. CD100 stimulation induced tyrosine dephosphorylation of CD72 and dissociation of SHP-1 from CD72. Our findings indicate that CD100 plays a critical role in immune responses by the novel mechanism of turning off negative signaling by CD72.',\n",

The inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), associated with different mutations in RET, is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma. GDNF signals via GFRalpha1, neurturin via GFRalpha2, artemin via GFRalpha3, whereas the mammalian GFRalpha receptor for persephin (PSPN) is unknown. Here we characterize the human GFRalpha4 as the ligand-binding subunit required together with RET for PSPN signaling. Human and mouse GFRalpha4 lack the first Cys-rich domain characteristic of other GFRalpha receptors. Unlabeled PSPN displaces (125)I-PSPN from GFRA4-transfected cells, which express endogenous Ret. PSPN can be specifically cross-linked to mammalian GFRalpha4 and Ret, and is able to promote autophosphorylation of Ret in GFRA4-transfected cells. PSPN, but not other GDNF family ligands, promotes the survival of cultured sympathetic neurons microinjected with GFRA4. We identified different splice forms of human GFRA4 mRNA encoding for two glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked and one putative soluble isoform that were predominantly expressed in the thyroid gland. Overlapping expression of RET and GFRA4 but not other GFRA mRNAs in normal and malignant thyroid medullary cells suggests that GFRalpha4 may restrict the MEN2 syndrome to these cells.',\n",

The first is a BBXB motif common in heparin-binding proteins, and the second is located in the loop directly preceding the C-terminal helix. We have mutated these residues to alanine, both as point mutations as well as triple mutations of the 40s and 50s clusters. Using a binding assay to heparin beads with radiolabeled proteins, the (44)AANA(47) mutant demonstrated an 80% reduction in its capacity to bind heparin, whereas the (55)AAWVA(59) mutant retained full binding capacity. Mutation of the (44)RKNR(47) site reduced the selectivity of RANTES binding to different GAGs. The mutants were tested for their integrity by receptor binding assays on CCR1 and CCR5 as well as their ability to induce chemotaxis in vitro. In all assays the single point mutations and the triple 50s cluster mutation caused no significant difference in activity compared with the wild type sequence. However, the triple 40s mutant showed a 80-fold reduction in affinity for CCR1, despite normal binding to CCR5. It was only able to induce monocyte chemotaxis at micromolar concentrations. The triple 40s mutant was also able to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity, but consistent with its abrogated GAG binding capacity, it no longer induced enhanced infectivity at high concentrations.',\n",

Since an understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to high-affinity receptor (R) binding and activation may facilitate the development of more potent GLP-1R agonists, we have localized specific regions of GLP-1R required for binding. The purified N-terminal fragment (hereafter referred to as NT) of the GLP-1R produced in either insect (Sf9) or mammalian (COS-7) cells was shown to bind GLP-1. The physical interaction of NT with GLP-1 was first demonstrated by cross-linking ((125)I-GLP-1/NT complex band at approximately 28 kDa) and secondly by attachment to Ni(2+)-NTA beads. The GLP-1R NT protein attached to beads bound GLP-1, but with lower affinity (inhibitory concentration (IC(50)): 4.5 x 10(-7) M) than wild-type (WT) GLP-1R (IC(50): 5.2 x 10(-9)M). The low affinity of GLP-1R NT suggested that other receptor domains may contribute to GLP-1 binding. This was supported by studies using chimeric glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptors. GIP(1-151)/GLP-1R, but not GIP(1-222)/GLP-1R, exhibited specific GLP-1 binding and GLP-1-induced cAMP production, suggesting that the region encompassing transmembrane (TM) domain 1 through to TM3 was required for binding. Since it was hypothesized that certain charged or polar amino acids in this region might be involved in binding, these residues (TM2-TM3) were analyzed by substitution mutagenesis. Five mutants (K197A, D198A, K202A, D215A, R227A) displayed remarkably reduced binding affinity. These studies indicate that the NT domain of the GLP-1R is able to bind GLP-1, but charged residues concentrated at the distal TM2/extracellular loop-1 (EC1) interface (K197, D198, K202) and in EC1 (D215 and R227) probably contribute to the binding determinants of the GLP-1R.',\n",

In Rat1 and Balb/c3T3 fibroblasts and in neurons the IGF-I receptor is coupled to an inhibitory G protein, G(i), which mediates G(beta)gamma-dependent MAP kinase activation. The present study determined whether in normal human intestinal smooth muscle cells the IGF-I receptor activates a heterotrimeric G protein and the role of G protein activation in mediating IGF-I-induced growth. IGF-I elicited IGF-I receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in the specific activation of G(i2). G(beta)gamma subunits selectively mediated IGF-I-dependent MAP kinase activation; G(alpha)i2 subunits selectively mediated IGF-I-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. IGF-I-stimulated MAP kinase activation and growth were inhibited by pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of G(i)/G(o) activation. Cyclic AMP inhibits growth of human intestinal muscle cells. IGF-I inhibited both basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. This inhibition was attenuated in the presence of pertussis toxin. IGF-I stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, in contrast to MAP kinase activation, occurred independently of G(i2) activation. These data suggest that IGF-I specifically activates G(i2), resulting in concurrent G(beta)gamma-dependent stimulation of MAP kinase activity and growth, and G(alpha)i2-dependent inhibition of cAMP levels resulting in disinhibition of cAMP-mediated growth suppression.',\n",

Competitive binding studies using unlabeled agonists and antagonists with hCRF(1) and hCRF(2alpha) receptors revealed that most agonists exhibited higher affinity in displacing agonist radioligands compared with displacement of antagonist radioligands. Exceptions were the agonists human and rat urocortin, which displayed high-affinity binding in the presence of either (125)I-labeled agonist or antagonist ligands. In contrast, the affinities of antagonists were independent of the nature of the radioligand. We also found that, in contrast to the mammalian CRF receptors, the affinity of ligand binding to xCRF(1) and xCRF(2) receptors strongly depended on the nature of the radioligand used for competition. For xCRF(1), competitors showed different rank order binding profiles with (125)I-CRF compared with (125)I-AST as the displaceable ligand. Similarly, binding of competitors to the xCRF(2) receptor showed markedly different profiles with (125)I-CRF as the competed ligand compared with the other radioligands.

In FDCER cell lines, which express endogenous c-Kit, the signaling capacities of such minimal Epo receptor forms (ER-HY343 and ER-HY343F) have been dissected to reveal: 1) that Epo-dependent mitogenesis, survival, and bcl-x gene expression via ER-HY343 depend upon the intactness of the Tyr-343 STAT5 binding site; 2) that ER-HY343-dependent bcl-x(L) gene transcription is enhanced markedly via c-Kit; 3) that socs-3, plfap, dpp-1, and cacy-bp gene transcription is induced via ER-HY343, whereas dpp-1 and cacy-bp gene expression is also supported by ER-HY343F; 4) that ectopically expressed SOCS-3 suppresses proliferative signaling by not only ER-HY343 but also c-Kit; and 5) that in FDCER and primary erythroid cells, c-Kit appears to provide the primary route to MAPK activation.

Laminin alpha5 is present in the subendothelium and is also a constituent of bone marrow sinusoids, suggesting a role for the Lu/laminin interaction in erythropoiesis. The objectives of the current study were to define more precisely the molecular interactions of the extracellular and intracellular regions of human Lu and to clone and characterize a mouse homologue. To this end, complementary DNA and genomic clones for the mouse homologue were sequenced and the mouse Lu gene mapped to a region on chromosome 7 with conserved synteny with human 19q13.2. Mouse and human Lu gps are highly conserved (72% identity) at the amino acid sequence level and both mouse and human Lu gps specifically bind laminin 10/11 with high affinity. Furthermore, the first 3, N-terminal, immunoglobulin superfamily domains of human Lu are critical for this interaction. The results indicated that the cytoplasmic domain of BRIC 221-labeled human Lu gp is linked with the spectrin-based skeleton, affording the speculation that this interaction may be critical for signal transduction. These results further support a role for Lu gps in sickle cell disease and indicate the utility of mouse models to explore the function of Lu gp-laminin 10/11 interaction in normal erythropoiesis and in sickle cell disease.',\n",

Their activities were determined in vitro by means of radioligand binding and isolated smooth muscle pharmacology. NKA was more potent than NKA(4-10) at the human, unlike the rabbit, NK(2) receptor. The contractile response of NKA(4-10) was unaffected by N-terminal acetylation. L-Ala substitution of Asp(4), Val(7), Leu(9), and Met(10) caused an 8- to 80-fold decrease, and substitution of Phe(6) caused a 5000-fold decrease in binding affinity (P < 0.01). Positions Ser(5) and Gly(8) were not significantly affected. In functional studies, a similar pattern was observed. The replacement of residues with their respective D-enantiomer drastically reduced binding affinity and functional potency, particularly at positions 6 and 7 (P < 0.05). NKA(4-10) analogues L-Ala(6), L-Ala(8), D-Phe(6), D-Val(7), and D-Met(10) were partial agonists. An excellent correlation was observed between binding and functional data (r = 0.95). A retro-inverso analogue of NKA(4-10) was inactive. In conclusion, the side chains of Asp(4), Phe(6), Val(7), Leu(9), and Met(10) are structurally important features of NKA(4-10) for agonist activity, and changes in amino acid chirality are detrimental to binding affinity and functional activity. Overall, our data are broadly similar to those of previous studies in the rat. However, at the human NK(2) receptor, unlike the rat, [Ala(8)]NKA(4-10) was an antagonist.',\n",

In the presence of S100A8/A9, arachidonic acid was rapidly taken up by human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a saturable and energy-dependent fashion. Protein-facilitated arachidonate uptake was confirmed by its sensitivity toward the protein modifiers bromobimane and phloretin. Both potassium and sodium depletion did not affect the arachidonate transport, indicating that arachidonate influx was independent of endocytosis. The uptake of exogenous arachidonic acid by HUVEC was predominantly mediated by FAT/CD36. This conclusion was drawn by the findings that (i) arachidonate uptake was drastically inhibited by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate, a specific inhibitor of FAT/CD36; (ii) the maximal inhibition of arachidonate uptake induced by SSO was similar to that effected by ATP depletion; and (iii) the arachidonate transport was 2-fold higher in COS-7 cells transfected with the pEF.BOS-CD36 expression vector than in the empty vector-transfected COS-7 cells. Kinetic studies of arachidonate uptake were indicative for an interaction between fatty acid transporter and S100A8/A9-AA complex that was confirmed by an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay. FAT/CD36 has been suggested to be involved in inflammatory responses, and S100A8/A9 are released from activated leukocytes at inflammatory loci. Therefore, it can be envisioned that their interaction might propagate host response by perpetuating recruitment and activation of cellular effectors.',\n",

By immunohistochemistry, the ephrin-A1 ligand and one of its receptors, EphA2, were detected throughout tumor vasculature. Double-labeling with anti-CD34 antibodies demonstrated that both ephrin-A1 and EphA2 were expressed in xenograft endothelial cells and also tumor cells. Furthermore, EphA2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in the xenograft tumors, indicating that it was activated, presumably by interacting with ephrin-A1. Ephrin-A1 and EphA2 were also detected in both the vasculature and tumor cells of surgically removed human cancers. In an in vitro angiogenesis model, a dominant negative form of EphA2 inhibited capillary tube-like formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), demonstrating a requirement for EphA receptor signaling. These data suggest that ephrin-A1 and EphA2 play a role in human cancers, at least in part by influencing tumor neovascularization.

The major differences between these cells include increased expression of CXCR1, CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, CCR8, and CX(3)CR1 in AD when compared to NA or nonactivated NK cells. The chemotactic response to the CXC and CC chemokines correlated with the receptor expression except that all 3 populations responded to GRO-alpha, despite their lack of CXCR2 expression. Pretreatment of these cells with anti-CXCR2 did not inhibit the chemotactic response to GRO-alpha.

On the basis of our findings that the integrin beta8 subunit is expressed in airway epithelial cells and is absent in lung cancers, we investigated the role and mechanism of the integrin alphavbeta8 in mediating growth inhibition. When introduced into either a lung or colon carcinoma cell line, beta8 inhibited cell growth without inducing apoptosis. Ligation of alphavbeta8 also induced cell rounding, inhibited focal contact formation, and initiated an inhibitory signaling pathway as demonstrated by increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1. The cytoplasmic domain of beta8 was capable of both growth inhibition and causing cell shape changes as shown by the use of a chimeric integrin construct consisting of the beta8-cytoplasmic domain coupled to the beta6-extracellular domain. Finally, when tested in vivo, beta8 potently inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. Together, these results implicate alphavbeta8 as a novel growth-regulatory molecule of epithelial cells.',\n",

L6 cells lacking endogenous TbetaRIII as well as TbetaRII-B do not respond to TGF-beta2. Transfection of these cells with TbetaRII-B restores TGF-beta2 sensitivity. The expression of TbetaRII-B is restricted to cells originating from tissues such as bone where the isoform TGF-beta2 has a predominant role.

CCR9, the specific receptor for the beta-chemokine TECK/CCL25, is selectively expressed in thymus, lymph node, and spleen. Using a specific anti-CCR9 polyclonal antibody, K629, and a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction procedure, a detailed study of CCR9 expression in the thymus and secondary lymphoid organs was performed. The results show that CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes have the highest CCR9 expression in thymus. Single-positive CD8(+) thymocytes continue to express this receptor after abandoning the thymus as mature naive T cells, as suggested by the existence of a CD8(+)CD69(low)CD62L(high) CCR9(+) cell subset. Consistent with this, CD8(+) lymphocytes from lymph nodes, spleen, and Peyer patches express a functional CCR9, as its expression correlates with migration in response to CCL25. Conversely, CD4(+) thymocytes lose CCR9 before abandoning the thymus, and CD4(+) T cells from secondary lymphoid organs also lack CCR9 expression. Analysis of CCR9 expression in thymocytes from mice of different ages showed that CCR9 levels are affected by age, as this receptor is more abundant, and its response to CCL25 is more potent in newborn animals.

In contrast, the chimeric peptide PTHrP-(1-20)/TIP-(23-39) bound to HKrk-B7 cells with affinities of 31 +/- 8.2 and 11 +/- 4.0 nM when using radiolabeled rPTH and PTHrP-(1-36), respectively, and it stimulated cAMP accumulation in HKrk-B7 and SaOS-2 cells with potencies (EC(50), 1.40 +/- 0.3 and 0.38 +/- 0.12 nM, respectively) and efficacies (maximum levels, 39 +/- 8 and 31 +/- 3 pmol/well, respectively) similar to those of PTH-(1-34) and PTHrP-(1-36). In both cell lines, TIP(9-39) and, to a lesser extent, TIP-(1-39) inhibited the actions of the three agonists with efficiencies similar to those of [Leu(11),D-Trp(12),Trp(23),Tyr(36)]PTHrP-(7-36)amide, an established PTH1R antagonist. Taken together, the currently available data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal portion of TIP-(1-39) interacts efficiently with the PTH1R, at sites identical to or closely overlapping those used by PTH-(1-34) and PTHrP-(1-36). The amino-terminal residues of TIP-(1-39), however, are unable to interact productively with the PTH1R, thus enabling TIP-(1-39) and some of its truncated analogs to function as an antagonist at this receptor.',\n",

In the present study myeloma cells, but not lymphoblastoid cells, were shown to bind to immobilised, recombinantly expressed MDC-9 disintegrin domain (A9dis). Binding was divalent cation-dependent, being supported by Mn(2+) and Ca(2+). Adhesion of myeloma cells to A9dis was completely inhibited by an antibody to the alpha(v)beta(5) integrin but not by antibodies to other subunits. RGD-containing peptides had no effect on binding, suggesting that MDC-9 interacts with alpha(v)beta(5) in an RGD-independent manner. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that myeloma cells, but not lymphoblastoid cells, expressed alpha(v)beta(5) on the cell membrane. These data indicated that the disintegrin domain of MDC-9 can function as an adhesion molecule by interacting with an alpha(v)beta(5) integrin.',\n",

In contrast, orexin-B, a peptide containing 28 amino acids without disulfide bond, which has no stimulatory action of gastric acid. The objective of the present study was to characterize the receptor-mediated mechanism of orexin-A-induced stimulation of gastric acid secretion using orexin-A-related peptides with modification of disulfide bonds. Intracisternal injection of orexin-A, but not orexin-B or orexin-A (15-33), that does not contain both disulfide bonds stimulated gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated conscious rats. The ability of the stimulation of gastric acid output was less in three alanine-substituted orexin-A, [Ala(6,12)]orexin-A, [Ala(7,14)]orexin-A, and [Ala(6,7,12,14)]orexin-A, than orexin-A. Orexins-induced calcium increase was measured in CHO-K1 cells expressing OX1R or OX2R. Orexin-A induced a transient increase in [Ca(2+)]i in CHO-K1/OX1R cells in a dose-dependent manner. EC50 values for OX1R of orexin-A, orexin-B, or orexin-A (15-33) was 0.068, 0.69 or 4.1 nM, respectively, suggesting that peptides containing no disulfide bonds have lower potency for the receptor. Agonistic activity for OX1R of the three orexin-A analogues with modification of one or both disulfide bonds was significantly reduced as compared with that of orexin-A. EC50 values for OX2R of orexin-A and orexin-B was almost equal but potency for the receptor of orexin-A (15-33) and three alanine substituted orexin-A was less than that of orexin-A. A significant inverse relationship between gastric acid output and EC50 values for OX1R, but not OX2R, was observed. These results suggested that the orexin-A-induced acid stimulation requires OX1R activation and that disulfide bonds in orexin-A may have a key role in the receptor activation.',\n",

The ability to induce an inhibitory signal in the NK tumor line YTS transfected with KIR2DL1 was also impaired in the nonglycosylated mutant expressing cells. Furthermore, in a second functional assay, mutant HLA-Cw4 and -Cw6 molecules had impaired ability to induce signal transduction in BW cells expressing a KIR2DL1-CD3 zeta chain chimeric protein.

In contrast, third intracellular loop peptides significantly reduced the CB(1) receptor association with G alpha(i1) and G alpha(i2), but not G alpha(i3). These interactions are specific for the CB(1) receptor because a peptide corresponding to the juxtamembrane C-terminal domain of the CB(2) receptor failed to compete for the association of the CB1 receptor with any of the Gi alpha subtypes, and was not able to activate Gi proteins to inhibit adenylate cyclase.

Both ligands BP-MIP-1alpha and Flu-MIP-1alpha retained high binding affinity and agonist potency at CCR1 and CCR5. Photoaffinity labeling of CCR1 and CCR5 receptors stably expressed in CHO cells resulted in specific covalent attachment of [(125)I]BP-MIP-1alpha and production of protein complexes of 54 and 48 kDa, respectively, on SDS-PAGE. This represents the first photo-cross-linking between a chemokine and its receptor. Flu-MIP-1alpha selectively labeled CCR1 or CCR5 receptors expressed in CHO cells and was used to characterize receptor binding domains. When bound to CCR1 or CCR5 receptors, the fluorescence signal of Flu-MIP-1alpha was quenched by collision with iodide indicating that the N-terminal end of MIP-1alpha is accessible to the solvent. These data strongly suggest that the N-terminal end of MIP-1alpha interacts with domains of CCR1 or CCR5 receptors located at the extracellular surface.

The acidic amino terminus of Nogo-A is detected at the cytosolic face of cellular membranes and may contribute to inhibition of axon regeneration at sites of oligodendrocyte injury. Here we show that the extracellular domain of Nogo (Nogo-66) inhibits axonal extension, but does not alter non-neuronal cell morphology. In contrast, a multivalent form of the N terminus of Nogo-A affects the morphology of both neurons and other cell types. Here we identify a brain-specific, leucine-rich-repeat protein with high affinity for soluble Nogo-66. Cleavage of the Nogo-66 receptor and other glycophosphatidylinositol-linked proteins from axonal surfaces renders neurons insensitive to Nogo-66. Nogo-66 receptor expression is sufficient to impart Nogo-66 axonal inhibition to unresponsive neurons. Disruption of the interaction between Nogo-66 and its receptor provides the potential for enhanced recovery after human CNS injury.',\n",

We show here that a seven-transmembrane receptor, CRTH2, which is preferentially expressed in T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, eosinophils, and basophils in humans, serves as the novel receptor for PGD2. In response to PGD2, CRTH2 induces intracellular Ca2+mobilization and chemotaxis in Th2 cells in a Galphai-dependent manner. In addition, CRTH2, but not DP, mediates PGD2-dependent cell migration of blood eosinophils and basophils.

Ucn II binds selectively to the type 2 CRF receptor (CRF-R2), with no appreciable activity on CRF-R1. Transcripts encoding Ucn II are expressed in discrete regions of the rodent central nervous system, including stress-related cell groups in the hypothalamus (paraventricular and arcuate nuclei) and brainstem (locus coeruleus). Central administration of 1-10 microg of peptide elicits activational responses (Fos induction) preferentially within a core circuitry subserving autonomic and neuroendocrine regulation, but whose overall pattern does not broadly mimic the CRF-R2 distribution. Behaviorally, central Ucn II attenuates nighttime feeding, with a time course distinct from that seen in response to CRF. In contrast to CRF, however, central Ucn II failed to increase gross motor activity.

While the binding of 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin to pituitary membranes was completely displaced by unlabelled hexarelin, ghrelin and CST, none of the SRIH fragments tested inhibited this binding. Ghrelin and CST exhibited a similar affinity (4.6-5.4 x 10(-7) mol/l) for the binding while hexarelin was more effective by about four orders of magnitude in displacing 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin.

We show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor activation, either directly by EGF or indirectly via the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) agonist lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), induces cleavage of Met through activation of the Erk MAP kinase signalling cascade. The tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR was a prerequisite for this stimulation, since treatment of cells with a synthetic inhibitor of this receptor, AG1478, completely abrogated shedding. The metalloproteinase mediating Met cleavage was specifically inhibited by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-3, but not by TIMP-1 or TIMP-2.

To identify the amino acid residues on BMP type I receptor responsible for its ligand binding, the structure-activity relationship of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the BMP type IA receptor (sBMPR-IA) was investigated by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The mutant receptors, as well as sBMPR-IA, were expressed as fusion proteins with thioredoxin in Escherichia coli, and purified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) after digestion with enterokinase. Structural analysis of the parent protein and representative mutants in solution by CD showed no detectable differences in their folding structures. The binding affinity of the mutants to BMP-4 was determined by surface plasmon resonance biosensor. All the mutant receptors examined, with the exception of Y70A, displayed reduced affinities to BMP-4 with the rank order of decreases: I52A (17-fold) approximately F75A (15-fold) >> T64A (4-fold) = T62A (4-fold) approximately E54A (3-fold). The decreases in binding affinity observed for the latter three mutants are mainly due to decreased association rate constants while alterations in rate constants both, for association and dissociation, result in the drastically reduced affinities for the former two mutants. These results allow us to conclude that sBMPR-IA recognizes the ligand using the concave face of the molecule. The major ligand-binding site of the BMP type IA receptor consists of Phe75 in loop 2 and Ile52, Glu54, Thr62 and Thr64 on the three-stranded beta-sheet.

These results establish a novel role for syndecan-1 protein in coupling a physiological matrix ligand to formation of a specific matrix contact structure.',\n",

A related molecule called DC-SIGNR exhibits 77% amino acid sequence identity with DC-SIGN. The DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR genes map within a 30-kb region on chromosome 19p13.2-3. Their strong homology and close physical location indicate a recent duplication of the original gene. Messenger RNA and protein expression patterns demonstrate that the DC-SIGN-related molecule is highly expressed on liver sinusoidal cells and in the lymph node but not on DCs, in contrast to DC-SIGN. Therefore, we suggest that a more appropriate name for the DC-SIGN-related molecule is L-SIGN, liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin. We show that in the liver, L-SIGN is expressed by sinusoidal endothelial cells. Functional studies indicate that L-SIGN behaves similarly to DC-SIGN in that it has a high affinity for ICAM-3, captures HIV-1 through gp120 binding, and enhances HIV-1 infection of T cells in trans. We propose that L-SIGN may play an important role in the interaction between liver sinusoidal endothelium and trafficking lymphocytes, as well as function in the pathogenesis of HIV-1.',\n",

Similar to other cytokines, members of the TGF-beta superfamily exhibit stringent specificity in their ligand-receptor interactions, which may be a reason for the qualitative and quantitative differences in cellular responses. To understand how BMPs and GDFs activate their receptors, it is important to determine structure and binding mechanisms of ligand-receptor complexes. We have used BMP-2 as a key representative of the BMPs to identify the epitopes for type I and type II receptor binding by mutational interaction analyses and have solved the crystal structure of a BMP2:BMPR-IA receptor ectodomain complex.',\n",

This study shows that eotaxin also interacts with CCR2 and CCR5 and can, thus, affect the responses of monocytes, which express both receptors. In human monocytes pretreatment with eotaxin decreased responsiveness to MCP-1, a selective ligand for CCR2, as well as to RANTES and MIP-1 beta, which bind to CCR5. Similar effects were obtained with transfected cells expressing CCR2 or CCR5, but here a difference became apparent: Eotaxin triggered CCR5 at a concentration of 100 nM but not CCR2 even at 1 microM, suggesting an antagonistic effect on this receptor. In agreement with this observation, eotaxin induced internalization of CCR5 but not of CCR2 in human monocytes and transfected cells. Binding studies showed that eotaxin displaces (125) I-MCP-1 from monocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, and functional experiments showed that eotaxin inhibits MCP-1-induced chemotaxis and enzyme release. The results demonstrate that eotaxin is a CCR5 agonist and a CCR2 antagonist. The present findings suggest a role of eotaxin in the fine-tuning of cellular responses occurring at sites of allergic inflammation, in which both MCP-1 and eotaxin are produced.

Two inhibin ligands, inhibin A and inhibin B, are made by the ovary in females, and each regulate pituitary FSH at different times during the reproductive cycle. Inhibin B, but not inhibin A, is produced by the testes and is therefore responsible for all inhibin-dependent FSH regulation in males. Although the activin signal transduction pathway has been well characterized, little is known about the mechanism of inhibin signaling and its relationship to activin antagonism. A recently cloned inhibin-binding protein, InhBP (p120), associates strongly with the type IB activin receptor (Alk4) in a ligand-responsive manner and interacts to a lesser extent with other activin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I and activin type II receptors. Activin stimulates the association of InhBP and Alk4, and inhibin B, but not inhibin A, interferes with InhBP-Alk4 complex formation. InhBP is necessary to mediate a specific antagonistic effect of inhibin B on activin-stimulated transcription. Appropriate stoichiometry between InhBP and the activin type I receptor is crucial to InhBP function. These findings suggest that InhBP is an inhibin B-specific receptor that mediates antagonism of activin signal transduction through the modulation of activin heteromeric receptor complex assembly.',\n",

This report describes the cloning and functional characterization of a novel second human MCH receptor, which we designate MCH(2), initially identified in a genomic survey sequence as being homologous to MCH(1) receptors. Using this sequence, a full-length cDNA was generated with an open reading frame of 1023 base pairs, encoding a polypeptide of 340 amino acids, with 38% identity to MCH(1) and with many of the structural features conserved in G protein-coupled receptors. This newly discovered receptor belongs to class 1 (rhodopsin-like) of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. HEK293 cells transfected with MCH(2) receptors responded to nanomolar concentrations of MCH with an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels and increased cellular extrusion of protons. In addition, fluorescently labeled MCH bound with nanomolar affinity to these cells. The tissue localization of MCH(2) receptor mRNA, as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, was similar to that of MCH(1) in that both receptors are expressed predominantly in the brain. The discovery of a novel MCH receptor represents a new potential drug target and will allow the further elucidation of MCH-mediated responses.',\n",

The human type I interferons, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-omega, induce somewhat different cellular effects but act through a common receptor complex, IFNAR, composed of subunits IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2. Human IFNAR-2 binds all type I IFNs but with lower affinity and different specificity than the IFNAR complex. Human IFNAR-1 has low intrinsic binding of human IFNs but strongly affects the affinity and differential ligand specificity of the IFNAR complex. Understanding IFNAR-1 interactions with the interferons is critical to elucidating the differential ligand specificity and activation by type I IFNs. However, studies of ligand interactions with human IFNAR-1 are compromised by its low affinity. The homologous bovine IFNAR-1 serendipitously binds human IFN-alphas with nanomolar affinity. Exploiting its strong binding of human IFN-alpha2, we have identified residues important for ligand binding. Mutagenesis of any of five aromatic residues of bovine IFNAR-1 caused strong decreases in ligand binding, whereas mutagenesis of proximal neutral or charged residues had smaller effects. These residues were mapped onto a homology model of IFNAR-1 to identify the ligand-binding face of IFNAR-1, which is consistent with previous structure/function studies of human IFNAR-1. The topology of IFNAR-1/IFN interactions appears novel when compared with previously studied cytokine receptors.',\n",

The IL-1HY2 gene is located in close proximity to other IL-1 family genes on human chromosome 2, and the genomic organization of the IL-1HY2 gene is highly conserved with other IL-1 family members. IL-1HY2 protein is secreted from mammalian cells, and the purified recombinant IL-1HY2 protein binds soluble IL-1 receptor type I. IL-1HY2 is expressed in human skin, spleen, and tonsil. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the IL-1HY2 protein is expressed in the basal epithelia of skin and in proliferating B cells of the tonsil.

We, therefore, mutagenized human IL-13 in which Glu at position 13 was substituted by a Lys residue. This highly purified recombinant IL-13 variant, IL-13E13K, bound with 4-fold higher affinity to the IL-13 receptor than wild-type IL-13 but retained no detectable proliferative activity on the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line. IL-13E13K competitively inhibited IL-13- and IL-4-dependent TF-1 proliferation. It also inhibited IL-13-induced STAT-6 (signal transduction and activator of transducer-6) activation in immune cells and cancer cells and reversed IL-13-induced inhibition of CD14 expression on human primary monocytes. These results demonstrate that high affinity binding and signal generation can be uncoupled efficiently in a ligand receptor interaction.

A truncated form of TFPI, containing only the first two Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor domains, has very little antiproliferative activity, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal region of TFPI is responsible for this activity. Binding studies revealed that full-length TFPI, but not the truncated TFPI molecule, is recognized by the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL receptor) indicating that this receptor is a novel high affinity endothelial cell receptor for TFPI. The antiproliferative activity of TFPI on endothelial cells is inhibited by the receptor-associated protein, a known antagonist of ligand binding by the VLDL receptor, and by anti-VLDL receptor antibodies. These results confirm that the antiproliferative activity of TFPI is mediated by the VLDL receptor and suggest that this receptor-ligand system may be a useful target for the development of new anti-angiogenic and antitumor agents.',\n",

To identify a receptor for PTN, we panned a phage display human cDNA library against immobilized PTN protein as a bait. From this we isolated a phage insert that was homologous to an amino acid sequence stretch in the extracellular domain (ECD) of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In parallel with PTN, ALK is highly expressed during perinatal development of the nervous system and down-modulated in the adult. Here we show in cell-free assays as well as in radioligand receptor binding studies in intact cells that PTN binds to the ALK ECD with an apparent Kd of 32 +/- 9 pm. This receptor binding is inhibited by an excess of PTN, by the ALK ECD, and by anti-PTN and anti-ECD antibodies. PTN added to ALK-expressing cells induces phosphorylation of both ALK and of the downstream effector molecules IRS-1, Shc, phospholipase C-gamma, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Furthermore, the growth stimulatory effect of PTN on different cell lines in culture coincides with the endogenous expression of ALK mRNA, and the effect of PTN is enhanced by ALK overexpression. From this we conclude that ALK is a receptor that transduces PTN-mediated signals and propose that the PTN-ALK axis can play a significant role during development and during disease processes.',\n",

Previously, the existence of receptors for uptake of CCSP.ligand complexes into the renal proximal tubules had been suggested. Using surface plasmon resonance analysis, we demonstrate that CCSP binds to cubilin, a peripheral membrane protein on the surface of proximal tubular cells. Binding to cubilin results in uptake and lysosomal degradation of CCSP in cultured cells. Surprisingly, internalization of CCSP is blocked not only by cubilin antagonists but also by antibodies directed against megalin, an endocytic receptor that does not bind CCSP but associates with cubilin. Consistent with a role of both receptors in renal uptake of CCSP in vivo, patients deficient for cubilin or mice lacking megalin exhibit a defect in tubular uptake of the protein and excrete CCSP into the urine. These findings identify a cellular pathway consisting of a CCSP-binding protein (cubilin) and an endocytic coreceptor (megalin) responsible for tissue-specific uptake of CCSP and associated ligands.',\n",

Previously we have shown that alpha(7)B as well as the alpha(7)A and -C splice variants induce cell motility on laminin when transfected into nonmotile HEK293 cells. In this study we have investigated the role of the cytoplasmic domain of alpha(7) in the laminin-induced signal transduction of alpha(7)beta(1) integrin regulating cell adhesion and migration. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain did not affect assembly of the mutated alpha(7)Deltacyt/beta(1) heterodimer on the cell surface or adhesion of alpha(7)Deltacyt-transfected cells to laminin. The motility of these cells on the laminin-1/E8 fragment, however, was significantly reduced to the level of mock-transfected cells; lamellipodia formation and polarization of the cells were also impaired. Adhesion to the laminin-1/E8 fragment induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and p130(CAS) as well as the formation of a p130(CAS)-Crk complex in wild-type alpha(7)B-transfected cells. In alpha(7)BDeltacyt cells, however, the extent of p130(CAS) tyrosine formation was reduced and formation of the p130(CAS)-Crk complex was impaired, with unaltered levels of p130(CAS) and Crk protein levels. These findings indicate adhesion-dependent regulation of p130(CAS)/Crk complex formation by the cytoplasmic domain of alpha(7)B integrin after cell adhesion to laminin-1/E8 and imply alpha(7)B-controlled lamellipodia formation and cell migration through the p130(CAS)/Crk protein complex.',\n",

It is now becoming clear that levels of certain MMPs are modulated by their association with cellular receptors that mediate their rapid internalization and degradation. In the current investigation we report that the amount of MMP-9 in conditioned cell culture medium is significantly increased when mouse embryonic fibroblasts are grown in the presence of the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist of ligand binding to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). In vitro assays reveal that the MMP-9.TIMP-1 complex binds to LRP with high affinity and that the binding determinant for LRP appears to reside on MMP-9. Cell lines expressing LRP mediate the internalization of 125I-labeled MMP-9.TIMP-1 complexes, whereas cell lines genetically deficient in LRP show a diminished capacity to mediate the cellular catabolism of MMP-9.TIMP-1 complexes.

Complete truncation of the beta(2) cytoplasmic domain, but not a truncation that retained the membrane proximal eight residues, resulted in constitutive activation of alpha(L)beta(2) and alpha(M)beta(2), demonstrating the importance of this membrane proximal region in the regulation of integrin adhesive function. Furthermore, replacement of the alpha(L) and beta(2) cytoplasmic domains with acidic and basic peptides that form an alpha-helical coiled coil caused inactivation of alpha(L)beta(2). Association of these artificial cytoplasmic domains was directly demonstrated. By contrast, replacement of the alpha(L) and beta(2) cytoplasmic domains with two basic peptides that do not form an alpha-helical coiled coil activated alpha(L)beta(2).

The conceptual protein encoded by cDNA clones consists of V-type and C2-type immunoglobulin domains as well as a hydrophobic signal sequence, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. Northern blot analysis showed ESAM to be selectively expressed in cultured human and murine vascular endothelial cells and revealed high level expression in lung and heart and low level expression in kidney and skin. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that ESAM is primarily expressed in the developing vasculature of the embryo in an endothelial cell-restricted pattern. Epitope-tagged ESAM was shown to co-localize with cadherins and catenins in cell-cell junctions. In aggregation assays employing ESAM-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells, this novel molecule was shown to mediate cell-cell adhesion through homophilic interactions.

By contrast, BMP-6 and BMP-7 induce alkaline phosphatase activity through Smad1 and Smad5, but not through Smad8. Consistent with these findings, BMP-4 induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8, but BMP-6 activated only Smad1 and Smad5. BMP-4 and GDF-5 are known to bind to activin receptor-like kinase 3 (ALK-3) and/or ALK-6 (also termed BMP type IA and type IB receptors, respectively), whereas BMP-6 and BMP-7 preferentially bind to ALK-2. Compared with the effects induced by only one of the type I receptors, the combination of constitutively active forms of ALK-2 and ALK-3 (or ALK-6) more strongly induced alkaline phosphatase activity in C2C12 cells. Moreover, addition of BMP-4 and BMP-6 to C2C12 cells resulted in higher alkaline phosphatase activity than that of only one of these BMPs. The combination of ALK-2 and ALK-3 also induced higher transcriptional activity than either receptor alone.

CNTFR-deficient mice show profound neuronal deficits at birth, leading to a lethal phenotype. In contrast, inactivation of the CNTF gene leads only to a slight muscle weakness, mainly during adulthood, suggesting that CNTFR binds to a second ligand that is important for development. Modelling studies of the interleukin-6 family member cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) revealed structural similarities with CNTF, including the conservation of a site I domain involved in binding to CNTFR. Co-expression of CLC and CNTFR in mammalian cells generates a secreted composite cytokine, displaying activities on cells expressing the gp130-LIFR complex on their surface.

In hepatocytes, activation of PLC-(gamma1) by EGFR requires involvement of a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G(alphai)) as an intermediate. In the present study, we first identified the G(alphai) protein isoform associated with the activated EGFR, and then examined whether the toxic effect of alcohol on EGFR signaling and liver cell proliferation was exerted on this association. In cultured hepatocytes from control rats, EGF rapidly induced association between EGFR and G(alphai2) but not other G(alphai) isoforms. In hepatocytes from rats fed alcohol for 16 weeks, EGF failed to stimulate this association of G(alphai2) with the EGFR. The impairment of EGFR-G(alphai2) complex formation caused by alcohol was associated with a decreased level of G(alphai2) in the plasma membrane fraction (approximately 50% control). Pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of G(alphai) function, produced an analogous disruption of the association between G(alphai2) and the EGFR, as well as inhibiting EGF-induced DNA synthesis. It is concluded that, in hepatocytes, G(alphai2) is specific among G(alphai) isoforms in coupling activation of the EGFR to other signaling pathways that control cell proliferation. Impaired coupling of G(alphai2) of EGFR could contribute to the mechanism by which chronic alcohol exposure inhibits liver regeneration.',\n",

It has been demonstrated recently that adhesion of primary skin fibroblasts to CYR61 is mediated through integrin alpha(6)beta(1) and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, resulting in adhesive signaling and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3. CYR61 is composed of four discrete structural domains that bear sequence similarities to the insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, von Willebrand factor type C repeat, thrombospondin type 1 repeat, and a carboxyl-terminal (CT) domain that resembles cysteine knots found in some growth factors. In this study, we show that a CYR61 mutant (CYR61DeltaCT) that has the CT domain deleted is unable to support adhesion of primary human skin fibroblasts but is still able to stimulate chemotaxis and enhance basic fibroblast growth factor-induced mitogenesis similar to wild type. In addition, fibroblast migration to CYR61 is mediated through integrin alpha(v)beta(5) but not integrins alpha(6)beta(1) or alpha(v)beta(3). Furthermore, we show that CYR61 binds directly to purified integrin alpha(v)beta(5) in vitro. By contrast, CYR61 enhancement of basic fibroblast growth factor-induced DNA synthesis is mediated through integrin alpha(v)beta(3), a known receptor for CYR61 that mediates CYR61-dependent cell adhesion and chemotaxis in vascular endothelial cells. Thus, CYR61 promotes primary human fibroblast adhesion, migration, and mitogenesis through integrins alpha(6)beta(1), alpha(v)beta(5), and alpha(v)beta(3), respectively.

To characterize proteins involved in the reception, detoxification, or degradation of these ligands, a cDNA phage-display library from human pituitary gland was constructed and screened for proteins interacting with Lcn-1. Using this method an Lcn-1 interacting phage was isolated that expressed a novel human protein. Molecular cloning and analysis of the entire cDNA indicated that it encodes a 55-kDa protein, lipocalin-1 interacting membrane receptor (LIMR), with nine putative transmembrane domains. The cell membrane location of this protein was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis of membrane fractions of human NT2 cells. Independent biochemical investigations using a recombinant N-terminal fragment of LIMR also demonstrated a specific interaction with Lcn-1 in vitro. Based on these data, we suggest LIMR to be a receptor of Lcn-1 ligands. These findings constitute the first report of cloning of a lipocalin interacting, plasma membrane-located receptor, in general. In addition, a sequence comparison supports the biological relevance of this novel membrane protein, because genes with significant nucleotide sequence similarity are present in Takifugu rubripes, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Bos taurus, and Sus scrofa.

We recently demonstrated that cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) associates with the soluble orphan receptor cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF) to form a heterodimeric cytokine that displayed activities only on cells expressing the tripartite CNTF receptor on their surface. In this present study we examined the membrane binding of the CLC/CLF composite cytokine and observed a preferential interaction of the cytokine with the CNTFR subunit. Signaling pathways recruited by the CLC/CLF complex in human neuroblastoma cell lines were also analyzed in detail. The results obtained showed an activation of Janus kinases (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2) leading to a tyrosine phosphorylation of the gp130 and LIFR. The phosphorylated signaling receptors served in turn as docking proteins for signal transducing molecules such as STAT3 and SHP-2. In vitro analysis revealed that the gp130-LIFR pathway could also stimulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In contrast to that reported before for CNTF, soluble CNTFR failed to promote the action CLC/CLF, and an absolute requirement of the membrane form of CNTFR was required to generate a functional response to the composite cytokine. This study reinforces the functional similarity between CNTF and the CLC/CLF composite cytokine defining the second ligand for CNTFR.',\n",

The N terminus of the Vps10p domain comprises a consensus sequence for cleavage by furin ((50)RRKR(53)) that precedes a truncation found in sorLA isolated from human brain. Here we show that sorLA, like sortilin-1/neurotensin receptor-3, whose lumenal domain consists of a Vps10p domain only, is synthesized as a proreceptor that is cleaved by furin in late Golgi compartments. We show that the truncation conditions the Vps10p domain for propeptide inhibitable binding of neuropeptides and the receptor-associated protein. We further demonstrate that avid binding of the receptor-associated protein, apolipoprotein E, and lipoprotein lipase not inhibited by propeptide occurs to sites located in other lumenal domains. In transfected cells, about 10% of full-length sorLA were expressed on the cell surface capable of mediating endocytosis. However, the major pool of receptors was found in late Golgi compartments, suggesting possible interaction with newly synthesized ligands. The results show that sorLA, following activation by truncation, binds multiple ligands and may mediate both endocytosis and sorting.',\n",

PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.',\n",

The structure of CCK(A)-R(329-357) in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles consists of three alpha-helices, with the first and third corresponding to the extracellular ends of transmembrane (TM) helices 6 and 7. The central helix, residues W335-R345, is found to lie on the zwitterionic surface. Titration with CCK-8 produces a stable complex with a number of intermolecular NOEs between the C-terminus of the ligand (Trp(30), Met(31), Asp(32)) and the interface of TM6 and the third extracellular loop (N333, A334, Y338) of the receptor fragment. The mode of ligand binding based on these intermolecular NOEs is in agreement with a number of published findings from receptor mutagenesis and photoaffinity cross-linking. Utilizing these ligand/receptor points of interaction, the structural features of CCK(A)-R(329-357), and also the structures of CCK-8 and CCK(A)-R(1-47) previously determined, extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the CCK-8/CCK(A)-R complex were carried out.

The EDA gene encodes different isoforms of ectodysplasin, a transmembrane protein. The two longest isoforms, ectodysplasin-A1 and -A2, which differ by an insertion of two amino acids, are trimeric type II membrane proteins with an extracellular portion containing a short collagenous domain and a TNF ligand motif in the C-terminal region. We show that ectodysplasin is released from cells to the culture medium. Deletion constructs were used to localize the cleavage site and show that the putative recognition sequence of a furin-like enzyme is needed for the cleavage. Some EDA patients have missense mutations affecting this recognition sequence, suggesting that cleavage has biological significance in vivo. EDAR, a recently cloned member of the TNFR family and the product of the downless gene, is able to co-precipitate ectodysplasin, confirming that they form a ligand-receptor pair. In situ hybridization and immunostaining studies show that ectodysplasin and EDAR are expressed in adjacent or partially overlapping layers in the developing human skin. We conclude that as a soluble ligand, ectodysplasin is able to interact with EDAR and mediate signals needed for the development of ectodermal appendages.',\n",

Here, we demonstrate that the fibronectin type III domain (FNIII) of RPTPbeta binds to glial tumor-derived cell lines and primary astrocytes. We used affinity purification to isolate several proteins that specifically bind to the FNIII domain of RPTPbeta. One of these, a 240 kDa protein that was purified from U118MG glioblastoma cell, was identified as tenascin C based on the amino acid sequence of several tryptic peptides. The interaction of RPTPbeta with tenascin C was found to mediate cell adhesion. Adhesion and spreading of SF763T astrocytoma cells expressing RPTPbeta on tenascin C was specifically abolished by the addition of a soluble fragment containing the FNIII domain of the receptor. RPTPbeta-dependent cell adhesion was mediated by binding to the alternatively spliced FNIII repeats A1,2,4 (TnfnA1,2,4) of tenascin C. Furthermore, COS cells expressing RPTPbeta adhere to TnfnA1,2,4, while the parental cells did not. These results demonstrate that the FNIII domain of RPTPbeta binds to tenascin C and suggest that RPTPbeta present on glial tumor cells is a primary adhesion receptor system to the extracellular matrix.',\n",

Herein we studied: 1) the binding of 125I-labeled human ghrelin to membranes from human hypothalamus and pituitary gland; 2) the ability of human ghrelin (either octanoylated or desoctanoylated), as well as of some GHS and neuropeptides to compete with the radioligand. The saturation binding analysis showed, in both tissues, the existence of a single class of high-affinity binding sites with limited binding capacity. The Bmax (maximal number of binding sites) values of ghrelin receptors in the hypothalamus were significantly greater (p<0.001) than those detected in the pituitary, whereas the Kd (dissociation constant) values in the two tissues were similar. 125I-ghrelin bound to hypothalamic membranes was displaced by ghrelin, hexarelin, MK-0677, various GHS antagonists (EP-80317, [D-Arg1-D-Phe5-D-Trp7,9-Leu11]-substance P) and some natural (cortistatin-14) and synthetic (vapreotide) SRIH-14 agonists. In contrast, no competition was seen in the presence of GHRH-44, SRIH-14 or desoctanoylated ghrelin, a ghrelin precursor that is devoid of GH-releasing properties. In conclusion, this preliminary study firstly demonstrates that ghrelin needs octanoylation to bind its hypothalamo-pituitary receptors. These receptors are the specific binding sites for GHS and their antagonists, as well as for SRIH analogs (vapreotide and cortistatin- 14), but not for native SRIH.',\n",
       " '11316806': \"Amyloid-beta, the pathologic protein in Alzheimer's disease, induces chemotaxis and production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytic cells, but mechanisms have not been fully defined. Here we provide three lines of evidence that the phagocyte G protein-coupled receptor (N-formylpeptide receptor 2 (FPR2)) mediates these amyloid-beta-dependent functions in phagocytic cells. First, transfection of FPR2, but not related receptors, including the other known N-formylpeptide receptor FPR, reconstituted amyloid-beta-dependent chemotaxis and calcium flux in HEK 293 cells. Second, amyloid-beta induced both calcium flux and chemotaxis in mouse neutrophils (which express endogenous FPR2) with similar potency as in FPR2-transfected HEK 293 cells. This activity could be specifically desensitized in both cell types by preincubation with a specific FPR2 agonist, which desensitizes the receptor, or with pertussis toxin, which uncouples it from G(i)-dependent signaling. Third, specific and reciprocal desensitization of superoxide production was observed when N-formylpeptides and amyloid-beta were used to sequentially stimulate neutrophils from FPR -/- mice, which express FPR2 normally. Potential biological relevance of these results to the neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease was suggested by two additional findings: first, FPR2 mRNA could be detected by PCR in mouse brain; second, induction of FPR2 expression correlated with induction of calcium flux and chemotaxis by amyloid-beta in the mouse microglial cell line N9. Further, in sequential stimulation experiments with N9 cells, N-formylpeptides and amyloid-beta were able to reciprocally cross-desensitize each other. Amyloid-beta was also a specific agonist at the human counterpart of FPR2, the FPR-like 1 receptor. These results suggest a unified signaling mechanism for linking amyloid-beta to phagocyte chemotaxis and oxidant stress in the brain.\",\n",

The KIR2DL1-HLA-Cw4 interface exhibits charge and shape complementarity. Specificity is mediated by a pocket in KIR2DL1 that hosts the Lys80 residue of HLA-Cw4. Many residues conserved in HLA-C and in KIR2DL receptors make different interactions in KIR2DL1-HLA-Cw4 and in a previously reported KIR2DL2-HLA-Cw3 complex. A dimeric aggregate of KIR-HLA-C complexes was observed in one KIR2DL1-HLA-Cw4 crystal.

NPY Y(1) antagonist BIBP3226 and mixed Y(1) antagonist/Y(4) agonist GR231118 are able to displace with low affinity, 50 -- 100 nM, the specific binding on NPFF receptors expressed in CHO cells as well as in rat dorsal spinal cord, an affinity however superior to those determined against Y(2), Y(4) or Y(5) receptors. Furthermore, BIBP3226 which is unable to inhibit the forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production mediated by NPFF(2) receptors, antagonizes the effect of NPFF, revealing the first antagonist of NPFF receptors.

Since recent studies showed that calreticulin interacts with integrin alpha subunit, we hypothesized that calreticulin may be involved in signal transduction of anti-alpha3 integrin antibody-mediated MMP-2 secretion and activation. Here we demonstrate that anti-alpha3 integrin antibody induced a transient enhanced interaction of calreticulin with alpha3 integrin. Transfection of antisense oligonucleotides of calreticulin in RD cells abrogated the interaction between calreticulin and alpha3 integrin, and completely suppressed activation of MMP-2 and enhanced secretion of proMMP-2 induced by anti-alpha3 integrin antibody. Transient overexpression of calreticulin cDNA in RD cells significantly increased secretion of proMMP-2.

Upon ligand binding, the receptor-ligand complex is endocytosed, and the ligand is released. The important biological role of the LDL receptor (LDLR) has been highlighted by the identification of more than 400 LDLR mutations that are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia. The extracellular region of the LDLR is modular in nature and principally comprises multiple copies of ligand binding, epidermal growth factor-like (EGF), and YWTD-type domains. This report describes characterization of the calcium binding properties of the tandem pair of EGF domains. While only the C-terminal EGF module contains the consensus sequence associated with calcium binding, a noncanonical calcium binding site in the N-terminal domain has been revealed using solution NMR spectroscopy. The calcium dissociation constants for the N- and C-terminal sites have been measured under physiologically relevant pH and ionic strength conditions using a combination of solution NMR, intrinsic protein fluorescence, and chromophoric chelator methods to be approximately 50 microM and approximately 10-20 microM, respectively. Identification of the novel calcium binding motif in LDLR sequences from other species suggests that it may confer specificity within the LDLR gene family. Comparison of the K(d) for the C-terminal site with the calcium concentration in late vesicles indicates that the binding properties of this module may be tuned to titrate upon endocytosis of the LDL receptor-ligand complex, and thus calcium binding may play a role in the ligand dissociation process.',\n",

Initial stress-induced responses provide a vital short-term metabolic lift, but prolonged or inappropriate exposure to stress can compromise homeostasis thereby leading to disease. This 'fight-or-flight' response is characterized by the activation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-adrenocorticotropin-glucocorticoid axis, mediated by the type 1 CRH receptor. In contrast, the type 2 CRH receptor mediates the stress-coping responses during the recovery phase of stress. We identified human stresscopin (SCP) and stresscopin-related peptide (SRP) as specific ligands for the type 2 CRH receptor. The genes encoding these peptides were expressed in diverse peripheral tissues as well as in the central nervous system. Treatment with SCP or SRP suppressed food intake, delayed gastric emptying and decreased heat-induced edema. Thus SCP and SRP might represent endogenous ligands for maintaining homeostasis after stress, and could allow the design of drugs to ameliorate stress-related diseases.\",\n",

Integrins, via interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM), control cell adhesion and motility. The two systems are functionally linked because uPAR and PAI-1 bind to the ECM component vitronectin (VN). Because integrin signaling alters gene expression patterns, we investigated whether the expression levels of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 are affected by ECM/integrin interactions. Expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 was significantly enhanced when human ovarian cancer cells (OV-MZ-6) were cultivated on fibronectin or collagen type IV. In contrast, VN induced down-regulation of uPA and uPAR while increasing PAI-1 by up to 4-fold. VN-dependent decrease of uPA protein was paralleled by a significant reduction of uPA promoter activity that was even more pronounced upon alpha(v)beta(3) overexpression and depended on the presence of intact Rel protein-binding sites. The activity of Rel transcription factors was also significantly reduced upon alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated cell adhesion to VN. The activity of the Rel-unresponsive PAI-1 promoter was up to 5-fold induced as a function of alpha(v)beta(3)/VN interaction. Thus, the balance between available concentrations of uPA, uPAR, PAI-1, and integrins in human ovarian cancer cells might provide a switch within the regulation of their invasive phenotype.',\n",

Like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF-C increases vascular permeability, stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and migration. In the present study, we investigated the expression of VEGF-C and its receptors VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 in normal and intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) placenta. Immunolocalisation studies showed that like VEGF and VEGFR-1, VEGF-C, VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 co-localised to the syncytiotrophoblast, to cells in the maternal decidua, as well as to the endothelium of the large placental blood vessels. Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in placental VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 protein expression in severe IUGR as compared to gestationally-matched third trimester pregnancies. Conditioned medium from VEGF-C producing pancreatic carcinoma (Suit-2) and endometrial epithelial (Hec-1B) cell lines caused an increased association of the phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) in VEGFR-3 immunoprecipitates from spontaneously transformed first trimester trophoblast cells. VEGF121 caused dose-dependant phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in trophoblast cells as well as stimulating DNA synthesis. In addition, premixing VEGF165 with heparin sulphate proteoglycan potentiated trophoblast proliferation and the association of phospho-ERK with the VEGFR-2 receptor. VEGF165-mediated DNA synthesis was inhibited by anti-VEGFR-2 neutralising antibody. The results demonstrate functional VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 receptors on trophoblast and suggest that the decreased expression of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 may contribute to the abnormal villous development observed in IUGR placenta.',\n",

The present study demonstrates that AGP binds specifically to MDM at high- and low-affinity binding sites with K(d) values of 16 nM and 4.9 microM respectively. The fact that heat denaturation of AGP only partly inhibited this binding (43%) suggests that protein-protein interactions are involved, as well as AGP glycans which are resistant to heat denaturation. Mannan, but not dextran, is a significant inhibitor (52%) of this binding, and sequential exoglycosidase treatment of AGP, which exposes penultimate mannose residues, has a strong stimulatory effect ( approximately 2.8-fold). Therefore AGP glycans (probably mannose residues) are involved, at least partly, in the binding of AGP to MDM. In addition, AGP inhibits the binding of V3Cs and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta) to MDM. The anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody 2D7, specific for the second extracellular loop of CCR5, also inhibited AGP binding (67%), whereas anti-CCR5 antibodies specific for the C-terminus of CCR5 region had no effect. Native AGP, like V3Cs (but not heat-denatured AGP), binds to 46 and 33-36 kDa electroblotted AGP-bound MDM membrane ligands, characterized as CCR5 by their interactions with anti-CCR5 antibodies and with MIP-1beta. Therefore both AGP glycans and MDM CCR5 are involved in the binding of AGP to MDM. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of AGP on the infection of human primary macrophages by R5 HIV-1 may be related to specific binding of AGP to a macrophage membrane lectin or lectin-like component and to CCR5.',\n",

In contrast, LRP-5 mutants lacking the extracellular domain functioned as constitutively active forms that bind Axin and that induce LEF-1 activation by destabilizing Axin and stabilizing beta-catenin. Addition of Wnt caused the translocation of Axin to the membrane and enhanced the interaction between Axin and LRP-5. In addition, the LRP-5 sequences involved in interactions with Axin are required for LEF-1 activation.

By the combination of gel filtration and EIA, we found that the molecular forms of apelin differ among respective tissues: apelin molecules with sizes close to apelin-36 (long forms) were major components in the lung, testis, and uterus, but both long and short (whose sizes were close to [<Glu(65)]apelin-13) forms were detected in the mammary gland.

This ligand had an equivalent high affinity for human oxytocin and V(1a) vasopressin receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Taking advantage of this dual specificity, we conducted photoaffinity labeling experiments on both receptors. Photolabeled oxytocin and V(1a) receptors appeared as a unique protein band at 70-75 kDa and two labeled protein bands at 85-90 and 46 kDa, respectively. To identify contact sites between the antagonist and the receptors, the labeled 70-75- and the 46-kDa proteins were cleaved with CNBr and digested with Lys-C and Arg-C endoproteinases. The fragmentation patterns allowed the identification of a covalently labeled region in the oxytocin receptor transmembrane domain III consisting of the residues Leu(114)-Val(115)-Lys(116). Analysis of contact sites in the V(1a) receptor led to the identification of the homologous region consisting of the residues Val(126)-Val(127)-Lys(128). Binding domains were confirmed by mutation of several CNBr cleavage sites in the oxytocin receptor and of one Lys-C cleavage site in the V(1a) receptor.

In situ hybridization on sections of human tonsil showed no ELC mRNA in HEVs, but immunostaining revealed ELC protein in cytoplasmic vesicles of HEV cells. Furthermore, ELC injected into the footpads of mice entered the draining lymph nodes and was presented by HEVs. Finally, intracutaneous injections of ELC in mice lacking functionally relevant ELC and SLC (plt/plt mice) restored T cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes as efficiently as SLC.

However, the decrease in Jagged1-triggered Notch2 signaling by mFng was again greater than that by lFng. Furthermore, we observed that each fringe protein acted on a different site of the extracellular region of Notch2. Taking these findings together, we propose that the difference in modulatory function of multiple fringe proteins may result from the distinct amino acid sequence specificity targeted by these glycosyltransferases.',\n",
       " '11353828': 'The integrin alphaLbeta2 has three different domains in its headpiece that have been suggested to either bind ligand or to regulate ligand binding. One of these, the inserted or I domain, has a fold similar to that of small G proteins. The I domain of the alphaM and alpha2 subunits has been crystallized in both open and closed conformations; however, the alphaL I domain has been crystallized in only the closed conformation. We hypothesized that the alphaL domain also would have an open conformation, and that this would be the ligand binding conformation. Therefore, we introduced pairs of cysteine residues to form disulfides that would lock the alphaL I domain in either the open or closed conformation. Locking the I domain open resulted in a 9,000-fold increase in affinity to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which was reversed by disulfide reduction. By contrast, the affinity of the locked closed conformer was similar to wild type. Binding completely depended on Mg(2+). Orders of affinity were ICAM-1 > ICAM-2 > ICAM-3. The k(on), k(off), and K(D) values for the locked open I domain were within 1.5-fold of values previously determined for the alphaLbeta2 complex, showing that the I domain is sufficient for full affinity binding to ICAM-1. The locked open I domain antagonized alphaLbeta2-dependent adhesion in vitro, lymphocyte homing in vivo, and firm adhesion but not rolling on high endothelial venules. The ability to reversibly lock a protein fold in an active conformation with dramatically increased affinity opens vistas in therapeutics and proteomics.',\n",

Distinct prolactin receptor isoforms, having different cytoplasmic domains generated by alternative splicing, are expressed as development proceeds at different levels in different organs. The \"long\" receptors are able to mediate transduction of all signals examined, in contrast with the \"short\" isoforms, whose truncated cytoplasmic domains are able to mediate a much smaller repertoire of signals and can act as dominant negatives. Our studies demonstrate that, although these forms share internalization mechanisms, the long form is internalized faster, resulting in more rapid down-regulation of this form. In order to examine the mechanisms by which prolactin may exert trophic effects on its target tissues during development, we have examined the signalling pathways through which prolactin binding to the long receptor regulates the transcription of cyclin D1. Our studies reveal the importance of the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transduction and activators of transcription) pathway, and the complexity of prolactin signalling to this promoter.',\n",
       " '11356985': 'Proteinase-activated receptors are a recently described, novel family of seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors. Rather then being stimulated through ligand receptor occupancy, activation is initiated by cleavage of the N terminus of the receptor by a serine protease resulting in the generation of a new tethered ligand that interacts with the receptor within extracellular loop-2. To date, four proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) have been identified, with distinct N-terminal cleavage sites and tethered ligand pharmacology. In addition to the progress in the generation of PAR-1 antagonists, we describe the role of thrombin in such processes as wound healing and the evidence implicating PAR-1 in vascular disorders and cancer. We also identify advances in the understanding of PAR-1-mediated intracellular signaling and receptor desensitization. The cellular functions, signaling events, and desensitization processes involved in PAR-2 activation are also assessed. However, other major aspects of PAR-2 are highlighted, in particular the ability of several serine protease enzymes, in addition to trypsin, to function as activators of PAR-2. The likely physiological and pathophysiological roles for PAR-2 in skin, intestine, blood vessels, and the peripheral nervous system are considered in the context of PAR-2 activation by multiple serine proteases. The recent discovery of PAR-3 and PAR-4 as additional thrombin-sensitive PARs further highlights the complexity in assessing the effects of thrombin in several different systems, an issue that remains to be fully addressed. These discoveries have also highlighted possible PAR-PAR interactions at both functional and molecular levels. The future identification of other PARs and their modes of activation are an important future direction for this expanding field of study.',\n",

They signal through frizzled-type seven-transmembrane-domain receptors to stabilize beta-catenin. Wnt signalling is antagonized by the extracellular Wnt inhibitor dickkopf1 (dkk1), which is a member of a multigene family. dkk1 was initially identified as a head inducer in Xenopus embryos but the mechanism by which it blocks Wnt signalling is unknown. LDL-receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is required during Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in Drosophila, Xenopus and mouse, possibly acting as a co-receptor for Wnt. Here we show that LRP6 (ref. 7) is a specific, high-affinity receptor for Dkk1 and Dkk2. Dkk1 blocks LRP6-mediated Wnt/beta-catenin signalling by interacting with domains that are distinct from those required for Wnt/Frizzled interaction. dkk1 and LRP6 interact antagonistically during embryonic head induction in Xenopus where LRP6 promotes the posteriorizing role of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Thus, DKKs inhibit Wnt co-receptor function, exemplifying the modulation of LRP signalling by antagonists.',\n",

We now present evidence that MMP-1 binds the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin via the I domain of the alpha(2) integrin subunit. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with purified human MMP-1 and recombinant alpha(2) integrin I domain, we showed that the alpha(2) integrin I domain specifically bound in a divalent cation-dependent manner to both the pro and active forms of MMP-1, but not to MMP-3 or MMP-13. Although both the I domain and MMP-1 bind divalent cations, MMP-1 bound, in a divalent cation-dependent manner, to alpha(2) integrin I domains containing metal ion-dependent adhesion sites motif mutations that prevent divalent cation binding to the I domain, demonstrating that the metal ion dependence is a function of MMP-1. Using a series of MMP-1-MMP-3 and MMP-1-MMP-13 chimeras, we determined that both the linker domain and the hemopexin-like domain of MMP-1 were required for optimal binding to the I domain. The alpha(2) integrin/MMP-1 interaction described here extends an emerging paradigm in matrix biology involving anchoring of proteinases to the cell surface to regulate their biological activities.',\n",

This site-specific expression is regulated by binding of the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin with dermal type I collagen, and the catalytic activity of MMP-1 is required for keratinocyte migration. Because of this functional association among substrate/ligand, receptor, and proteinase, we assessed whether the integrin also directs the compartmentalization of MMP-1 to its matrix target. Indeed, pro-MMP-1 co-localized to sites of alpha(2)beta(1) contacts in migrating keratinocytes. Furthermore, pro-MMP-1 co-immunoprecipitated with alpha(2)beta(1) from keratinocytes, and alpha(2)beta(1) co-immunoprecipitated with pro-MMP-1. No other MMPs bound alpha(2)beta(1), and no other integrins interacted with MMP-1. Pro-MMP-1 also provided a substrate for alpha(2)beta(1)-dependent adhesion of platelets. Complex formation on keratinocytes was most efficient on native type I collagen and reduced or ablated on denatured or cleaved collagen. Competition studies suggested that the alpha(2) I domain interacts with the linker and hemopexin domains of pro-MMP-1, not with the pro-domain. These data indicate that the interaction of pro-MMP-1 with alpha(2)beta(1) confines this proteinase to points of cell contact with collagen and that the ternary complex of integrin, enzyme, and substrate function together to drive and regulate keratinocyte migration.',\n",

N6-Cyclopentyladenosine on uncapacitated spermatozoa did not induce spontaneous acrosome reaction after 5 h capacitation, whereas the number of capacitated spermatozoa, assessed by lysophosphatidylcholine-induced acrosome reaction with Pisum sativum agglutinin staining, was significantly increased. N6-Cyclopentyladenosine was also added to capacitated human spermatozoa to find out whether the agonist could induce the acrosome reaction. Results, although statistically significant, could not be considered biologically significant. A1-Mediated capacitation was followed by the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein subset ranging between M(r) = 200 000 and 30 000. Stimulation of A1 receptor with the selective agonist elicited an agonist-induced inositol phospholipid hydrolysis leading to a transient rise of inositol triphosphate (IP3). This increase was not induced by A(1) receptor antagonist and was blocked by phospholipase C inhibitor. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that the A(1) receptor is coupled to Galphai2 subunit suggesting that the activation of phospholipase C is mediated by betagamma subunits. In conclusion, the A(1) adenosine receptor in human spermatozoa is coupled to Galphai2, signals via IP3, and affects the capacitative status of ejaculated spermatozoa.',\n",

The alpha chains of laminins have been shown to have various biological activities. In this study, we identified a sequence of the alpha 3 chain C-terminal globular domain (LG1-LG5 modules) required for both heparin binding and cell adhesion using recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides. We found that the LG3 and LG4 modules have activity for heparin binding and that LG4 has activity for cell adhesion. Studies with synthetic peptides delineated the A3G75aR sequence (NSFMALYLSKGR, residues 1412--1423) within LG4 as a major site for both heparin and cell binding. Substitution mutations in LG4 and A3G75aR identified the Lys and Arg of the A3G75aR sequence as critical for these activities. Cell adhesion to LG4 and A3G75aR was inhibited by heparitinase I treatment of cells, suggesting that cell binding to the A3G75aR site was mediated by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. We showed by affinity chromatography that syndecan-2 from fibroblasts bound to LG4. Solid-phase assays confirmed that syndecan-2 interacted with the A3G75aR peptide sequence. Stably transfected 293T cells with expression vectors for syndecan-2 and -4, but not glypican-1, specifically adhered to LG4 and A3G75aR. These results indicate that the A3G75aR sequence within the laminin alpha 3 LG4 module is responsible for cell adhesion and suggest that syndecan-2 and -4 mediate this activity.',\n",

Starting from the dodecapeptide MCH(6 - 17), we found that: (1) substitution of Tyr(13) by a Phe residue; (2) addition of a 3-iodo-Tyr residue at the N-terminus; and (3) addition of a hydrophilic spacer 8-amino-3,6-dioxyoctanoyl between the 3-iodo-Tyr and MCH(6 - 17) (compound S36057), led to an agonist more potent than MCH itself in stimulating [35S]-GTPgammaS binding at membranes from HEK293 cells stably expressing the human MCH receptor. Specific binding of [125I]-S36057 was found in HEK293 and CHO cell lines stably expressing the human MCH receptor. This radioligand recognized a similar number of binding sites (ca. 800 fmol mg(-1)) than [125I]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH. However, the K(D) for [125I]-S36057 obtained from saturation studies (0.037 nM) or from binding kinetics (0.046 nM) was at least 10 fold higher to that of [125I]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH (0.46 nM). Affinities determined for a series of MCH analogues were similar with both radioligands, S36057 being the most potent compound tested (K(i)=0.053 nM). Finally, [125I]-S36057 also potently labelled the MCH receptor in membranes from whole rat brain (K(D) 0.044 nM, B(max)=11 fmol mg(-1)). In conclusion, [125I]-S36057 is a more potent and more stable radioligand than [125I]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH that will represent a reliable tool for binding assays in the search of novel MCH ligands.

To characterize these interactions in more detail, recombinant human Slit-2 protein and the N- and C-terminal portions generated by in vivo proteolytic processing were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the binding of a glypican-Fc fusion protein. Saturable and reversible high affinity binding to the full-length protein and to the C-terminal portion that is released from the cell membrane was seen, with dissociation constants in the 80-110 nm range, whereas only a relatively low level of binding to the larger N-terminal segment was detected. Co-transfection of 293 cells with Slit and glypican-1 cDNAs followed by immunoprecipitation demonstrated that these interactions also occur in vivo, and immunocytochemical studies showed colocalization in the embryonic and adult central nervous system. The binding affinity of the glypican core protein to Slit is an order of magnitude lower than that of the glycanated proteoglycan. Glypican binding to Slit was also decreased 80--90% by heparin (2 microg/ml), enzymatic removal of the heparan sulfate chains, and by chlorate inhibition of glypican sulfation. The differential effects of N- or O-desulfated heparin on glypican binding also indicate that O-sulfate groups on the heparan sulfate chains play a critical role in heparin interactions with Slit. Our data suggest that glypican binding to the releasable C-terminal portion of Slit may serve as a mechanism for regulating the biological activity of Slit and/or the proteoglycan.',\n",

Latency-associated protein (LAP), the N-terminal remnant of the TGF-beta precursor, is able to bind and neutralize TGF-beta. Mature TGF-beta exerts its activity by binding and complexing members of two subfamilies of receptors, the type I and II receptors. In addition to these signaling receptors, TGF-beta can also interact with an accessory receptor termed the type III receptor. Using a surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor (BIAcore), we determined the mechanisms of interaction of four binding proteins (LAP, the type II and III receptor ectodomains (EDs), and a type II receptor ED/Fc chimera) with three TGF-beta isoforms, and we quantified their related kinetic parameters. Using global fitting based on a numerical integration data analysis method, we demonstrated that LAP and the type II receptor/Fc chimera interacted with the TGF-beta isoforms with a 1:1 stoichiometry. In contrast, the type II ED interactions with TGF-beta were best fit by a kinetic model assuming the presence of two independent binding sites on the ligand molecule. We also showed that the type III ED bound two TGF-beta molecules. Further experiments revealed that LAP was able to block the interactions of TGF-beta with the two EDs, but that the two EDs did not compete or cooperate with each other. Together, these results strongly support the existence of a cell-surface complex consisting of one type III receptor, two TGF-beta molecules, and four type II receptors, prior to the recruitment of the type I receptor for signal transduction. Additionally, our results indicate that the apparent dissociation rate constants are more predictive of the neutralizing potency of these TGF-beta-binding proteins (LAP, the type II and III receptor EDs, and the type II receptor/Fc chimera) than the apparent equilibrium constants.',\n",

TR6 can bind to FasL and prevent FasL-induced apoptosis; it can also associate with LIGHT, another TNF family member. The role of TR6 in immune responses was investigated in this study. According to flow cytometry, recombinant human TR6-Fc binds to human LIGHT expressed on 293 cells or on activated human T cells and competes with the LIGHT receptor TR2 for the binding to LIGHT on these cells. Human TR6 could cross-react with mouse LIGHT in immunoprecipitation. TR6-Fc also downregulates cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in vitro and graft-versus-host responses in mice. Moreover, TR6-Fc modulates lymphokine production by alloantigen-stimulated mouse T cells. TR6-Fc ameliorated rejection response to mouse heart allograft. These results indicate that TR6 can dampen T-cell responses to alloantigens. Such regulatory effects of TR6 probably occur via interference with interaction between pairs of related TNF and TNFR family members, LIGHT/TR2 being one of the possible candidate pairs.',\n",

Also, BMP-6 induces osteoblastic differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells and is an autocrine stimulator of chondrocyte differentiation. The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of BMP-6 on human cobblestone-area-forming cells (CAFC), that represent the functional primitive repopulating haemopoietic stem cell in long-term bone marrow culture. Also, the effect of BMP-6 on marrow stroma production of interleukin-6, -11 and their common receptor gp130 that is expressed in haemopoietic stem cells and is indispensable for their proliferation and tri-lineage differentiation was examined. Moreover, the effect of BMP-6 on marrow stroma release of soluble adhesion molecule VCAM-1 mediating the primitive haemopoietic stem cell adhesion to marrow stroma was examined. The number of CAFC was significantly reduced after BMP-6 treatment from 88+/-10 per 10(5)cells in control cultures in a dose dependent manner to only 48+/-3 per 10(5)cells in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated cultures, P< 0.01. Quantitative ELISA measurement revealed 50 ng/ml BMP-6 was able to significantly reduce IL-6 and IL-11 production from marrow stroma, P< 0.01. Also, BMP-6 significantly increased soluble gp130 release by 7.4-fold in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated marrow stroma cultures. The profound rapid increase in this natural antagonist of human IL-6 cytokine family may reduce the gp130 signaling. Also, the soluble VCAM-1 released increased by two-fold in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated marrow stroma cultures. The marked increase in the soluble form may exert an antagonist effect on the function of VCAM-1 (ligand for VLA4).

Also, we previously observed a significantly lower expression of VLA4 (CD49d) on G-CSF-mobilised blood CD34 positive cells than on bone marrow CD34 positive cells before mobilisation in the same normal donors. Since BMP are currently being used in clinical trials for bone repair and fracture healing, the present results suggest a possible role for BMP-6 in mobilising CD34 positive cells for transplantation.

Though it is known that a glycoform of PSGL-1 (CLA) functions as the principal E-selectin ligand on human T lymphocytes, the E-selectin ligand(s) of human HPCs has not been identified. We used a shear-based adherence assay to analyze and define the E-selectin ligand activity of membrane proteins from human HPCs. Our data show that PSGL-1 expressed on human HPCs is an E-selectin ligand, and that HPCs also express a previously unrecognized E-selectin ligand, CD44. The E-selectin ligand activity of CD44 is conferred by the elaboration of sialylated, fucosylated binding determinants on N-glycans. This glycoform of CD44 is expressed on primitive CD34+ human HPCs, but not on more mature hematopoietic cells. Under physiologic flow conditions, this molecule mediates E-selectin-dependent rolling interactions over a wider shear range than that of PSGL-1, and promotes human HPC rolling interactions on E-selectin expressed on human BM endothelial cells.

We determined a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 62 microm, which resembles the affinity of L-selectin binding to glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1. The affinity of the E-selectin-ESL-1 interaction did not change significantly when the temperature was varied from 5 degrees C to 37 degrees C, indicating that the enthalpic contribution to the binding is small at physiological temperatures, and that, in contrast to typical protein-carbohydrate interactions, binding is driven primarily by favorable entropic changes. Interestingly, surface plasmon resonance experiments with recombinant ESL-1 from alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferase IV-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells showed a very similar K(d) of 66 microm, suggesting that this fucosyltransferase is sufficient to produce fully functional recombinant ESL-1. Following the recent description of the affinity and kinetics of the selectin-ligand pairs L-selectin-glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 and P-selectin-P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, this is the first determination of the parameters of E-selectin binding to one of its naturally occurring ligands.',\n",

We hereby report the identification of a second human MCH receptor termed MCH-2R, which shares about 38% amino acid identity with MCH-1R. MCH-2R displayed high-affinity MCH binding, resulting in inositol phosphate turnover and release of intracellular calcium in mammalian cells. In contrast to MCH-1R, MCH-2R signaling is not sensitive to pertussis toxin and MCH-2R cannot reduce forskolin-stimulated cAMP production, suggesting an exclusive G(alpha)q coupling of the MCH-2R in cell-based systems. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of human and monkey tissue shows that expression of MCH-2R mRNA is restricted to several regions of the brain, including the arcuate nucleus and the ventral medial hypothalamus, areas implicated in regulation of body weight. In addition, the human MCH-2R gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6 at band 6q16.2-16.3, a region reported to be associated with cytogenetic abnormalities of obese patients.

Typical Y(2) agonists (PYY(3-36), NPY(3-36), NPY(13-36), C2-NPY) and very short PYY analogs (N-alpha-Ac-PYY(22-36) and N-alpha-Ac-PYY(25-36)) acting at the intestinal PYY receptor were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of (125)I-PYY to membranes of rat intestinal crypt cells and of CHO cells stably transfected with the rat hippocampal Y(2) receptor cDNA. Similar PYY preference was observed and all analogs exhibited comparable high affinity in both binding assays. The same held true for the specific Y(2) antagonist BIIE0246 with a K(i) value of 6.5 and 9.0 nM, respectively. BIIE0246 completely abolished the inhibition of cAMP production by PYY in crypt cells and transfected CHO cells. Moreover, the antagonist 1) considerably reversed the PYY-induced reduction of short-circuit current in rat jejunum mucosa in Ussing chamber and 2) completely abolished the antisecretory action of PYY on vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-induced fluid secretion in rat jejunum in vivo. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments showed that Y(2) receptor transcripts were present in intestinal crypt cells (3 x 10(2) molecules/100 ng RNA(T)) with no expression in villus cells, in complete agreement with the exclusive binding of PYY in crypt cells. Finally, a full-length Y(2) receptor was cloned by RT-PCR from rat intestinal crypt cells and also from human small intestine.

Here we report that expression of EphA8 in either NIH 3T3 or HEK293 cells enhanced cell adhesion to fibronectin via alpha(5)beta(1)- or beta(3) integrins. Interestingly, a kinase-inactive EphA8 mutant also markedly promoted cell attachment to fibronectin in these cell lines. Using a panel of EphA8 point mutants, we have demonstrated that EphA8 kinase activity does not correlate with its ability to promote cell attachment to fibronectin. Analysis using EphA8 extracellular and intracellular domain mutants has revealed that enhanced cell adhesion is dependent on ephrin A binding to the extracellular domain and the juxtamembrane segment of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. EphA8-promoted adhesion was efficiently inhibited by wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor. Additionally, we found that EphA8 had associated PI 3-kinase activity and that the p110gamma isoform of PI 3-kinase is associated with EphA8. In vitro binding experiments revealed that the EphA8 juxtamembrane segment was sufficient for the formation of a stable complex with p110gamma. Similar results were obtained in assay using cells stripped of endogenous ephrin A ligands by treatment with preclustered ephrin A5-Fc proteins. In addition, a membrane-targeted lipid kinase-inactive p110gamma mutant was demonstrated to stably associate with EphA8 and suppress EphA8-promoted cell adhesion to fibronectin. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of a novel mechanism by which the EphA8 receptor localizes p110gamma PI 3-kinase to the plasma membrane in a tyrosine kinase-independent fashion, thereby allowing access to lipid substrates to enable the signals required for integrin-mediated cell adhesion.',\n",

The mammalian peptides signal through two G protein-coupled receptor types to modulate endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stress, as well as a range of peripheral (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and immune) activities. The three previously known ligands are differentially distributed anatomically and have distinct specificities for the two major receptor types. Here we describe the characterization of an additional CRF-related peptide, urocortin III, in the human and mouse. In searching the public human genome databases we found a partial expressed sequence tagged (EST) clone with significant sequence identity to mammalian and fish urocortin-related peptides. By using primers based on the human EST sequence, a full-length human clone was isolated from genomic DNA that encodes a protein that includes a predicted putative 38-aa peptide structurally related to other known family members. With a human probe, we then cloned the mouse ortholog from a genomic library. Human and mouse urocortin III share 90% identity in the 38-aa putative mature peptide. In the peptide coding region, both human and mouse urocortin III are 76% identical to pufferfish urocortin-related peptide and more distantly related to urocortin II, CRF, and urocortin from other mammalian species. Mouse urocortin III mRNA expression is found in areas of the brain including the hypothalamus, amygdala, and brainstem, but is not evident in the cerebellum, pituitary, or cerebral cortex; it is also expressed peripherally in small intestine and skin. Urocortin III is selective for type 2 CRF receptors and thus represents another potential endogenous ligand for these receptors.',\n",

An orphan G protein-coupled receptor (SLC-1/GPR24) has recently been identified as a receptor for MCH (MCHR1). We report here the identification and characterization of a G protein-coupled receptor as the MCH receptor subtype 2 (MCHR2). MCHR2 has higher protein sequence homology to MCHR1 than any other G protein-coupled receptor. The expression of MCHR2 has been detected in many regions of the brain. In contrast to MCHR1, which is intronless in the coding region and is located at the chromosomal locus 22q13.3, the MCHR2 gene has multiple exons and is mapped to locus 6q21. MCHR2 is specifically activated by nanomolar concentrations of MCH, binds to MCH with high affinity, and signals through Gq protein. This discovery is important for a full understanding of MCH biology and the development of potential therapeutics for diseases involving MCH, including obesity.',\n",

The EST has approximately 32% identity to the extracellular domain of FGFR1-4. Library screening with this EST identified two full-length alternative transcripts which we designated as FGFR5 beta and FGFR5 gamma. The main difference between these transcripts is that FGFR5 beta contains three extracellular Ig domains whereas FGFR5 gamma contains only two. A unique feature of FGFR5 is that it does not contain an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Predictive structural modelling of the extracellular domain of FGFR5 gamma suggested that it was a member of the I-set subgroup of the Ig-superfamily, consistent with the known FGFRs. Northern analysis of mouse and human FGFR5 showed detectable mRNA in a broad range of tissues, including kidney, brain and lung. Genomic sequencing identified four introns but identified no alternative transcripts containing a tyrosine kinase domain. Extracellular regions of FGFR5 beta and 5 gamma were cloned in-frame with the Fc fragment of human IgG(1) to generate recombinant non-membrane bound protein. Recombinant FGFR5 beta Fc and R5 gamma Fc demonstrated specific binding to the ligand FGF-2, but not FGF-7 or EGF. However, biological data suggest that FGF-2 binding to these proteins is with lower affinity than its cognate receptor FGFR2C.

Although IL-21 binds to the IL-21R expressed on gamma(c)-deficient ED40515(-) cells, IL-21 is unable to transduce any intracytoplasmic signals. However, in EDgamma-16 cells, a gamma(c)-transfected ED40515(-) cell line, IL-21 binds to the IL-21R and can activate Janus kinase (JAK)1, JAK3, STAT1, and STAT3.

Cells transfected with both receptor subunits proliferated in response to purified, recombinant human TSLP, with induced phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5. Human TSLPR and IL-7Ralpha are principally coexpressed on monocytes and dendritic cell populations and to a much lesser extent on various lymphoid cells. In accord, we find that human TSLP functions mainly on myeloid cells; it induces the release of T cell-attracting chemokines from monocytes and, in particular, enhances the maturation of CD11c(+) dendritic cells, as evidenced by the strong induction of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80 and the enhanced capacity to elicit proliferation of naive T cells.',\n",

Several integrins including alpha(v)beta(3) can bind to multiple ligands. The binding of alpha(v)beta(3) to fibronectin and vitronectin was used as a model to determine whether the same or distinct forms of the receptor were utilized in strong binding to the two different ligands. A spinning-disc device was used to measure the relative strength of the alpha(v)beta(3)-ligand bonds. The initial binding reaction for both ligands occurred in the absence of metabolic energy and resulted in a strong adhesion to fibronectin but a weak adhesion to vitronectin. Increases in the strength of the alpha(v)beta(3)-vitronectin bond required phosphorylation of the beta(3) cytoplasmic domain, intracellular signals, and the binding of cytoskeletal proteins to cytoplasmic domains of beta(3) controlled by Tyr-747 and Tyr-759. In contrast, alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion to fibronectin was unaffected by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, mutations of Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 to phenylalanine, or availability of metabolic energy. This suggests that strong adhesion to fibronectin used the initial binding conformation, whereas strong binding to vitronectin required signaling-induced changes in the conformation of alpha(v)beta(3).',\n",

To understand the molecular basis for the interaction, an extensive mutagenesis study of fractalkine's chemokine domain was undertaken. The results reveal a cluster of basic residues (Lys-8, Lys-15, Lys-37, Arg-45, and Arg-48) and one aromatic (Phe-50) that are critical for binding and/or signaling. The mutant R48A could bind but not induce chemotaxis, demonstrating that Arg-48 is a signaling trigger. This result also shows that signaling residues are not confined to chemokine N termini, as generally thought. F50A showed no detectable binding, underscoring its importance to the stability of the complex. K15A displayed unique signaling characteristics, eliciting a wild-type calcium flux but minimal chemotaxis, suggesting that this mutant can activate some, but not all, pathways required for migration. Fractalkine also binds the human cytomegalovirus receptor US28, and analysis of the mutants indicates that US28 recognizes many of the same epitopes of fractalkine as CX3CR1. Comparison of the binding surfaces of fractalkine and the CC chemokine MCP-1 reveals structural details that may account for their dual recognition by US28 and their selective recognition by host receptors.\",\n",

K. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15314-15320). In this study, we determined subcellular localization of COX-2 and caveolin-1 by confocal microscopy. COX-2 in human foreskin fibroblasts stimulated by PMA (100 nm) or interleukin-1beta (1 ng/ml) for 6 h was localized to plasma membrane in addition to endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Caveolin-1 was localized to plasma membrane, and image overlay showed colocalization of COX-2 with caveolin-1. This was confirmed by the presence of COX-2 and caveolin-1 in the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction of cells stimulated by PMA. Immunoprecipitation showed complex formation of COX-2 with caveolin-1 in a time-dependent manner. A larger quantity of COX-2 was complexed with caveolin-1 in PMA-treated than in interleukin-1beta-treated cells. Purified COX-2 complexed with glutathione S-transferase-fused caveolin-1, which was not inhibited by the scaffolding domain peptide. Caveolin-1-bound COX-2 was catalytically active, and its activity was not inhibited by the scaffolding domain peptide. These results suggest that COX-2 induced by PMA and interleukin-1beta is colocalized with caveolin-1 in the segregated caveolae compartment. Because caveolae are rich in signaling molecules, this COX-2 compartment may play an important role in diverse pathophysiological processes.',\n",

Secreted antagonists of Wnt include Frizzled (Fz)-related proteins (FRPs), Cerberus, Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF) and Dickkopf (Dkk). FRPs, Cerberus and WIF have all been shown to act by binding and sequestering Wnt. We report a novel mechanism of Wnt-signalling inhibition by human Dkk-1. Dkk-1 demonstrated no interaction with Wnt but bound a single cell surface site with high affinity (K(D) = 0.39 nM). Its receptor was detectable in a complex with a relative molecular mass of 240,000 (M(r) 240K) with [(125)I] Dkk-1 by covalent affinity cross-linking. Wnt signalling through beta-catenin is mediated by the Fz receptor and a recently identified low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related co-receptor, LRP6/Arrow. Overproduction of the 200K LRP6 protein, but not of Fz, strikingly increased Dkk-1 binding as well as the amount of the 240K cross-linked complex, which was shown to be composed of Dkk-1 and LRP6. Moreover, Dkk-1 function was completely independent of Fz but LRP6 dramatically interfered with the Dkk-1 inhibition of Wnt signalling. Thus, unlike Wnt antagonists, which exert their effects by molecular mimicry of Fz or Wnt sequestration through other mechanisms, Dkk-1 specifically inhibits canonical Wnt signalling by binding to the LRP6 component of the receptor complex.',\n",

To begin to address the function of this molecule, ligands for ICAM-4 on hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cell lines were identified. Peptide inhibition studies suggest that adhesion of cell lines to an ICAM-4-Fc construct is mediated by an LDV-inhibitable integrin on hemopoietic cells and an RGD-inhibitable integrin on nonhemopoietic cells. Antibody inhibition studies identified the hemopoietic integrin as alpha(4)beta(1.) Antibody inhibition studies on alpha(4)beta(1)-negative, nonhemopoietic cell lines suggested that adhesion of these cells is mediated by alpha(V) integrins (notably alpha(V)beta(1) and alpha(V)beta(5)). The structure of ICAM-4 modeled on the crystal structure of ICAM-2 was used to identify surface-exposed amino acid residues for site-directed mutagenesis. Neither an unusual LETS nor an LDV motif in the first domain of ICAM-4 was critical for integrin binding. ICAM-4 is the first ICAM family member shown to be a ligand for integrins other than those of the beta(2) family, and the data suggest that ICAM-4 has a novel integrin-binding site(s). These findings suggest a role for ICAM-4 in normal erythropoiesis and may also be relevant to the adhesive interactions of sickle cells.',\n",

Based on sequence homology to the CD155 gene, three poliovirus receptor-related genes (PRR1, PRR2, and PRR3) were cloned recently. PRR proteins were reported by others to mediate homophilic cell adhesion. Neither PRR1 nor PRR2 binds poliovirus and it is assumed that their physiological functions differ from that of CD155. Indeed, mPRR2 was found to bind to vitronectin only weakly, while its self-adhesion activity is characterized by a K(d) of 310 nM. Moreover, there is no evidence for CD155 self-adhesion.

The differing migratory abilities correlated with higher levels of mRNA encoding the lymphotactin receptor (XCR1) on the CD62L(lo) cells compared to the CD62L(hi) cells.

Recently, vertebrate orthologues of two of these proteins, ASIP/PAR-3 and PAR-6, were found to form a signalling complex with the small GTPases Cdc42/Rac1 and with atypical protein kinase C (PKC). Here we show that ASIP/PAR-3 associates with the tight-junction-associated protein junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) in vitro and in vivo. No binding was observed with claudin-1, -4 or -5. In fibroblasts and CHO cells overexpressing JAM, endogenous ASIP is recruited to JAM at sites of cell-cell contact. Over expression of truncated JAM lacking the extracellular part disrupts ASIP/PAR-3 localization at intercellular junctions and delays ASIP/PAR-3 recruitment to newly formed cell junctions. During junction formation, JAM appears early in primordial forms of junctions. Our data suggest that the ASIP/PAR-3-aPKC complex is tethered to tight junctions via its association with JAM, indicating a potential role for JAM in the generation of cell polarity in epithelial cells.',\n",

LD78beta(3 - 70) competed tenfold more efficiently than LD78beta(1 - 70) with [125I] RANTES for binding to the CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR1. Contrary to LD78alpha, LD78beta(1 - 70) at 30 ng/ml efficiently competed with [125I] RANTES for binding to CCR3 and mobilized calcium in CCR3 transfectants, whereas LD78beta(3 - 70) showed a 30-fold decrease in CCR3 affinity compared to LD78beta(1 - 70). This demonstrates the importance of the penultimate proline in LD78beta(1 - 70) for CCR3 recognition. Both LD78beta isoforms efficiently chemoattracted eosinophils from responsive donors. In contrast, only the CCR3 agonist LD78beta(1 - 70) and not LD78beta(3 - 70), induced calcium increases in eosinophils with low levels of CCR1. In responder neutrophils, LD78beta(3 - 70) elicited calcium fluxes at a 30-fold lower dose (10 ng/ml) compared to intact LD78beta and LD78alpha, whereas the three MIP-1alpha isoforms were equipotent neutrophil chemoattractants.

To identify possible myostatin inhibitors that may have applications for promoting muscle growth, we investigated the regulation of myostatin signaling. Myostatin protein purified from mammalian cells consisted of a noncovalently held complex of the N-terminal propeptide and a disulfide-linked dimer of C-terminal fragments. The purified C-terminal myostatin dimer was capable of binding the activin type II receptors, Act RIIB and, to a lesser extent, Act RIIA. Binding of myostatin to Act RIIB could be inhibited by the activin-binding protein follistatin and, at higher concentrations, by the myostatin propeptide. To determine the functional significance of these interactions in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing high levels of the propeptide, follistatin, or a dominant-negative form of Act RIIB by using a skeletal muscle-specific promoter. Independent transgenic mouse lines for each construct exhibited dramatic increases in muscle mass comparable to those seen in myostatin knockout mice.

Although unactivated platelets express numerous copies of GPIIb-IIIa on their surface, spontaneous, and potentially deleterious, platelet aggregation is prevented by tightly regulating the fibrinogen binding activity of GPIIb-IIIa. Preliminary evidence suggests that it is the submembranous actin or actin-associated proteins that constrains GPIIb-IIIa in a low affinity state and that relief of this constraint by initiating actin filament turnover enables GPIIb-IIIa to bind fibrinogen. Two regions of the fibrinogen alpha chain that contain an RGD motif, as well as the carboxyl-terminus of the fibrinogen gamma chain, represent potential binding sites for GPIIb-IIIa in the fibrinogen molecule. However, ultrastructural studies using purified fibrinogen and GPIIb-IIIa, and studies using recombinant fibrinogen in which the RGD and relevant gamma chain motifs were mutated indicate that sequences located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the gamma chain mediates fibrinogen binding to GPIIb-IIIa. There is evidence that fibrinogen itself binds to regions in the amino terminal portions of both GPIIb and GPIIIa and that the sites interacting with the fibrinogen gamma chain and with RGD-containing peptides are spatially distinct. Nonetheless, there appears to be allosteric linkage between these sites, accounting for the ability of RGD-containing peptides to inhibit platelet aggregation and arterial thrombosis.',\n",

In extension, quantitative real-time PCR revealed that of human skin-derived cells, only keratinocytes but not fibroblasts, endothelial cells, or melanocytes express IL-1delta and epsilon. Levels of keratinocyte IL-1delta are approximately 10-fold higher than those of IL-1epsilon. In vitro stimulation of keratinocytes with IL-1beta/TNF-alpha significantly up-regulates the expression of IL-1epsilon mRNA, and to a lesser extent of IL-1delta mRNA. In NF-kappaB-luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated that IL-1delta and epsilon proteins do not initiate a functional response via classical IL-1R pairs, which confer responsiveness to IL-1alpha and beta or IL-18. However, IL-1epsilon activates NF-kappaB through the orphan IL-1R-related protein 2 (IL-1Rrp2), whereas IL-1delta, which shows striking homology to IL-1 receptor antagonist, specifically and potently inhibits this IL-1epsilon response. In lesional psoriasis skin, characterized by chronic cutaneous inflammation, the mRNA expression of both IL-1 ligands as well as IL-1Rrp2 are increased relative to normal healthy skin.

Impairment of this linkage is instrumental in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies. In brain, dystroglycan and dystrophin are expressed on neurons and astrocytes, and some muscular dystrophies cause cognitive dysfunction; however, no extracellular binding partner for neuronal dystroglycan is known. Regular components of the extracellular matrix, such as laminin, agrin, and perlecan, are not abundant in brain except in the perivascular space that is contacted by astrocytes but not by neurons, suggesting that other ligands for neuronal dystroglycan must exist. We have now identified alpha- and beta-neurexins, polymorphic neuron-specific cell surface proteins, as neuronal dystroglycan receptors. The extracellular sequences of alpha- and beta-neurexins are largely composed of laminin-neurexin-sex hormone-binding globulin (LNS)/laminin G domains, which are also found in laminin, agrin, and perlecan, that are dystroglycan ligands. Dystroglycan binds specifically to a subset of the LNS domains of neurexins in a tight interaction that requires glycosylation of dystroglycan and is regulated by alternative splicing of neurexins. Neurexins are receptors for the excitatory neurotoxin alpha-latrotoxin; this toxin competes with dystroglycan for binding, suggesting overlapping binding sites on neurexins for dystroglycan and alpha-latrotoxin. Our data indicate that dystroglycan is a physiological ligand for neurexins and that neurexins' tightly regulated interaction could mediate cell adhesion between brain cells.\",\n",
       " '11470831': \"The epithelial-mesenchymal interactions required for kidney organogenesis are disrupted in mice lacking the integrin alpha8beta1. None of this integrin's known ligands, however, appears to account for this phenotype. To identify a more relevant ligand, a soluble integrin alpha8beta1 heterodimer fused to alkaline phosphatase (AP) has been used to probe blots and cDNA libraries. In newborn mouse kidney extracts, alpha8beta1-AP detects a novel ligand of 70-90 kD. This protein, named nephronectin, is an extracellular matrix protein with five EGF-like repeats, a mucin region containing a RGD sequence, and a COOH-terminal MAM domain. Integrin alpha8beta1 and several additional RGD-binding integrins bind nephronectin. Nephronectin mRNA is expressed in the ureteric bud epithelium, whereas alpha8beta1 is expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme. Nephronectin is localized in the extracellular matrix in the same distribution as the ligand detected by alpha8beta1-AP and forms a complex with alpha8beta1 in vivo. Thus, these results strongly suggest that nephronectin is a relevant ligand mediating alpha8beta1 function in the kidney. Nephronectin is expressed at numerous sites outside the kidney, so it may also have wider roles in development. The approaches used here should be generally useful for characterizing the interactions of novel extracellular matrix proteins identified through genomic sequencing projects.\",\n",

A critical question has been how the activation of these receptors is regulated. Most, if not all, of the known ligands for these receptors are soluble factors. However, as matrix components are highly tissue-specific and change during development and pathology, it has been suggested that select growth factor receptors might be stimulated by binding to matrix components. Herein, we describe a new class of ligand for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) found within the EGF-like repeats of tenascin-C, an antiadhesive matrix component present during organogenesis, development, and wound repair. Select EGF-like repeats of tenascin-C elicited mitogenesis and EGFR autophosphorylation in an EGFR-dependent manner. Micromolar concentrations of EGF-like repeats induced EGFR autophosphorylation and activated extracellular signal-regulated, mitogen-activated protein kinase to levels comparable to those induced by subsaturating levels of known EGFR ligands. EGFR-dependent adhesion was noted when the ligands were tethered to inert beads, simulating the physiologically relevant presentation of tenascin-C as hexabrachion, and suggesting an increase in avidity similar to that seen for integrin ligands upon surface binding. Specific binding to EGFR was further established by immunofluorescence detection of EGF-like repeats bound to cells and cross-linking of EGFR with the repeats. Both of these interactions were abolished upon competition by EGF and enhanced by dimerization of the EGF-like repeat. Such low affinity behavior would be expected for a matrix-\"tethered\" ligand; i.e., a ligand which acts from the matrix, presented continuously to cell surface EGF receptors, because it can neither diffuse away nor be internalized and degraded. These data identify a new class of \"insoluble\" growth factor ligands and a novel mode of activation for growth factor receptors.',\n",

NPVF mRNA was detected specifically in a region between the dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei. NPVF-derived peptides displayed higher affinity for FF1 than NPFF-derived peptides, but showed poor agonist activity for FF2. Following intracerebral ventricular administration, a NPVF-derived peptide blocked morphine-induced analgesia more potently than NPFF in both acute and inflammatory models of pain. In situ hybridization analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of FF1 and FF2 in the rat central nervous system. FF1 was broadly distributed, with the highest levels found in specific regions of the limbic system and the brainstem where NPVF-producing neurons were shown to project. FF2, in contrast, was mostly expressed in the spinal cord and some regions of the thalamus. These results indicate that the endogenous ligands for FF1 and FF2 are NPVF- and NPFF-derived peptides, respectively, and suggest that the NPVF/FF1 system may be an important part of endogenous anti-opioid mechanism.',\n",

Several galanin receptor subtypes are present in dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord with a differential distribution. Here, we describe a generation of a specific galanin R2 (GalR2) agonist, AR-M1896, and its application in studies of a rat neuropathic pain model (Bennett). The results show that in normal rats mechanical and cold allodynia of the hindpaw are induced after intrathecal infusion of low-dose galanin (25 ng per 0.5 microl/h). The same effect is seen with equimolar doses of AR-M1896 or AR-M961, an agonist both at GalR1 and GalR2 receptors. In allodynic Bennett model rats, the mechanical threshold increased dose-dependently after intrathecal injection of a high dose of AR-M961, whereas no effect was observed in the control or AR-M1896 group. No effect of either of the two compounds was observed in nonallodynic Bennett model rats. These data indicate that a low dose of galanin has a nociceptive role at the spinal cord level mediated by GalR2 receptors, whereas the antiallodynic effect of high-dose galanin on neuropathic pain is mediated by the GalR1 receptors. Thus, a selective GalR1 agonist may be used to treat neuropathic pain.',\n",

       " '11485994': 'Nodal proteins have crucial roles in mesendoderm formation and left-right patterning during vertebrate development. The molecular mechanisms of signal transduction by Nodal and related ligands, however, are not fully understood. In this paper, we present biochemical and functional evidence that the orphan type I serine/threonine kinase receptor ALK7 acts as a receptor for mouse Nodal and Xenopus Nodal-related 1 (Xnr1). Receptor reconstitution experiments indicate that ALK7 collaborates with ActRIIB to confer responsiveness to Xnr1 and Nodal. Both receptors can independently bind Xnr1. In addition, Cripto, an extracellular protein genetically implicated in Nodal signaling, can independently interact with both Xnr1 and ALK7, and its expression greatly enhances the ability of ALK7 and ActRIIB to respond to Nodal ligands. The Activin receptor ALK4 is also able to mediate Nodal signaling but only in the presence of Cripto, with which it can also interact directly. A constitutively activated form of ALK7 mimics the mesendoderm-inducing activity of Xnr1 in Xenopus embryos, whereas a dominant-negative ALK7 specifically blocks the activities of Nodal and Xnr1 but has little effect on other related ligands. In contrast, a dominant-negative ALK4 blocks all mesoderm-inducing ligands tested, including Nodal, Xnr1, Xnr2, Xnr4, and Activin. In agreement with a role in Nodal signaling, ALK7 mRNA is localized to the ectodermal and organizer regions of Xenopus gastrula embryos and is expressed during early stages of mouse embryonic development. Therefore, our results indicate that both ALK4 and ALK7 can mediate signal transduction by Nodal proteins, although ALK7 appears to be a receptor more specifically dedicated to Nodal signaling.',\n",

FGFR binding specificity is an essential mechanism in the regulation of FGF signaling and is achieved through primary sequence differences among FGFs and FGFRs and through usage of two alternative exons, IIIc and IIIb, for the second half of immunoglobulin-like domain 3 (D3) in FGFRs. While FGF4 binds and activates the IIIc splice forms of FGFR1 to -3 at comparable levels, it shows little activity towards the IIIb splice forms of FGFR1 to -3 as well as towards FGFR4. To begin to explore the structural determinants for this differential affinity, we determined the crystal structure of FGF4 at a 1.8-A resolution. FGF4 adopts a beta-trefoil fold similar to other FGFs. To identify potential receptor and heparin binding sites in FGF4, a ternary FGF4-FGFR1-heparin model was constructed by superimposing the FGF4 structure onto FGF2 in the FGF2-FGFR1-heparin structure. Mutation of several key residues in FGF4, observed to interact with FGFR1 or with heparin in the model, produced ligands with reduced receptor binding and concomitant low mitogenic potential. Based on the modeling and mutational data, we propose that FGF4, like FGF2, but unlike FGF1, engages the betaC'-betaE loop in D3 and thus can differentiate between the IIIc and IIIb splice isoforms of FGFRs for binding. Moreover, we show that FGF4 needs to interact with both the 2-O- and 6-O-sulfates in heparin to exert its optimal biological activity.\",\n",

Nevertheless, recent findings have indicated that our understanding of the structure and function of alphaIIbbeta3 remains inadequate. This article addresses two aspects of still evolving alphaIIbbeta3 function: 1) the interface between alphaIIbbeta3 and the blood coagulation system, resulting from interaction of prothrombin with the receptor; and 2) the molecular basis for recognition of the RGD and the fibrinogen gamma-chain peptide ligands by alphaIIbbeta3. As illustrated by these two examples, there is still much to be learned about alphaIIbbeta3 if we are to fully appreciate its functions and its potential as a therapeutic target.',\n",

Whereas a hypothalamic form of GnRH of variable structure (designated type I) had been shown to regulate reproduction through a cognate type I receptor, it has recently become evident that most vertebrates have one or two other forms of GnRH. One of these, designated type II GnRH (GnRH II: pGlu-His-Ser-His-Gly-Trp-Tyr-Pro-Gly-NH2), is conserved from fish to man and is widely distributed in the brain, suggesting important neuromodulatory functions such as regulating K+ channels and stimulating sexual arousal. We now report the cloning of a type II GnRH receptor from marmoset cDNA. The receptor has only 41% identity with the type I receptor and, unlike the type I receptor, has a carboxyl-terminal tail. The receptor is highly selective for GnRH II. As with the type I receptor, it couples to G(alpha)q/11 and also activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) but differs in activating p38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase. The type II receptor is more widely distributed than the type I receptor and is expressed throughout the brain, including areas associated with sexual arousal, and in diverse non-neural and reproductive tissues, suggesting a variety of functions. Surprisingly, the type II receptor is expressed in the majority of gonadotropes. The presence of two GnRH receptors in gonadotropes, together with the differences in their signaling, suggests different roles in gonadotrope functioning.',\n",

Arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART1) is expressed on the surface of a number of cell types, and catalyses the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD(+) to target proteins. We investigated whether extracellular proteins such as growth factors may serve as substrates for this enzyme, with subsequent alteration in their biological activity. Experiments were performed with rat skeletal muscle membranes and V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts with doxycycline-inducible expression of human ART. 2. From a panel of growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) was found to be the best substrate for ART1, whereas the structural homologue PDGF-AA was not a substrate. Under conditions of maximum labelling 5 mol ADP-ribose was incorporated per mol of PDGF-BB. 3. Purified (ADP-ribosyl)-PDGF-BB did not stimulate a mitogenic or chemotactic response in human pulmonary smooth muscle cells, and showed a reduced capacity to bind to PDGF receptors in competition binding experiments, when compared to unmodified PDGF-BB. 4. PDGF-dependent [(3)H-methyl]-thymidine incorporation was measured in the ART1-transfected fibroblast cell line at physiological concentrations of PDGF-BB, and without addition of extracellular NAD(+). Fibroblasts expressing human ART1 at the cell surface showed reduced mitogenic responses to PDGF-BB, but not to PDGF-AA. This loss of mitogenic response in cells expressing ART1 activity was reversed by the addition of agmatine (an ART1 substrate). 5. In conclusion, we propose that PDGF-BB-dependent signalling may be regulated by post-translational modification of the growth factor by ART1 at the cell surface. This has been demonstrated in membranes of rat skeletal muscle, and the reaction confirmed in ART1-transfected fibroblasts.',\n",

Sequence analysis of cDNA fragments encoding uPA-binding peptides indicated the existence of a composite uPA-binding structure including all three uPAR domains. This finding was confirmed by experiments using an overlapping 15-mer peptide array covering the entire uPAR molecule. Four regions within the uPAR sequence were found to directly bind to uPA: two distinct regions containing amino acids 13--20 and amino acids 74--84 of the uPAR domain I, and regions in the putative loop 3 of the domains II and III. All the uPA-binding fragments from the three domains were shown to have an agonistic effect on uPA binding to immobilized uPAR. Furthermore, uPAR-(154--176) increased uPAR-transfected BAF3-cell adhesion on vitronectin in the presence of uPA, whereas uPAR-(247--276) stimulated the cell adhesion both in the absence or presence of uPA. The latter fragment was also able to augment the binding of vitronectin to uPAR in a purified system, thereby mimicking the effect of uPA on this interaction.

Furthermore, transfected NICD molecules showed a significantly greater specific activity of phosphorylation, or hyperphosphorylation, compared to TMIC molecules. Hyperphosphorylation of NICD was also observed when NICD was generated by an endogenous intramembraneous cleavage of TMIC. However, TMIC molecules bearing a mutation that reduces intramembraneous cleavage (V1744K) did not show an enhanced incorporation of phosphate, suggesting that cleavage is required for hyperphosphorylation. Using deletion constructs to map the sites of phosphorylation, we observed that a domain of 93 amino acids downstream of the ankyrin repeats incorporated the majority of (32)P in vivo. This sequence was also required for activation of the HES-1 promoter. In addition, we observed that hyperphosphorylated forms of the intracellular domain were more likely to interact with the transcriptional coactivator RBP. However, dephosphorylation experiments showed that the interaction between RBP and the intracellular domain of Notch was not dependent upon Notch1IC phosphorylation.

In the absence of hrg, HER3-ECD(I-IV) is cleaved after position Tyr(50), near the beginning of domain I. Binding of hrg to HER3-ECD(I-IV) fully protects position Tyr(50) from proteolysis. To confirm that domain I contains a hrg binding site, we expressed domains I and II (HER3-ECD(I-II)) and find that it binds hrg with 68 nm affinity. These data suggest that domains I and II of HER3-ECD(I-IV) act as a functional unit in folding and binding of hrg. Thus, our biochemical findings reinforce the structural hypothesis of others that HER3-ECD(I-IV) is similar to the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), as follows: 1) The protected cleavage site in HER3-ECD(I-IV) corresponds to a binding footprint in domain I of IGF-1R; 2) HER3-ECD(I-II) binds hrg with a 68 nm dissociation constant, supporting the hypothesis that domain I is involved in ligand binding; and 3) the large accessible surface area (1749 A) of domain L1 of IGF-1R that is buried by domain S1, as well as the presence of conserved contacts in this interface of type 1 RTKs, suggests that domains L1 and S1 of IGF-1R function as a unit as observed for HER3-ECD(I-II). Our results are consistent with the proposal that HER3 has a structure similar to IGF-1R and binds ligand at a site in corresponding domains.',\n",
       " '11557679': 'Since the molecular identification of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), an ever increasing number of related proteins have been discovered. These receptors belonging to the LDLR family are thought to play key roles in lipoprotein metabolism in a variety of tissues, including the arterial wall. We have discovered that the expression of a 250-kDa mosaic LDLR-related protein, which we termed LR11 for the presence of 11 LDLR ligand-binding repeats, is markedly induced in smooth muscle cells in the hyperplastic intima of animal models used for the study of atherosclerosis. Here, we demonstrate that the human LR11, when overexpressed in hamster cells, binds and internalizes 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), an in vitro ligand for all receptors belonging to the LDLR family. Furthermore, LR11 binds the apolipoprotein E (apoE)-rich lipoproteins, beta-very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs), with a high affinity similar to that of other members, such as the LDLR and VLDL receptor. RAP and beta-VLDL compete with each other; however, other serum lipoproteins are not able to inhibit their binding. LR11 shows specific binding of apoE-enriched HDL prepared from human cerebrospinal fluid as well as of beta-VLDL, suggesting that the apoE content of lipoproteins is most likely important for mediating the high-affinity binding to the receptor. LR11-overexpressing cells are able to internalize and degrade the bound beta-VLDL; these cells also show increased accumulation of cholesteryl esters when incubated with beta-VLDL. Incubation for 48 hours with beta-VLDL of LR11-overexpressing cells, but not of control cells, promotes the appearance of numerous intracellular lipid droplets. Taken together, LR11, a mosaic LDLR family member whose expression in smooth muscle cells is markedly induced in atheroma, has all the properties of a receptor for the endocytosis of lipoproteins, particularly for the incorporation of apoE-rich lipoproteins.',\n",

Immunoanalysis of membranes prepared from cells expressing a c-myc-tagged version of hNT1-R revealed multiple c-myc cross-reacting polypeptides of high molecular mass, suggesting that hNT1-R was glycosylated in yeast. High-affinity binding sites for 125I-labeled-[monoiodo-Tyr3]neurotensin ([125I-Tyr3]NT) were detected on hNT1-R-expressing cells with Kd and Bmax values of 3.2 nM and of 500 receptors per cell, respectively. Competition binding studies of neurotensin with SR142948 and SR48692, two nonpeptidic antagonists of hNT1-R, indicated that the yeast-produced recombinant receptor displayed the same pharmacological properties as hNT1-R expressed in mammalian cells. Interestingly, neurotensin activated the pheromone pathway in hNT1-R-expressing cells in a dose-dependent fashion, as revealed by a beta-galactosidase activity assay with a pheromone-responsive Fus1:lacZ construct. Mutational inactivation of the SST2 and STE2 genes increased the level of beta-galactosidase activity in response to neurotensin by twofold. Recombinant hNT1-R-producing cells, which lacked the endogenous G-protein-coupled receptor for the alpha pheromone, mated with wild-type MATalpha haploid cells in response to neurotensin, leading to bona fide diploid zygote formation. This is the first report of a mammalian receptor that can replace the endogenous pheromone receptor when produced in yeast, by signaling a fully effective, agonist-induced, mating process.',\n",

The mechanisms of this removal involve recognition of the apoptotic cell surface and initiation of phagocytic uptake into a variety of cell types. Here we provide evidence that C1q and mannose binding lectin (MBL), a member of the collectin family of proteins, bind to apoptotic cells and stimulate ingestion of these by ligation on the phagocyte surface of the multifunctional protein, calreticulin (also known as the cC1qR), which in turn is bound to the endocytic receptor protein CD91, also known as the alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor. Use of these proteins provides another example of apoptotic cell clearance mediated by pattern recognition molecules of the innate immune system. Ingestion of the apoptotic cells through calreticulin/CD91 stimulation is further shown to involve the process of macropinocytosis, implicated as a primitive and relatively nonselective uptake mechanism for C1q- and MBL-enhanced engulfment of whole, intact apoptotic cells, as well as cell debris and foreign organisms to which these molecules may bind.',\n",

The family of HH proteins consists of at least three different members, i.e., sonic HH (SHH), Indian HH (IHH), and desert HH (DHH). SHH is the most broadly expressed member of this family and is probably responsible for the major effects of this signaling pathway. The HH signal is received and transduced via a specific receptor complex composed of patched (PTCH) and smoothened (SMOH) transmembrane proteins. Abnormalities in this signaling cascade have been found in various developmental pathologies and neoplasms such as basal cell carcinoma. The abnormalities are associated with congenital or sporadic genetic alteration affecting function of different components of the HH signaling pathway, including SHH, PTCH, SMOH and GLI proteins.',\n",

In addition, mda-7 and IL-20, but not IL-19, bind to another receptor complex, composed by IL-22R and DIRS1/IL20Rbeta (type II IL-20R). In both cases, binding of the ligands results in STAT3 phosphorylation and activation of a minimal promoter including STAT-binding sites. Taken together, these results demonstrate that: 1) IL-20 induces STAT activation through IL-20R complexes of two types; 2) mda-7 and IL-20 redundantly signal through both complexes; and 3) IL-19 signals only through the type I IL-20R complex.',\n",

Its cytoplasmic tail binds to Src homology 2 domain-containing protein 1A (signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-associated protein), a protein encoded by the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease gene. It is preferentially expressed on B lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets. We show that it is also expressed on thymocytes and T cells. CD84 was positive on CD4-CD8- thymocytes, and its expression decreased with cell maturation. It is expressed on mature T cells preferentially on CD45RO+. To identify the CD84 ligand, we generated a soluble Ig fusion protein containing the human CD84 extracellular domains (CD84-Ig). Because receptor-ligand interactions occur between several members of this subfamily, we assayed CD84-Ig binding with all members of the CD2 family. CD84-Ig bound to CD84-transfected cells, whereas no binding was detected with cells expressing other CD2 subfamily receptors, showing that CD84 binds to itself. Anti-CD84 mAbs recognizing epitopes wholly within domain 1 of CD84 blocked the binding of the CD84-Ig fusion protein to CD84-transfected cells and platelets. Data from CD84 domain human/mouse chimeras further revealed that only the first extracellular domain of the molecule is involved in the ligand receptor recognition. The CD84-CD84 interaction was independent of its cytoplasmic tail. Finally, concurrent ligation of human CD84 with mAbs or CD84-Ig and CD3 enhanced IFN-gamma secretion in human lymphocytes. Thus, CD84 is its own ligand and acts as a costimulatory molecule.',\n",

Their high-affinity interaction, which is likely to contribute to BM assembly and function, is mediated by the central G2 domain in nidogen and the third immunoglobulin (IG)-like domain in perlecan, IG3. We have solved the crystal structure at 2.0 A resolution of the mouse nidogen-1 G2-perlecan IG3 complex. Perlecan IG3 belongs to the I-set of the IG superfamily and binds to the wall of the nidogen-1 G2 beta-barrel using beta-strands C, D and F. Nidogen-1 residues participating in the extensive interface are highly conserved, whereas the corresponding binding site on perlecan is more variable.

While TNF family cytokines share a common structural scaffold, individual receptor-ligand pairs associate with high specificity. Given the low level of amino acid conservation among members of the TNF superfamily, the means by which these molecules achieve specificity cannot be completely understood without knowledge of their three-dimensional structures. To determine the elements of RANKL that mediate RANK activation, we have crystallized the ectodomain of murine RANKL and solved its structure to a resolution of 2.6 A. RANKL self-associates as a homotrimer with four unique surface loops that distinguish it from other TNF family cytokines. Mutagenesis of selected residues in these loops significantly modulates RANK activation, as evidenced by in vitro osteoclastogenesis, thereby establishing their necessity in mediating the biological activities of RANKL. Such structural determinants of RANKL-RANK specificity may be of relevance in the pharmacologic design of compounds to ameliorate osteopenic disorders of bone.',\n",

We investigated the response of primary and immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells to IL-9 stimulation with respect to the release of T-cell chemoattractant factors. In response to IL-9, the HBE4-E6/E7 cell line, but not BEAS-2B cells, released the T-cell chemoattractants IL-16 and regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) in a dose-dependent fashion. We found a similar dose response to IL-9 in primary cells from bronchial brushings of healthy subjects and that nearly all of the T-cell chemoattraction was attributable to IL-16 and RANTES. Reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction of BEAS-2B, HBE4-E6/E7, and primary cells from two subjects revealed messenger RNA for IL-9 receptor (IL-9R) alpha but not in BEAS-2B cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of HBE4-E6/E7 and primary cells confirmed surface expression of the IL-9 receptor. Costimulation of both cell types with IL-9 and antibody to either gamma-common chain or IL-9Ralpha completely blocked the release of T-cell chemoattractant activity, confirming the primary role of a functioning IL-9 receptor for IL-9 signaling in HBE4-E6/E7 and primary bronchial epithelial cells. We conclude that IL-9 is a stimulus for airway epithelial cell release of T-cell chemoattractant factors, which in turn may modulate the immune response in allergic airway inflammation.',\n",

At the cellular level we show expression of JAM3 transcript within endothelial cells. Our major finding is that JAM3 and JAM2 are binding partners. Thus, JAM3 ectodomain binds firmly to JAM2-Fc. This heterotypic interaction is maintained when JAM3-Fc is used to capture Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing full-length JAM2. In static adhesion assays we show that JAM3 is unable to bind to leukocyte cell lines. This is consistent with the lack of JAM2 expression. However, using JAM2-Fc pull-down experiments in combination with polyclonal anti-JAM3 serum, we demonstrate that JAM3 is the previously uncharacterized 43-kDa counter-receptor that mediates JAM2 adhesion to T cells. Most significantly we demonstrate up-regulation of JAM3 protein on peripheral blood lymphocytes following activation. Finally we show the utility of JAM3 ectodomain as an inhibitor of JAM2 adhesion.',\n",

Here, we investigated and compared structural requirements for the homophilic adhesion of CEACAM6 and heterophilic adhesion between CEACAM6 and CEACAM8 at the amino acid level by using CHO transfectants expressing their mutant and chimeric proteins. The NH(2)-terminal domain (N-domain) of CEACAM6 expressed on a CHO cell was suggested to bind the N-domain of CEACAM6 or CEACAM8 on the opposing cell.

PTH weakly stimulates cAMP accumulation via the rat receptor, and here we show it did not detectably increase intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and bound with low affinity (450 nM). For the human PTH2 receptor PTH was a full agonist for increasing cAMP, a partial agonist for increasing [Ca2+]i, and bound with high affinity (18 nM). In addition, the antagonists PTH(7-34) and TIP(7-39) bound with 10- to 49-fold lower affinity to the rat receptor. We investigated the molecular basis of differential PTH and antagonist interaction with human and rat PTH2 receptors by using chimeric human/rat PTH2 receptors. PTH cAMP-signaling efficacy (Emax) was determined by extracellular loop (EL) 1 and a region including EL2 and EL3. The N-terminal domain determined PTH binding selectivity at the inactive receptor state. Multiple regions throughout the receptor are required for the PTH-PTH2 receptor complex to adopt a high-affinity active state: inserting the rat receptor's N-terminal domain, EL1 or EL2/3, into the human receptor increased PTH's EC50 and reciprocal exchanges did not reduce EC50. This suggests the global receptor conformation prevents the rat receptor from adopting a high-affinity state when in complex with PTH. N-terminal ligand truncation, producing the antagonists PTH(7-34) and TIP(7-39), altered ligand interaction with the membrane-embedded domain of the receptor, eliminating EL2/3 as a specificity determinant and lowering binding affinity. These insights should contribute to the development of a high-affinity PTH2 receptor antagonist, for investigating the receptor's physiological role.\",\n",

In the presence of high molecular weight kininogen (45 nm), Zn(2+) and Ca(2+) ions, thrombin activated factor XI in the presence of glycocalicin at rates comparable with those seen in the presence of dextran sulfate (1 microg/ml). With higher high molecular weight kininogen concentrations (360 nm), the rate of thrombin-catalyzed factor XI activation in the presence of glycocalicin was comparable with that on activated platelets.

Therefore, we compared the mechanism for engagement by vMIP-II of CCR5 to its interaction with physiologic ligands. RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and vMIP-II bound CCR5 at high affinity, but demonstrated partial cross-competition. Characterization of 15 CCR5 alanine scanning mutants of charged extracellular amino acids revealed that alteration of acidic residues in the distal N-ter abrogated binding of RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and vMIP-II. Whereas mutation of residues in ECL2 of CCR5 dramatically reduced the binding of RANTES and MIP-1 alpha and their ability to induce signaling, interaction with vMIP-II was not altered by any mutation in the exoloops of the receptor. Paradoxically, monoclonal antibodies to N-ter epitopes did not block chemokine binding, but those mapped to ECL2 were effective inhibitors. A CCR5 chimera with the distal N-ter residues of CXCR2 bound MIP-1 alpha and vMIP-II with an affinity similar to that of the wild-type receptor. Engagement of CCR5 by vMIP-II, but not RANTES or MIP-1 alpha blocked the binding of monoclonal antibodies to the receptor, providing additional evidence for a distinct mechanism for viral chemokine binding. Analysis of the coreceptor activity of randomly generated mouse-human CCR5 chimeras implicated residues in ECL2 between H173 and V197 in this function. RANTES, but not vMIP-II blocked CCR5 M-tropic coreceptor activity in the fusion assay. The insensitivity of vMIP-II binding to mutations in ECL2 provides a potential rationale to its inefficiency as an antagonist of CCR5 coreceptor activity. These findings suggest that the molecular anatomy of CCR5 binding plays a critical role in antagonism of coreceptor activity.\",\n",

Both plasma-derived C4BP and recombinant C4BP consisting of only its alpha-chains (rC4BPalpha) bound efficiently to immobilized LRP, as determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Complementary, two distinct fragments of LRP, i.e. clusters II and IV, both associated to immobilized rC4BPalpha, and binding could be inhibited by the LRP antagonist receptor-associated protein. Further analysis showed that association of rC4BPalpha to LRP was inhibited by heparin or by anti-C4BP antibody RU-3B9, which recognizes the heparin-binding region of the C4BP alpha-chains. In cellular degradation experiments, LRP-expressing fibroblasts effectively degraded (125)I-labeled rC4BPalpha, whereas their LRP-deficient counterparts displayed a 4-fold diminished capacity of degrading (125)I-rC4BPalpha. Finally, initial clearance of C4BP in mice was significantly delayed upon co-injection with receptor-associated protein. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the alpha-chains of C4BP comprise a binding site for LRP.

Individuals with the risk genotype for both genes were at almost five times greater risk for the development of asthma compared to individuals with both non-risk genotypes (P=.0004).

We also demonstrate, for the first time, evidence of cross-talk between Eph receptors. Overexpression of a catalytically active member of the Eph-B subfamily, EphB1, resulted in increased EphB6 phosphorylation. EphB1-induced EphB6 phosphorylation was ligand-dependent and required the functional catalytic activity of EphB1. EphB1 not only transphosphorylated EphB6, but together they also formed a stable hetero-complex. In addition, we identify the proto-oncogene c-Cbl as an EphB6-binding protein. Although EphB6-Cbl association appeared to be constitutive, Cbl required a functional phosphotyrosine binding domain in order to bind the receptor, whereas its RING finger motif ubiquitin-transfer domain was not necessary. Our findings demonstrate that EphB6 is an actively signaling receptor that undergoes transphosphorylation upon ligand binding and that can initiate specific cytoplasmic signaling events.',\n",

Using various chemokines or defensins fused with nonimmunogenic tumor Ags, we studied their capacity to delivery Ags to subsets of immune cells to elicit antitumor immunity.

In contrast to the NTR1, which has been extensively studied, little is known about the pharmacological and biological properties of the NTR2. In the course of characterizing NT analogs that exhibited binding selectivity for the NTR2, we discovered that this receptor constitutively activated inositol phosphate (IP) production. Here, we report on the constitutive activity of the human NTR2 (hNTR2) transfected in COS cells and on compounds that exhibit agonism, inverse agonism, and neutral antagonism at this receptor. IP levels increased linearly with time, whereas they remained constant in mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, IP production was proportional to the amount of hNTR2 present at the cell membrane. SR 48692, a nonpeptide antagonist of the NTR1, stimulated IP production, whereas levocabastine, a nonpeptide histamine H1 antagonist that binds the NTR2 but not the NTR1, behaved as a weak partial inverse agonist. NT analogs modified at position 11 of the NT molecule, in particular by the introduction of bulky aromatic D amino acids, exhibited binding selectivity at the hNTR2 and also behaved as partial inverse agonists, reversing constitutive IP production up to 50%. Finally, NT barely affected constitutive IP production but antagonized the effects of both agonist and inverse agonist compounds, thus behaving as a neutral antagonist. The unique pharmacological profile of the hNTR2 is discussed in the light of its sequence similarity with the NTR1 and the known binding site topology of NT and SR 48692 in the NTR1.',\n",

Peptidoglycan (PGN), a cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, is known to elicit excessive proinflammatory cytokine production from immune cells. In this study we investigated whether SP-A interacts with PGN and alters PGN-elicited cellular responses. Binding studies demonstrate that PGN is not a ligand for SP-A. However, SP-A significantly reduced PGN-elicited tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion by U937 cells and rat alveolar macrophages. The inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha secretion was dependent upon SP-A concentrations in physiological range. Coincubation of SP-A and PGN with human embryonic kidney 293 cells that had been transiently transfected with the cDNA of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), a cell signaling receptor for PGN, significantly attenuated PGN-induced nuclear factor-kappaB activity. SP-A directly bound to a soluble form of the recombinant extracellular TLR2 domain (sTLR2). Coincubation of sTLR2 with SP-A significantly reduced the binding of sTLR2 to PGN. These results indicate that the direct interaction of SP-A with TLR2 alters PGN-induced cell signaling. We propose that SP-A modulates inflammatory responses against the bacterial components by interactions with pattern-recognition receptors.',\n",

MDC-L (ADAM 28), a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) protein family, is expressed on the surface of human lymphocytes. ADAMs possess a disintegrin-like domain similar in sequence to small non-enzymatic snake venom peptides that act as integrin antagonists. We report here that the disintegrin domain of MDC-L is recognized by the leukocyte integrin alpha(4)beta(1). Recombinant Fc fusion proteins possessing the disintegrin domain of MDC-L supported adhesion of the T-lymphoma cell line, Jurkat, in a concentration- and divalent cation-dependent manner. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the disintegrin domain of MDC-L was inhibited by an anti-MDC-L monoclonal antibody (mAb), Dis1-1. The epitope for mAb Dis1-1 was localized within 59 residues of the disintegrin domain. Recombinant expression of this 59-residue fragment of the disintegrin domain also supported cell adhesion. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the MDC-L disintegrin domain was specifically inhibited by anti-alpha(4) and anti-beta(1) function-blocking mAbs. Furthermore, adhesion of various cell lines to MDC-L correlated with expression of the integrin alpha(4)-subunit. Transfected K562 cells expressing alpha(4)beta(1) adhered to the disintegrin domain in contrast to non-transfected K562 cells. We further investigated the binding of recombinant MDC-L disintegrin domain (rDis-Fc) in solution. The rDis-Fc was found to bind to Jurkat cells in solution in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner. Both adhesion and solution binding of rDis-Fc was inhibited by the alpha(4)beta(1) ligand mimetic CS-1 peptide. Additionally, recognition of the MDC-L disintegrin domain required \"activation\" of lymphocyte beta(1) integrins. The interaction of MDC-L with alpha(4)beta(1) may potentially regulate metalloprotease function by targeting or sequestering the active protease on the cell surface. These results suggest a potential role for the lymphocyte ADAM, MDC-L, in the interaction of lymphocytes with alpha(4)beta(1)-expressing leukocytes.',\n",

To understand how structural variations of the antagonistic peptide effect pharmacodynamic properties, binding affinities and antagonistic potencies toward the human and rat GnRH receptor were determined. Whereas large substituents in position 6 of linear peptides are compatible with high binding affinity (K(D) < 0.5 nM), all cyclized peptides except the cyclo[3-10] analog D-52391 depicted low binding affinity (K(D) > 10 nM). Binding affinity and antagonistic potency in vitro correlated for all peptides and surprisingly no discrimination between human and rat receptor proteins was observed. Since receptor residues W(101) and N(102) are involved in agonist and antagonist binding, equally potent but structurally different antagonists were tested for binding to the respective W(101)A and N(102)A mutants. In contrast to linear decapeptides, residues N(102) and W(101) are not involved in binding of D-23938 and W(101) is the critical residue for D-52391 binding. We conclude that although equally potent, peptidic GnRH receptor antagonists do have distinct interactions within the ligand binding pocket. Finally, selected antagonists were tested for testosterone suppression in male rats. The duration of testosterone suppression below castration levels differed largely from 1 day for Ganirelix to 27 days for D-23487.

The molecular mechanisms that direct their localization to the node are not well understood but are believed to involve contact-dependent signals from myelinating Schwann cells and interactions of Na(+) channels with the cytoskeletal protein, ankyrin G. Two cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) expressed at the axon surface, Nr-CAM and neurofascin, are also linked to ankyrin G and accumulate at early stages of node formation, suggesting that they mediate contact-dependent Schwann cell signals to initiate node development. To examine the potential role of Nr-CAM in this process, we treated myelinating cocultures of DRG (dorsal root ganglion) neurons and Schwann cells with an Nr-CAM-Fc (Nr-Fc) fusion protein. Nr-Fc had no effect on initial axon-Schwann cell interactions, including Schwann cell proliferation, or on the extent of myelination, but it strikingly and specifically inhibited Na(+) channel and ankyrin G accumulation at the node. Nr-Fc bound directly to neurons and clustered and coprecipitated neurofascin expressed on axons. These results provide the first evidence that neurofascin plays a major role in the formation of nodes, possibly via interactions with Nr-CAM.',\n",

Using site-directed mutants of recombinant RP S19 and synthetic peptides mimicking RP S19 molecular regions, we currently identified the binding sites of the RP S19 dimer to the C5a receptor. The RP S19 dimer activated the receptor by a two-step binding mechanism as in the case of C5a. The first binding site was a basic cluster region containing a -Lys41-His42-Lys43- sequence. The second one was the -Leu131-Asp132-Arg133- moiety, localized 12 residues upstream from the COOH-terminal. The second binding triggered the chemotactic response. The first binding would have a role in achieving a high-binding affinity between the ligand and receptor.

There was no significant difference in eliciting Ca(2+) flux and chemotaxis among the variants with the exception of LD78beta(T9A) showing a substantially reduced activity. The comparative order for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication inhibition was: LD78beta(P8A) > LD78beta(D6A) > LD78beta(WT), LD78beta(L3A) > LD78beta(T7A), LD78beta(P2A) > LD78beta(T9A). In binding inhibition assays of LD78beta variants using 2D7 monoclonal antibody and (125)I-labeled macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, the comparative order was: LD78beta(P8A), LD78beta(D6A) > LD78beta(WT) > LD78beta(L3A) > LD78beta(T7A) > LD78beta(T9A), LD78betaP2A). The order for CCR5 down-regulation induction was comparable to that for binding inhibition. The present data suggest that Pro-2, Asp-6, Pro-8, and Thr-9 are critical for LD78beta binding to CCR5 and HIV-1 replication inhibition, and that LD78beta binding to CCR5, regardless of affinity, is sufficient for the initial signal transduction of LD78beta, whereas the greater anti-HIV-1 activity requires the greater magnitude of binding. The data also suggest that LD78beta variants with appropriate amino acid substitution(s) such as LD78beta(D6A) and LD78beta(P8A) may represent effective chemokine-based anti-HIV-1 therapeutics while preserving LD78beta-CCR5 interactions.',\n",

Transfection of chimeric constructs comprising monkey and mouse CD9s showed that the human sequence between Ala156 and Asp183 is essential for the upregulation activity. Studies of mutants, replacing a single amino acid within the region between Ala156 and Asp183 of monkey CD9 with the corresponding amino acid residue in mouse CD9, revealed that substitution of Gly158 is critical for the reduction of the upregulation activity and secondly for the substitution of Val159 and Thr175. These three amino acid residues were deduced to be located on the head domain of the second extracellular loop, suggesting that interactions of CD9 with DTR or DT at the domain containing these three amino acids were important for the upregulation of DT binding.',\n",

Functional (cAMP) and binding in vitro studies were carried out in cells expressing the transfected human GLP-2 receptor. Furthermore, a biologic response of GLP-2 (3-33) was tested in vivo. Mice were allocated to groups treated for 10 days (twice daily) with: (1) 5 microg GLP-2 (1-33), (2) 25 microg GLP-2 (3-33), (3) 5 microg GLP-2 (1-33)+100 microg GLP-2 (3-33), or (4) 5 microg GLP-2 (1-33)+500 microg GLP-2 (3-33).

Increasing doses of GLP-2 (3-33) (10(-7)-10(-5) M) caused a shift to the right in the dose-response curve of GLP-2 (1-33). Treatment of mice with either GLP-2 (1-33) or (3-33) induced significant growth responses in both the small and large intestines, but the response induced by GLP-2 (3-33) was much smaller.

BM, spleen, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood of Dll4-overexpressing mice contained predominantly CD4(+)CD8(+) T cells and virtually lacked B cells. The Dll4-overexpressing mice eventually developed a lethal phenotype that was characterized by the progression of a T-cell lymphoproliferative disease (restricted to BM and lymphoid tissues) to transplantable monoclonal T-cell leukemia/lymphoma scattered to multiple organs.

To further characterize the interactions between Dkk and LRP proteins, conditioned media containing individually conserved cysteine-rich domains of Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 were prepared. Although full-length Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 and the second cysteine-rich domains of both Dkk molecules inhibited Wnt-3a-induced activation of lymphoid enhancing factor (LEF)-1, a downstream target of the canonical pathway, we found that the second cysteine-rich domain of Dkk-2 (Dkk-2C2) was able to stimulate the canonical pathway when LRP-6 was ectopically expressed in NIH3T3 cells. This effect of Dkk-2C2 could be blocked by a monoclonal antibody specific to the second YWTD repeat domain of LRP-5/6, suggesting that Dkk-2C2 acts via LRP-6. We also showed that while both Axin and the DIX domain of Dishevelled (Dvl) could inhibit Dkk-2C2-induced activation of LEF-1, the DEP domain of Dvl, which inhibited Wnt-induced activation of LEF-1, failed to inhibit the activation of LEF-1 by Dkk-2C2 or by an activated form of LRP-5, LRPC2. In addition, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, a potent inhibitor for both Dvl and Wnt, also failed to inhibit LRPC2 or Dkk-2C2. Furthermore, knocking-down the expression of Dvl molecules by short interfering RNAs specific to Dvl inhibited Wnt-induced, but not LRPC2-induced, activation of LEF-1. All the evidence indicates that Dkk-2C2 signals through LRP proteins, which does not require Dvl, while Wnt protein may employ both Dvl, presumably through Fz, and LRP to achieve more efficient signal transduction.',\n",

LC/MS/MS analysis identified three murine splice-variants of the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) in the complexes, which isolate with caveolae-like domains (CLDs). Enzymatic removal of N-linked sugar moieties did not disrupt the complexes, arguing that the interaction of PrP with N-CAM occurs through amino acid side-chains. Additionally, similar levels of PrP/N-CAM complexes were found in N2a and prion-infected N2a (ScN2a) cells. With the use of an N-CAM-specific peptide library, the PrP-binding site was determined to comprise beta-strands C and C' within the two consecutive fibronectin type III (FNIII) modules found in proximity of the membrane-attachment site of N-CAM. As revealed by in situ crosslinking of PrP deletion mutants, the PrP face of the binding site is formed by the N terminus, helix A (residues 144-154) and the adjacent loop region of PrP. N-CAM-deficient (N-CAM(-/-)) mice that were intracerebrally challenged with scrapie prions succumbed to disease with a mean incubation period of 122 (+/-4.1, SEM) days, arguing that N-CAM is not involved in PrP(Sc) replication.

The three-dimensional structure of this domain has been determined by 1H NMR at 800 MHz. The first 34 residues of AGRP(87-132) are well-ordered and contain a three-stranded antiparallel beta sheet, where the last two strands form a beta hairpin. The relative spatial positioning of the disulfide cross-links demonstrates that the ordered region of AGRP(87-132) adopts the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) fold previously identified for numerous invertebrate toxins. Interestingly, this may be the first example of a mammalian protein assigned to the ICK superfamily. The hairpin's turn region presents a triplet of residues (Arg-Phe-Phe) known to be essential for melanocortin receptor binding. The structure also suggests that AGRP possesses an additional melanocortin-receptor contact region within a loop formed by the first 16 residues of its C-terminal domain. This specific region shows little sequence homology to the corresponding region of the agouti protein, which is an MC1R antagonist involved in pigmentation. Consideration of these sequence differences, along with recent experiments on mutant and chimeric melanocortin receptors, allows us to postulate that this loop in the first 16 residues of its C-terminal domain confers AGRP's distinct selectivity for MC3R and MC4R.\",\n",

The receptors for these three cytokines consist of a cytokine-specific alpha (Ralpha) chain and a shared common beta (betac) chain.

Proteasomal degradation of the betac cytoplasmic domain was also a prerequisite for endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the ligated receptor subunits. Moreover, proteasome-dependent termination of signaling induced by one betac-engaging cytokine resulted in cellular desensitization to signal transduction by subsequent stimulation with another betac-engaging cytokine. These data provide the first evidence for ligand-dependent proteasomal degradation of the betac cytoplasmic domain, and they establish a novel mechanism for heterotypic desensitization of shared cytokine receptor signaling.',\n",

To better understand how various inhibitors might block the interaction of VCAM and fibronectin with alpha 4 beta 1, we began constructing a structure model for the integrin alpha 4 beta 1 complex.

Analysis of Schwann cell adhesion and spreading on dishes coated with various type V collagen domains revealed that Schwann cells adhered effectively only to the non-collagenous N-terminal domain (NTD) of the alpha4(V) collagen chain. Schwann cell adhesion to alpha4(V)-NTD induced actin cytoskeleton assembly, tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of the Erk1/Erk2 protein kinases. Adhesion to alpha4(V)-NTD is cell type-specific because rat fibroblasts failed to adhere to dishes coated with this polypeptide. Schwann cell adhesion and spreading on alpha4(V)-NTD was strongly inhibited by soluble heparin (IC(50) approximately 30 ng/ml) but not by chondroitin sulfate. Analysis of the heparin binding activities of a series of recombinant alpha4(V)-NTD fragments and deletion mutants identified a highly basic region (not present in other type V collagen NTD) as the site responsible for high affinity heparin binding. Schwann cells adhered poorly to dishes coated with alpha4(V)-NTD that lacked the heparin binding site and failed to spread or assemble organized actin-cytoskeletal structures. Soluble alpha4(V)-NTD polypeptide that contained the heparin binding site inhibited spreading of Schwann cells on dishes coated with alpha4(V)-NTD. Affinity chromatography of Schwann cell detergent extracts on a column of immobilized alpha4(V)-NTD resulted in the isolation of syndecan-3, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan.

C4a was able to displace C3a, suggesting that C5L2, like the C3a receptor, may have a low binding affinity for this anaphylatoxin. Unlike CD88 and C3a receptor, C5L2 transfected into RBL-2H3 cells does not support degranulation or increases in intracellular [Ca(2+)] and is not rapidly internalized in response to ligand binding. However, ligation of C5L2 by anaphylatoxin did potentiate the degranulation response to cross-linkage of the high affinity IgE receptor by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. These results suggest that C5L2 is an anaphylatoxin-binding protein with unique ligand binding and signaling properties.',\n",

Initially identified as regulators of axon pathfinding and neuronal cell migration, Ephs and ephrins are now known to have roles in many other cell-cell interactions, including those of vascular endothelial cells and specialized epithelia. Here we report the crystal structure of the complex formed between EphB2 and ephrin-B2, determined at 2.7 A resolution. Each Eph receptor binds an ephrin ligand through an expansive dimerization interface dominated by the insertion of an extended ephrin loop into a channel at the surface of the receptor. Two Eph-Ephrin dimers then join to form a tetramer, in which each ligand interacts with two receptors and each receptor interacts with two ligands. The Eph and ephrin molecules are precisely positioned and orientated in these complexes, promoting higher-order clustering and the initiation of bidirectional signalling.',\n",

In the current work, motilin receptor constructs were prepared that included sequential deletions ranging from single residues to twelve amino acid segments throughout this 67 amino acid domain. Each construct was expressed in COS cells and characterized for motilin radioligand binding and motilin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses. The only segments that had negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity included deletion constructs DeltaCys(235), Delta179-182, and Delta241-246. Cys(235) is likely involved in the highly conserved and functionally important disulfide bond linking the first and second loops of G protein-coupled receptors. Alanine replacements for each of the amino acid residues in the other two segments revealed that the perimembranous residues at both ends of this loop, Val(179) and Leu(245) and Arg(246), were responsible for the negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity. Of note, these mutants responded normally to the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin. These data support important functional roles for both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal perimembranous regions of the second loop for responses to the natural agonist peptide, while supporting independent determinants for action of a non-peptidyl agonist ligand.',\n",

In addition, all peptides stimulated a rapid and transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i), and, ACTH1-10 was the most potent. The increases in [Ca(2+)](i) were of intracellular origin, but not associated with inositol phosphate production.

Previous results on the crystal structure of the IL-4/IL4-BP complex and on the functional epitope of IL-4 suggested that this contact comprises a mosaic of two binding clusters. The present mutational analysis of IL4-BP supports this view and demonstrates that the energetically most important group is the receptor carboxylate group of D72 forming an ion pair with IL-4 R88 in cluster II. The second main receptor determinant is the hydroxyl group of Y183 forming a hydrogen bond with IL-4 E9 in cluster I. The latter is engaged in additional hydrogen bonds with Y13 and also in van der Waals contacts with Y127. Receptor residue D72 as well as Y183 are each surrounded by a shell of hydrophobic groups from residues that upon mutation lead to smaller decreases in binding affinity. Analysis of IL4-BP double mutants showed that receptor side-chains within one cluster but not those of different clusters cooperate. Interaction analysis of IL-4 and IL4-BP single mutants also revealed additivity in binding of side-chains between clusters and cooperativity within each cluster I or II.These results show that the high-affinity IL-4/IL4-BP contact is constituted by two independent binding units, each containing a central polar or charged side-chain surrounded by hydrophobic groups (avocado cluster).',\n",

In isolated bioassays HEK-1 was a full agonist at tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptors. In the rat urinary bladder (RUB) HEK-1 was about 3 fold less potent than SP. In the rabbit pulmonary artery (RPA) HEK-1 and in the guinea-pig ileum (GPI), HEK-1 was about 500 fold less potent than NKA and NKB, respectively. 4.

       " '11801679': 'Cooperative action of inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules orchestrates eosinophil recruitment during allergic inflammation in the airways. This study investigated the mechanisms involved in increasing eosinophil adhesion to human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) following priming and activation of eosinophils with TNF-alpha and complement protein C5a, respectively. Under primed conditions, eosinophil adhesion increased 3-fold from basal (16%), and the effect was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the increase following stimulation with C5a alone (2-fold). Eosinophil contact with HBEC was essential for priming. In contrast to C5a, adhesion of eotaxin-stimulated eosinophils to HBEC was not primed with TNF-alpha nor IL-5, a known eosinophil-priming agent. Priming caused activation of alpha(M)beta(2) integrin; mAb against either the common beta(2) integrin subunit or its ICAM-1 ligand reduced the primed component of adhesion. Using mAbs against beta(1) or alpha(5), but not alpha(4) integrin subunit, together with anti-beta(2) integrin mAb, reduced stimulated adhesion to basal levels. Cross-linking alpha(5)beta(1) integrin increased alpha(M)beta(2) integrin-dependent adhesion of eosinophils. There are no known adhesion molecule ligands of alpha(5)beta(1) integrin expressed on HBEC; however, fibronectin, the major matrix protein ligand for alpha(5)beta(1) integrin, was detected in association with HBEC monolayers. A mAb against fibronectin, in combination with anti-beta(2) integrin mAb, reduced adhesion to basal levels. In conclusion, alpha(5)beta(1) integrin may provide a contact-dependent costimulus for eosinophil priming that, together with TNF-alpha, potentiated C5a activation of alpha(M)beta(2) integrin and increased eosinophil adhesion to ICAM-1. Fibronectin, associated with HBEC, may act as a ligand for alpha(5)beta(1) integrin. Dual regulation of eosinophil priming may prevent inappropriate activation of eosinophils in the circulation.',\n",

The purpose of this work was to identify residues in G-protein coupled neurotensin receptors that are directly involved in recycling. Both the high affinity receptor-1 (NTR1) and the levocabastine-sensitive NTR2 are internalized after neurotensin binding. Here, we show that only the mouse NTR2 recycled to the plasma membrane, whereas the rat NTR1 and the human NTR2 did not. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that tyrosine 237 in the third intracellular loop is crucial for recycling of the mouse NTR2. We show that the mouse NTR2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by NT. This phosphorylation is essential for receptor recycling since the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocks this process. The absence of recycling observed with the human NTR2 could be completely explained by the presence of a cysteine instead of a tyrosine in position 237. Indeed, substitution of this cysteine by a tyrosine gave a mutant receptor that has acquired the ability to recycle to the cell surface after neurotensin-induced internalization. This work demonstrates that a single tyrosine residue in the third intracellular loop of a G-protein-coupled receptor is responsible for receptor phosphorylation and represents an essential structural element for receptor recycling.',\n",

This was confirmed by cell-surface binding assays. Binding was calcium- and manganese-dependent. Upon native gel electrophoresis, beta(1)-integrin comigrated with the C-terminal domain of PG-M/versican. The interaction of beta(1)-integrin with the C-terminal domain of PG-M/versican activated focal adhesion kinase, enhanced integrin expression, and promoted cell adhesion. As a result, cells expressing the C-terminal domain of PG-M/versican were resistant to free radical-induced apoptosis. As the PG-M/versican peptide used in this study does not contain the RGD consensus-binding motif for integrins, the mechanism of the observed binding represents an entirely new function.',\n",

In this study, we prepared and purified high amounts of recombinant large NT and large NN using the Drosophila S2 cell expression system. The binding and pharmacological properties of recombinant large peptides were characterized and compared to those of NT and NN using either COS cells transfected with the human subtype-1 NT receptor (hNTS1) or the human colon adenocarcinoma HT29 cell line that endogenously expresses hNTS1. Furthermore, the metabolic stability of the large peptides, when exposed to HT29 cells, was compared to that of NT and NN. Both large NT and large NN were able to bind to and activate hNTS1 with potencies that were approximately 10 times lower than that of their small counterpart. In addition, the large forms proved to be far less sensitive to degradation than the small peptides. Taken together, these data suggest that the large forms might represent endogenous, long-lasting activators of hNTS1 in a number of physiopathological situations.',\n",

VPAC(1)/G-protein complexes were solubilized from membranes and copurified. Receptor and Galpha-proteins were detected in eluates using (125)I-VIP labeling and immunoblotting, respectively.

Pretreatment of membranes with VIP increased the level of all G-proteins copurifying with VPAC(1). Immunoaffinity chromatography also revealed VPAC(1) receptor precoupling to G-protein in the absence of VIP pretreatment. This was confirmed using a cross-linking procedure to capture VIP receptor/G-protein complexes in the native membrane milieu prior to solubilization.

The HB-EGF precursor within this complex is processed by MMP-7, and the resulting mature HB-EGF engages and activates its receptor, ErbB4, leading to, among other events, cell survival. In CD44(-/-) mice, postpartum uterine involution is accelerated and maintenance of lactation is impaired. In both uterine and mammary epithelia of these mice, MMP-7 localization is altered and pro-HB-EGF processing as well as ErbB4 activation are decreased.

Another member of this family, dentin matrix protein 1, is shown in this paper to be very similar to osteopontin in that it can bind strongly to Factor H (K(a) approximately 1 nm) and block the lytic activity through either the vitronectin receptor (alpha(V)beta(3) integrin) or CD44. Binding of Factor H to SIBLING localized to the cells surface was demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Extensive overlapping fragment analyses suggests that both dentin matrix protein 1 and osteopontin interact with cell surface CD44 through their amino termini. Similar fragments of bone sialoprotein, like the intact protein, did not functionally interact with CD44. All three proteins are shown to act in conjunction with Factor I, a serum protease that, when complexed to appropriate cofactors, stops the lytic pathway by digesting the bound C3b in a series of proteolytic steps. These results show that at least three members of this family confer membrane cofactor protein-like activity (MCP or CD46) upon cells expressing RGD-binding integrins or CD44.

Within the immune system, expression of the HSPG syndecan-1 (CD138) is characteristic of terminally differentiated B cells, ie, plasma cells, and their malignant counterpart, multiple myeloma (MM). This study explored the hypothesis that syndecan-1 might promote growth factor signaling and tumor growth in MM. For this purpose, the interaction was studied between syndecan-1 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a putative paracrine and autocrine regulator of MM growth. The study demonstrates that syndecan-1 is capable of binding HGF and that this growth factor is indeed a potent stimulator of MM survival and proliferation. Importantly, the interaction of HGF with heparan sulfate moieties on syndecan-1 strongly promotes HGF-mediated signaling, resulting in enhanced activation of Met, the receptor tyrosine kinase for HGF. Moreover, HGF binding to syndecan-1 promotes activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B and RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, signaling routes that have been implicated in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation, respectively. These results identify syndecan-1 as a functional coreceptor for HGF that promotes HGF/Met signaling in MM cells, thus suggesting a novel function for syndecan-1 in MM tumorigenesis.',\n",

This study was designed to identify the presence and action of CT-1 and its receptor complex, glycoprotein130 (gp130) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor, on cardiac fibroblast growth in cultured adult canine cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, we investigated the interaction between CT-1/gp130/LIF receptor and ET-1/endothelin type A (ET(A)) receptor axis.

CT-1 and gp130/LIF receptor were widely present in the cytoplasm of the cardiac fibroblasts. Exogenous CT-1 markedly stimulated [(3)H]thymidine and [(3)H]proline incorporations (P<0.01), with accumulation of cells in the S phase.

TGF-beta initiates receptor assembly by binding with high affinity to the type II receptor. Here, we present the 2.15 A crystal structure of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human TGF-beta type II receptor (ecTbetaR2) in complex with human TGF-beta3. ecTbetaR2 interacts with homodimeric TGF-beta3 by binding identical finger segments at opposite ends of the growth factor. Relative to the canonical 'closed' conformation previously observed in ligand structures across the superfamily, ecTbetaR2-bound TGF-beta3 shows an altered arrangement of its monomeric subunits, designated the 'open' conformation. The mode of TGF-beta3 binding shown by ecTbetaR2 is compatible with both ligand conformations. This, in addition to the predicted mode for TGF-beta binding to the type I receptor ectodomain (ecTbetaR1), suggests an assembly mechanism in which ecTbetaR1 and ecTbetaR2 bind at adjacent positions on the ligand surface and directly contact each other via protein--protein interactions.\",\n",

In the current study we provide evidence indicating an expanded role for LRP in modulating cellular signaling events. Our results show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB induces a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP cytoplasmic domain in a process dependent on PDGF receptor activation and c-Src family kinase activity. Other growth factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, were unable to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP. The basis for this selectivity may result from the ability of LRP to bind PDGFBB, because surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated that only PDGF, and not basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor-1, bound to purified LRP immobilized on a sensor chip. The use of LRP mini-receptor mutants as well as in vitro phosphorylation studies demonstrated that the tyrosine located within the second NPXY motif found in the LRP cytoplasmic domain is the primary site of tyrosine phosphorylation by Src and Src family kinases. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of LRPs cytoplasmic domain results in increased association of the adaptor protein Shc with LRP and that Shc recognizes the second NPXY motif within LRPs cytoplasmic domain. In the accompanying paper, Boucher et al. (Boucher, P., Liu, P. V., Gotthardt, M., Hiesberger, T., Anderson, R. G. W., and Herz, J. (2002) J. Biol.

We report a study of alpha2 VWFA domain in which residue E318, which lies outside the collagen binding site, is mutated to tryptophan, showing that this is a gain-of-function mutation. Recombinant alpha2-E318W VWFA domain showed elevated and specific binding to collagen I compared with the wild-type. Side chain hydrophobicity was important for the gain-of-function as elevated binding was seen with E318I and E318Y, but not with E318R. The E318W mutation had additional effects on VWFA domain properties as alpha2-E318W VWFA domain differed from the wild-type in its cation preferences for ligand binding and in binding to monoclonal antibody JA203, which bound at a site distal to E318. The gain-of-function effect was not restricted to binding to collagen I as alpha2-E318W also showed elevated binding to collagen IV, collagen I C-propeptide, laminin and E-cadherin. Binding to these ligands was inhibited by collagen peptide containing the GFOGER motif, indicating that these bound to the VWFA domain by a similar mechanism to collagen I. These data indicate that residue E318 plays a novel and important role in modulating alpha2 VWFA domain--ligand binding and may be involved in the conformational changes associated with its regulation.',\n",

The latter is the mutations of aquaporin-2(AQP-2) water channel, which have had 11 mutations. The functional analysis of V2 receptor mutations has resulted in two abnormalities. The mutated receptors retain in cytoplasma and can not fold into plasma membrane in most of AVP V2 receptor mutations. The other is that the mutated receptors, localized in plasma membrane, can not either bind to its ligand AVP or transduce its signal to the post-receptor pathway. Also, the mutated AQP-2 is functionally divided into two types of abnormality. In 10 out of 11 mutations, the mutated AQP-2 is located in endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, and can not be translocated into apical plasma membrane. The mutated AQP-2 should functionally produce water permeability, if it could be routed into plasma membrane. Only one mutation of AQP-2 (T125M and G175R) can be folded in apical membrane, but it does not produce water permeability.

Secreted human TIP39 is identical to the previously isolated bovine TIP39, whereas mouse TIP39 differs by four amino acids. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that TIP39, PTH, and PTHrP may have evolved from a common ancestor. Synthetic human and mouse TIP39 showed indistinguishable potencies [EC(50): 0.54 (human) vs. 0.74 nM (mouse)] at the human PTH2-receptor stably expressed in LLCPK(1) cells; furthermore, TIP-(9-39) was an inhibitor of cAMP accumulation stimulated by either [Tyr(34)]PTH(1-34)amide or human/bovine TIP39. In the mouse, an approximately 4.5-kb mRNA encoding TIP39 was identified by Northern blot analysis in testis and, less abundantly, in liver and kidney, whereas other tissues revealed additional smaller transcripts. In situ hybridizations revealed TIP39 expression in seminiferous tubuli and several brain regions, including nucleus ruber, nucleus centralis pontis, and nucleus subparafascicularis thalami. Because PTH2 receptor expression was previously shown to be highest in brain, pancreas, and testis, our findings are consistent with the notion that TIP39 is a neuropeptide which may also have a role in spermatogenesis.',\n",

Nevertheless, a major class of ligand(s) is present in the retinal basal lamina and glial endfeet, the potent native growth substrate for retinal axons. We demonstrate here that cPTPsigma is a heparin-binding protein and that its basal lamina ligands include the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) agrin and collagen XVIII. These molecules interact with high affinity with cPTPsigma in vitro, and this binding is totally dependent upon their heparan sulfate chains. Using molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis, a binding site for heparin and heparan sulfate was identified in the first immunoglobulin-like domain of cPTPsigma. HSPGs are therefore a novel class of heterotypic ligand for cPTPsigma, suggesting that cPTPsigma signaling in axons and growth cones is directly responsive to matrix-associated cues.',\n",

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments, however, failed to detect binding of ANGPTL3 to the Tie2 receptor. A molecular model of the FBN-like domain of ANGPTL3 was generated and predicted potential binding to integrins. This hypothesis was experimentally confirmed by the finding that recombinant ANGPTL3 bound to alpha(v)beta(3) and induced integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-dependent haptotactic endothelial cell adhesion and migration and stimulated signal transduction pathways characteristic for integrin activation, including phosphorylation of Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and focal adhesion kinase. When tested in the rat corneal assay, ANGPTL3 strongly induced angiogenesis with comparable magnitude as observed for vascular endothelial growth factor-A. Moreover, the C-terminal FBN-like domain alone was sufficient to induce endothelial cell adhesion and in vivo angiogenesis. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ANGPTL3 is the first member of the angiopoietin-like family of secreted factors binding to integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and suggest a possible role in the regulation of angiogenesis.',\n",

Expression of prokineticin receptors in heterologous systems shows that these receptors bind to and are activated by nanomolar concentrations of recombinant prokineticins. Activation of prokineticin receptors leads to mobilization of calcium, stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover, and activation of p44/p42 MAPK signaling pathways that are consistent with the effects of prokineticins on smooth muscle contraction and angiogenesis. mRNA expression analysis reveals that prokineticin receptors are expressed in gastrointestinal organs, endocrine glands, and other tissues.',\n",

Here the extracellular domain of IFNAR2 (IFNAR2-EC), a soluble 25 kDa IFN-binding polypeptide, and its complex with IFN-alpha 2 were studied using multidimensional NMR. IFNAR2-EC is comprised of two fibronectin-III (FN-III) domains connected by a helical hinge region. The deduced global fold was utilized to improve the alignment of IFNAR2-EC against structurally related receptors and to model its structure. A striking feature of IFNAR2-EC is the limited and localized deviations in chemical shifts exhibited upon ligand binding, observed for only 15% of its backbone (1)H and (15)N nuclei. Analysis of these deviations maps the IFN-alpha 2 binding site upon IFNAR2-EC to a contiguous surface on the N-terminal domain, including the S3-S4 loop (residues 44-53), the S5-S6 loop and S6 beta-strand (residues 74-82), and the S7 beta-strand and the hinge region (residues 95-105). The C-terminal domain contributes only marginally to ligand binding, and no change in the hypothesized interdomain interface is observed. The proposed binding domain encompasses all residues implicated by mutagenesis studies in IFN binding, and suggests adjacent residues cooperate in forming the binding surface. D(2)O-exchange experiments indicate that binding of IFN-alpha2 induces tightening of the N-terminal domain of IFNAR2-EC. This increase in receptor rigidity may play an important role in initiating the intracellular stage of the IFN signaling cascade.',\n",

Here we describe the cellular effects of these peptides using immortalized human kidney epithelial (IHKE-1) cells with properties of the proximal tubule, analyzed with the slow-whole-cell patch clamp technique. Uroguanylin (10 or 100 nm) either hyperpolarized or depolarized membrane voltages (V(m)). Guanylin and STa (both 10 or 100 nm), as well as 8-Br-cGMP (100 microm), depolarized V(m). All peptide effects were absent in the presence of 1 mm Ba(2+). Uroguanylin and guanylin changed V(m) pH dependently. Pertussis toxin (1 microg/ml, 24 h) inhibited hyperpolarizations caused by uroguanylin. Depolarizations caused by guanylin and uroguanylin were blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (10 microm). All three peptides increased cellular cGMP. mRNA for GC-C was detected in IHKE-1 cells and in isolated human proximal tubules. In IHKE-1 cells GC-C was also detected by immunostaining. These findings suggest that GC-C is probably the receptor for guanylin and STa.

In the present study, the molecular expression of PACAP receptor isoforms and the signaling pathways involved in the insulin secretory effect of PACAP were investigated in isolated rat and mouse pancreatic islets. mRNA encoding PAC1-short, -hop, and -very short variants, as well as VPAC1 and VPAC2, were expressed in pancreatic islets. PACAP and VIP were equipotent in potentiating glucose-induced insulin release. Both peptides were also equipotent in increasing cAMP production, but PACAP was more efficient than VIP. Unlike carbachol, PACAP and VIP had no effect on inositol phosphate production. In the PAC1-deficient mouse, the insulinotropic effect of PACAP was reduced, and its differential effect on cAMP production was abolished, whereas the effects of VIP remained unchanged. These results clearly show that the insulinotropic effect of PACAP involved both VPAC and PAC1.

Over-expression of a soluble PDGF beta-receptor as well as a mutated form of the beta-receptor, unable to bind PI-3K, diminished GAG synthesis in fetal lung fibroblasts subsequent to PDGF-BB stimulation. The PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin blocked PDGF-BB-induced Akt activity as well as significantly diminishing PDGF-BB-mediated GAG synthesis. Expression of dominant-negative PI-3K also abrogated Akt activity and GAG synthesis. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative Akt abrogated endogenous Akt activity, Rab3D phosphorylation and GAG synthesis, whereas expression of constitutively activated Akt stimulated Rab3D phosphorylation and GAG synthesis in the absence of PDGF-BB. Over-expression of wild-type PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10) inhibited Akt activity and concomitantly attenuated GAG synthesis in fibroblasts stimulated with PDGF-BB. These data suggest that Akt is an integral protein involved in PDGF-BB-mediated GAG regulation in fetal lung fibroblasts.',\n",

These are transmembrane proteins composed of a single transmembrane domain, a variable extracellular natriuretic peptide-binding domain, and a more conserved intracellular kinase homology domain (KHD) and catalytic domain. GC-A, the receptor for ANP and BNP, also named natriuretic peptide receptor-A or -1 (NPR-A or NPR- 1), has been studied widely.

Correct chain association into a triple-helical conformation was confirmed by limited pepsin digestion and CD spectroscopy. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy of the ectodomain revealed it to be a 150-nm rod with two flexible hinges separating 31-, 52-, and 68-nm portions. The rods represent the collagenous domains 1-3, and the hinges coincide with the non-collagenous domains 2 and 3. By using surface plasmon resonance analysis, the ectodomain showed interaction with immobilized fibronectin, nidogen-2, and perlecan with K(D) values in the nanomolar range. The binding sites of type XIII collagen for fibronectin were localized to the collagenous domains, whereas the binding activities for nidogen-2 and perlecan resided in the pepsin-sensitive portions of the ectodomain. Furthermore, the ectodomain bound significantly to heparin, which also inhibited shedding of the ectodomain in insect cell cultures.

The expression of chemokine receptors by intrinsic renal cells such as mesangial cells (MC) suggests an expanded role for chemokine-chemokine receptor biology in local immunomodulation and potentially glomerular homeostasis. By immunohistochemistry we found the chemokine receptor CCR7 expressed in a mesangial pattern while the CCR7 ligand SLC/CCL21 showed a podocyte-specific expression. CCR7 expression was further characterized by RT-PCR, RNase protection assays, and FACS analysis of cultured human MC, and was found to be constitutively present. Real-time PCR of microdissected glomeruli confirmed the expression of SLC/CCL21. A functional role for CCR7 was demonstrated for human MC migration and proliferation. A protective effect of SLC/CCL21 was shown for MC survival in Fas Ab-induced apoptosis. Finally, \"wound healing\" was enhanced in the presence of SLC/CCL21 in an in vitro injury model. The constitutive glomerular expression of CCR7 and its ligand SLC/CCL21 in adjacent cell types of the human kidney suggests novel biological functions of this chemokine/chemokine receptor pair and a potential role in processes involved in glomerular homeostasis and regeneration.',\n",

To test such hypothesis, it will be necessary to develop experimental animal models for the manipulation of U-II/UT receptor system. The goal of this study was to clone mouse and primate preproU-II and UT for pharmacological profiling. Monkey and mouse preproU-II genes were identified to encode 123 and 125 amino acids. Monkey and mouse UT receptors were 389, and 386 amino acids, respectively. Genomic organization of mouse genes showed that the preproU-II has four exons, while the UT receptor has one exon. Although initially viewed by many exclusively as cardiovascular targets, the present study demonstrates expression of mouse and monkey U-II/UT receptor mRNA in extra-vascular tissue including lung, pancreas, skeletal muscle, kidney and liver. Ligand binding studies showed that [125I]h U-II bound to a single sites to the cloned receptors in a saturable/high affinity manner (Kd 654+/-154 and 214+/-65 pM and Bmax of 1011+/-125 and 497+/-68 fmol mg-1 for mouse and monkey UT receptors, respectively).

Activation of VPAC1 has been implicated in elevating glucose output, whereas activation of VPAC2 may be involved in insulin secretion. A hypothesis that a VPAC2-selective agonist would enhance glucose disposal by stimulating insulin secretion without causing increased hepatic glucose production was tested using a novel selective agonist of VPAC2. This agonist, BAY 55-9837, was generated through site-directed mutagenesis based on sequence alignments of PACAP, VIP, and related analogs. The peptide bound to VPAC2 with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 0.65 nmol/l and displayed >100-fold selectivity over VPAC1. BAY 55-9837 stimulated glucose-dependent insulin secretion in isolated rat and human pancreatic islets, increased insulin synthesis in purified rat islets, and caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma insulin levels in fasted rats, with a half-maximal stimulatory concentration of 3 pmol/kg. Continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion of the peptide reduced the glucose area under the curve following an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. The peptide had effects on intestinal water retention and mean arterial blood pressure in rats, but only at much higher doses.

We found that these opposing responses arise from interactions of TSP1 with two different T cell receptors. The integrin alpha4beta1 recognizes an LDVP sequence in the NH2-terminal domain of TSP1 and was required for stimulation of T cell adhesion, chemotaxis, and matrix metalloproteinase gene expression by TSP1. Recognition of TSP1 by T cells depended on the activation state of alpha4beta1 integrin, and TSP1 inhibited interaction of activated alpha4beta1 integrin on T cells with its counter receptor vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. The alpha4beta1 integrin recognition site is conserved in TSP2. A recombinant piece of TSP2 containing this sequence replicated the alpha4beta1 integrin-dependent activities of TSP1. The beta1 integrin recognition sites in TSP1, however, were neither necessary nor sufficient for inhibition of T cell proliferation and T cell antigen receptor signaling by TSP1. A second TSP1 receptor, CD47, was not required for some stimulatory responses to TSP1 but played a significant role in its T cell antigen receptor antagonist and antiproliferative activities. Modulating the relative expression or function of these two TSP receptors could therefore alter the direction or magnitude of T cell responses to TSPs.',\n",

This segregation of the receptor is due to its interaction with extracellular matrix (ECM) and specially with fibronectin. The TSHR, which interacts with the ECM, is known to undergo cleavage by a matrix metalloprotease. The homologous LH receptor, which does not interact with ECM, is not cleaved. The attachment to the ECM modifies the functional properties of the receptor: it increases adenylate cyclase stimulation by hormone, whereas PLC stimulation is not modified. Furthermore, the constitutive activity of the TSHR is only observed in attached cells, suggesting that it is dependent on TSHR interaction with the ECM. Thus, aside from its classical properties of hormone binding and signalization through G proteins, the TSHR is also involved in cell-matrix interactions, which modulate its functional properties.',\n",

Therefore, we investigated the effect of platelet factor 4 (PF4), a cationic protein released in high concentration by activated platelets, on the uptake and degradation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) via the LDL receptor (LDL-R). LDL-R-dependent binding, internalization, and degradation of LDL by cultured cells were inhibited 50%, 80%, and 80%, respectively, on addition of PF4. PF4 bound specifically to the ligand-binding domain of recombinant soluble LDL-R (half-maximal binding 0.5 microg/mL PF4) and partially (approximately 50%) inhibited the binding of LDL. Inhibition of internalization and degradation by PF4 required the presence of cell-associated proteoglycans, primarily those rich in chondroitin sulfate. PF4 variants with impaired heparin binding lacked the capacity to inhibit LDL. PF4, soluble LDL-R, and LDL formed ternary complexes with cell-surface proteoglycans. PF4 induced the retention of LDL/LDL-R complexes on the surface of human fibroblasts in multimolecular clusters unassociated with coated pits, as assessed by immuno-electron microscopy. These studies demonstrate that PF4 inhibits the catabolism of LDL in vitro in part by competing for binding to LDL-R, by promoting interactions with cell-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and by disrupting the normal endocytic trafficking of LDL/LDL-R complexes. Retention of LDL on cell surfaces may facilitate proatherogenic modifications and support an expanded role for platelets in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.',\n",

Anti-Myc antibodies immunoprecipitated 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-PlGF-2 in the presence of the b1b2 but not of the a1a2 and c domains. Neither b1 nor b2 alone was capable of binding 125I-VEGF165. In competition experiments, VEGF165 competed PlGF-2 binding to the NRP1 b1b2 domain, suggesting that the binding sites of VEGF165 and PlGF-2 overlap. The presence of the a1a2 domain greatly enhanced VEGF165, but not PlGF-2 binding to b1b2. Heparin enhanced the binding of both 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-PlGF-2 to the b1b2 domain by 20- and 4-fold, respectively. A heparin chain of at least 20-24 monosaccharides was necessary for binding. In addition, the b1b2 domain of NRP1 could bind heparin directly, requiring heparin oligomers of at least 8 monosaccharide units. It was concluded that an intact b1b2 domain serves as the VEGF165-, PlGF-2-, and heparin-binding sites in NRP1, and that heparin is a critical component for regulating VEGF165 and PlGF-2 interactions with NRP1 by physically interacting with both receptor and ligands.',\n",

In this study, we found that DcR3.Fc profoundly modulated dendritic cell differentiation and maturation from CD14(+) monocytes, including the up-regulation of CD86/B7.2, and the down-regulation of CD40, CD54/ICAM-1, CD80/B7.1, CD1a, and HLA-DR. Moreover, DcR3-treated dendritic cells suppressed CD4(+) T cell proliferation in an allogeneic MLR and up-regulated IL-4 secretion of CD4(+)CD45RA(+) T cells.

We used RT-PCR, Northern blotting and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that CCR3 is absent from the testes of both species, whereas CCR5 and CXCR4 are present on the resident testicular macrophages in the interstitial space but not in the germ cell line. All of the human testicular macrophages expressed the markers CD45 and MAC387 and most also expressed CD4.

Using a proteomic approach based on peptide affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting, we have identified 15 proteins that interact with the C- terminal tail of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C (5-HT(2C)) receptor, a GPCR. These proteins include several synaptic multidomain proteins containing one or several PDZ domains (PSD95 and the proteins of the tripartite complex Veli3-CASK-Mint1), proteins of the actin/spectrin cytoskeleton and signalling proteins. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that 5-HT(2C) receptors interact with PSD95 and the Veli3-CASK-Mint1 complex in vivo. Electron microscopy also indicated a synaptic enrichment of Veli3 and 5-HT(2C) receptors and their colocalization in microvilli of choroidal cells.

Substitution of Asn(111) with glycine, which is known to cause constitutive receptor activation by disrupting its interaction with the seventh transmembrane helix (TM VII), selectively increased the potency of Ang IV (900-fold) and angiotensin-(4-8), and leads to partial agonism of angiotensin-(5-8). Consistent with the need for the interaction between Arg(2) of Ang II and Ang III with Asp(281), substitution of this residue with alanine (D281A) decreased the peptide\\'s potency without affecting that of Ang IV. All effects of the D281A mutation were superseded by the N111G mutation. The increased affinity of Ang IV to the N111G mutant was also demonstrated by binding studies. A model is proposed in which the Arg(2)-Asp(281) interaction causes a conformational change in TM VII of the receptor, which, similar to the N111G mutation, eliminates the constraining intramolecular interaction between Asn(111) and TM VII. The receptor adopts a more relaxed conformation, allowing the binding of the C-terminal five residues of Ang II that switches this \"preactivated\" receptor into the fully active conformation.',\n",

(i) Nectins are adhesion molecules localized at adherens junctions in epithelial cells. (ii) Some nectins act as poliovirus or alpha-herpesvirus receptors (nectin1). (iii) Nectin1 mutations are involved in orofacial developmental abnormalities in humans. Adhesion properties of nectins are mediated by Ca(2+)-independent homophilic and heterophilic processes through ectodomain trans-interactions. We have described a nectin trans-hetero-interaction network: nectin3 binds to nectin1, nectin2, and PVR; nectin1 also binds to nectin4. In the present study we compared the affinities of the different trans-interactions mediated by nectin1. We found that the K(D) of nectin1/nectin3 and nectin1/nectin4 interactions is 1 and 100 nm, respectively, whereas the K(D) of the nectin1-mediated homophilic interaction is 1 microm. We show that nectin1/nectin3 and nectin1/nectin4 trans-hetero-interactions were mediated through trans V to V domain interactions, whereas C domains contributed to increase the affinity of the interaction. Nectin3 and nectin4 share a common binding region in the nectin1 V domain: (i) nectin3 strongly competed with nectin4 binding, (ii) nectin3 and nectin4 binding to nectin1 was reduced by a number of monoclonal antibodies directed against the nectin1 V domain, and (iii) the glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus-1 that binds to the V domain of nectin1 reduced nectin3 and nectin4 binding.

This study shows that full-length endoglin interacts with both TbetaRI and TbetaRII, independently of their kinase activation state or the presence of exogenous TGF-beta1. Truncated constructs encoding either the extracellular or the cytoplasmic domains of endoglin demonstrated that the association with the signaling receptors occurs through both extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. However, a more specific mapping revealed that the endoglin/TbetaRI interaction was different from that of endoglin/TbetaRII. TbetaRII interacts with the amino acid region 437-558 of the extracellular domain of endoglin, whereas TbetaRI interacts not only with the region 437-558 but also with the protein region located between amino acid 437 and the N terminus. Both TbetaRI and TbetaRII interact with the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin, but TbetaRI only interacts when the kinase domain is inactive, whereas TbetaRII remains associated in its active and inactive forms. Upon association, TbetaRI and TbetaRII phosphorylate the endoglin cytoplasmic domain, and then TbetaRI, but not TbetaRII, kinase dissociates from the complex. Conversely, endoglin expression results in an altered phosphorylation state of TbetaRII, TbetaRI, and downstream Smad proteins as well as a modulation of TGF-beta signaling, as measured by the reporter gene expression.

In this study, we demonstrated that both Cyr61 and CTGF are expressed in advanced atherosclerotic lesions of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Because monocyte adhesion and transmigration are important for atherosclerosis, wound healing, and inflammation, we examined the interaction of THP-1 monocytic cells and isolated peripheral blood monocytes with Cyr61 and CTGF. THP-1 cells and monocytes adhered to Cyr61- or CTGF-coated wells in an activation-dependent manner and this process was mediated primarily through integrin alpha(M)beta(2). Additionally, expression of alpha(M)beta(2) on human embryonic kidney 293 cells resulted in enhanced cell adhesion to Cyr61. Consistent with these data, a GST-fusion protein containing the I domain of the integrin alpha(M) subunit bound specifically to immobilized Cyr61 or CTGF. We have also investigated the requirement of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as coreceptors for monocyte adhesion to Cyr61. Pretreatment of monocytes with heparin or heparinase I resulted in partial inhibition of cell adhesion to Cyr61. However, monocytes, but not fibroblasts, were capable of adhering to a Cyr61 mutant deficient in heparin binding activity.

Residues 165-179 of apoE may act as a molecular switch whereby these residues are unstructured in the absence of lipids and prevent interaction with the LDL receptor. In the presence of lipids, these residues become helical resulting in a receptor-active conformation of the protein. Furthermore, the electrostatic characteristics and geometric features of apoE-(126-183) suggest that apoE binds to the LDL receptor by interacting with more than one of the receptor ligand-binding repeats.',\n",

This discovery emphasizes the role of the cell surface in angiotensin II generation and opens new perspectives on the tissue renin-angiotensin system and on renin effects independent of angiotensin II.',\n",
       " '12045258': 'Human thyrotropin (TSH), luteotropin (LH), follitropin (FSH), and chorionic gonadotropin are members of the heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone family. The common alpha subunit forms noncovalent heterodimers with different beta subunits. Two novel human glycoprotein hormonelike genes, alpha2 (A2) and beta5 (B5), recently have been identified. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, the two subunits were found as potential heterodimerization partners. Immunological analyses confirmed the heterodimerization of A2 and B5 in transfected cells and their colocalization in the anterior pituitary. Recombinant A2/B5 heterodimeric glycoproteins, purified using cation exchange and size fractionation chromatography, activated human TSH receptors, but not LH and FSH receptors, and showed high affinity to TSH receptors in a radioligand receptor assay. The heterodimer also stimulated cAMP production and thymidine incorporation by cultured thyroid cells and increased serum thyroxine levels in TSH-suppressed rats in vivo. This new heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone was named as thyrostimulin based on its thyroid-stimulating activity. The expression of thyrostimulin in the anterior pituitary known to express TSH receptors suggested a paracrine mechanism. The present discovery of a new ligand based on genomic approaches could facilitate the understanding of the physiological roles of extra-thyroid TSH receptor systems and the structural-functional basis of receptor signaling by related glycoprotein hormones.',\n",

NOV associates with the epidermal growth factor-like repeats of Notch1 by the CT (C-terminal cysteine knot) domain. The promoters of HES1 and HES5, which are the downstream transducers of Notch signaling, were activated by NOV. Expressions of NOV and Notch1 were concomitant in the presomitic mesoderm and later in the myocytes and chondrocytes, suggesting their synergistic effects in mesenchymal cell differentiation. In C2/4 myogenic cells, elevated expression of NOV led to down-regulation of MyoD and myogenin, resulting in inhibition of myotube formation. These results indicate that NOV-Notch1 association exerts a positive effect on Notch signaling and consequently suppresses myogenesis.',\n",
       " '12050670': 'The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins mediate cell cell interactions during cell growth and differentiation in both embryos and adults. Canonical Wnt signalling by way of the beta-catenin pathway is transduced by two receptor families. Frizzled proteins and lipoprotein-receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) bind Wnts and transmit their signal by stabilizing intracellular beta-catenin. Wnt/beta-catenin signalling is inhibited by the secreted protein Dickkopf1 (Dkk1), a member of a multigene family, which induces head formation in amphibian embryos. Dkk1 has been shown to inhibit Wnt signalling by binding to and antagonizing LRP5/6. Here we show that the transmembrane proteins Kremen1 and Kremen2 are high-affinity Dkk1 receptors that functionally cooperate with Dkk1 to block Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Kremen2 forms a ternary complex with Dkk1 and LRP6, and induces rapid endocytosis and removal of the Wnt receptor LRP6 from the plasma membrane. The results indicate that Kremen1 and Kremen2 are components of a membrane complex modulating canonical Wnt signalling through LRP6 in vertebrates.',\n",

We have previously shown that a receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4 is predominantly expressed on human erythroid progenitors in bone marrow. EphB4 is expressed in approximately 45% of hematopoietic progenitor cells, which are CD34-positive and c-Kit-positive in human umbilical cord blood (hUCB). The transmembrane ligand for EphB4 or ephrin-B2 is expressed on bone marrow stromal cells and arterial endothelial cells. When such EphB4-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells were co-cultured with stromal cells which express ephrin-B2, they were immediately detached from stromal cells and differentiated to mature erythroid cells. At that time, expression of EphB4 immediately down-regulated. In contrast, on ephrin-B2 non-expressing stromal cells, they remained EphB4-positive cells and the generated number of mature erythroid cells was less than that on ephrin-B2 expressing stromal cells. Additionally, ephrin-B2 expression on endothelial cells up-regulated under hypoxic condition. Taken together, we propose that one of the molecular cues that regulate erythropoiesis is ephrin-B2 on stromal cells.',\n",

N-terminal fragments, Ala-analogs of motilin, and motilides were tested in a cell line that expresses the cloned human motilin receptor and apoaequorin. Full potency to induce calcium fluxes was obtained with N-terminal fragments of 14 amino acids. Motilin fragments 1-14 in which residues 1 (Phe), 4 (Ile), and 7 (Tyr) were replaced by Ala showed the largest reduction in potency. Only motilides with an enol configuration had markedly higher potencies compared to erythromycin A. The potencies to induce Ca(2+) fluxes correlated strongly with rabbit binding and contractility data, suggesting that the cloned receptor is indeed the motilin receptor, responsible for contractile effects. Conservation of the motilin pharmacophore in evolution indicates an important physiological role of motilin.',\n",

EG-VEGF/prokineticin 1 and prokineticin 2 induced a transient increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) with nanomolar potency in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing EG-VEGF/PK-R1 and -R2 and bind to these cells with high affinity and with different receptor selectivity. EG-VEGF/prokineticins provoke rapid phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase and DNA synthesis in the bovine adrenal capillary endothelial cells (BACE). The mRNAs of both EG-VEGF/PK-R1 and -R2 were expressed in BACE. The identification of the receptors for EG-VEGF/prokineticins may provide a novel molecular basis for the regulation of angiogenesis in endocrine glands.',\n",

Overall agonist binding affinities were increased for both fusion constructs when compared to the wild type receptor. [35 S]GTPgammaS binding was performed on pertussis toxin treated cells to monitor coupling efficiency of the fusion constructs. Upon agonist addition hMOR-C351I Gi1 a exhibited an activation profile similar to the non-fused receptor while hMOR-C352I Gi2 alpha was poorly activated. Interestingly no correlation could be drawn between agonist binding affinity and efficacy. Upon agonist addition, forskolin-stimulated cAMP production, as measured using a reporter gene assay, was inhibited by signals transduced via the fused Gi1 alpha and Gi2 alpha mainly. In contrast both fusion constructs were able to initiate ERK-MAPK phosphorylation via coupling to endogenous G proteins only. In conclusion our data indicate that hMOR couples more efficiently to Gi1 alpha than Gi2 alpha and that the coupling efficacy is clearly agonist-dependent.',\n",

In addition to myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and Nogo-A, available evidence suggests the existence of additional inhibitors in CNS myelin. We show here that a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored CNS myelin protein, oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), is a potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. Like Nogo-A, OMgp contributes significantly to the inhibitory activity associated with CNS myelin. To further elucidate the mechanisms that mediate this inhibitory activity of OMgp, we screened an expression library and identified the Nogo receptor (NgR) as a high-affinity OMgp-binding protein. Cleavage of NgR and other GPI-linked proteins from the cell surface renders axons of dorsal root ganglia insensitive to OMgp. Introduction of exogenous NgR confers OMgp responsiveness to otherwise insensitive neurons. Thus, OMgp is an important inhibitor of neurite outgrowth that acts through NgR and its associated receptor complex. Interfering with the OMgp/NgR pathway may allow lesioned axons to regenerate after injury in vivo.',\n",
       " '12070135': 'We have previously reported that junctional adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2) adheres to T cells through heterotypic interactions with JAM3. An examination of the cation dependence of JAM2 adhesion to HSB cells revealed a Mn(2+)-enhanced binding component indicative of integrin involvement. Using neutralizing integrin antibodies, we have defined an interaction between JAM2 and alpha(4)beta(1) in T cells. The interaction is readily amenable to drug intervention as demonstrated by the ability of TBC 772, an alpha(4)-specific inhibitor, to attenuate the Mn(2+)-enhanced component. Intriguingly, the engagement of alpha(4)beta(1) by JAM2 is only enabled following prior adhesion of JAM2 with JAM3 and is not detectable in cells where JAM3 expression is absent. Supporting this observation, we show that neutralizing JAM3 serum and soluble JAM3 ectodomain inhibit not only JAM2 binding to JAM3 but also prevent JAM2/alpha(4)beta(1) interactions in T cells. We further define the first Ig-like fold of JAM2 as being competent in binding both JAM3 and alpha(4)beta(1) counter-receptors. Mutagenesis of the only acidic residue in the C-D loop of this Ig fold, namely Asp-82, has no bearing on alpha(4)beta(1) interactions, and thus JAM2 deviates somewhat from the mechanism used by other immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules to engage integrin.',\n",

In receptor binding studies, performed using CHO cells expressing the recombinant human NC receptor (CHO(hOP4)) and in rat cerebral cortex membranes, [(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2), [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2), and [(pCN)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) displayed higher affinity than NC(1-13)NH(2). The affinity of [(pCl)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) was essentially identical to that of NC(1-13)NH(2), while the remaining compounds displayed reduced affinity. In a series of functional assays (stimulation of GTPgammaS binding in CHO(hOP4)cells and rat cerebral cortex membranes and inhibition of cAMP accumulation in CHO(hOP4) cells), the para substituted analogues behaved as full agonists (with the exception of [(pOH)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) which acted as a partial agonist in the GTPgammaS binding assays) with the following rank order potency:[(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) and [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) were either inactive or displayed micromolar potencies in cAMP accumulation experiments performed on cells expressing classical opioid receptors. All compounds were full agonists in isolated tissues from various species (guinea pig ileum, mouse colon and mouse/rat vas deferens) with the exception of [(pOH)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) which displayed partial agonist/weak antagonist activities. The rank order of potency was similar to that found in the other assays. The effects of all analogues were not modified by naloxone.

This study further supports the notion that Phe(4) of NC is the critical residue for receptor occupation and activation. Moreover, as part of this study, we have identified two novel, highly potent and selective agonists for the OP(4) receptor, [(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) and [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2).',\n",

In situ binding assays were performed to determine the expression of chemokine binding sites from rheumatoid (n = 10) and non-rheumatoid (n = 10) synovia. The expression of DARC protein and mRNA was examined by immunohistochemistry and northern blotting. The involvement of DARC in chemokine binding was studied by incubating sections with blocking antibodies to DARC (Fy3 and 6), to find out if these reduced 125I-IL-8 binding. Binding of radiolabelled chemokines IL-8, RANTES, MCP-1, but not MIP-1alpha, was found on venular endothelial cells in inflamed synovia from both rheumatoid and non-rheumatoid patients. Excess homologous unlabelled chemokine displaced binding and excess unlabelled RANTES could displace radiolabelled IL-8 binding. DARC protein expression was demonstrated on venular endothelial cells in all samples and DARC mRNA could be detected in extracts from synovia. There was downregulation of DARC protein and mRNA in rheumatoid samples. Binding of IL-8 to both rheumatoid and non-rheumatoid synovia was significantly reduced in the presence of anti-DARC Fy3 and Fy6 monoclonal antibodies. These findings show the expression of a multispecific chemokine binding site on the inflamed synovial endothelium, with evidence for involvement of DARC. This suggests a potential role for DARC in the inflammatory processes involved in synovitis.',\n",

Almost all chemokine receptors contain cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain and in the first, second, and third extracellular loops. In this report, we have studied the importance of all cysteine residues in the CCR6 sequence using site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical techniques. Like all G protein-coupled receptors, mutating disulfide bond-forming cysteines in the first (Cys118) and second (Cys197) extracellular loops in CCR6 led to complete elimination of receptor activity, which for CCR6 was also associated with the accumulation of the receptor intracellularly. Although two additional cysteines in the N-terminal region and the third extracellular loop, which are present in almost all chemokine receptors, are presumed to form a disulfide bond, this has not been demonstrated experimentally for any of these receptors. We found that mutating the cysteines in the N-terminal domain (Cys36) and the third extracellular loop (Cys288) neither significantly affected receptor surface expression nor completely abolished receptor function. Importantly, contrary to several previous reports, we demonstrated directly that instead of forming a disulfide bond, the N-terminal cysteine (Cys36) and the third extracellular loop cysteine (Cys288) contain free SH groups. The cysteine residues (Cys36 and Cys288), rather than forming a disulfide bond, may be important per se. We propose that CCR6 forms only a disulfide bond between the first (Cys118) and second (Cys197) extracellular loops, which confines a helical bundle together with the N-terminus adjacent to the third extracellular loop, creating the structural organization critical for ligand binding and therefore for receptor signaling.',\n",

To investigate the structural requirements for the cellular cholesterol efflux mediated by ABCA1, we have determined the topology of these two domains and generated transporters harboring five naturally occurring missense mutations in them. These mutants, unlike wild type ABCA1, produced little or no apoA-I-stimulated cholesterol efflux when transfected into 293 cells, establishing their causality in Tangier disease. Because all five mutant proteins were well expressed and detectable on the plasma membrane, their interaction with the ABCA1 ligand, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, was measured using bifunctional cross-linking agents. Four of five mutants had a marked decline in cross-linking to apoA-I, whereas one (W590S) retained full cross-linking activity. Cross-linking of apoA-I was temperature-dependent, rapid in onset, and detectable with both lipid- and water-soluble cross-linking agents. These results suggest that apoA-I-stimulated cholesterol efflux cannot occur without a direct interaction between the apoprotein and critical residues in two extracellular loops of ABCA1. The behavior of the W590S mutant indicates that although binding of apoA-I by ABCA1 may be necessary, it is not sufficient for stimulation of cholesterol efflux.',\n",

GPIb binds to the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (vWF-A1) at high blood shear, initiating platelet adhesion and contributing to the formation of a thrombus. To investigate the molecular basis of GPIb regulation and ligand binding, we have determined the structure of the N-terminal domain of the GPIb(alpha) chain (residues 1-279). This structure is the first determined from the cell adhesion/signaling class of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins and reveals the topology of the characteristic disulfide-bonded flanking regions. The fold consists of an N-terminal beta-hairpin, eight leucine-rich repeats, a disulfide-bonded loop, and a C-terminal anionic region. The structure also demonstrates a novel LRR motif in the form of an M-shaped arrangement of three tandem beta-turns. Negatively charged binding surfaces on the LRR concave face and anionic region indicate two-step binding kinetics to vWF-A1, which can be regulated by an unmasking mechanism involving conformational change of a key loop. Using molecular docking of the GPIb and vWF-A1 crystal structures, we were also able to model the GPIb.vWF-A1 complex.',\n",

However, these chimeras weakly bind to ErbB-3 alone. To further dissect the ligand binding selectivity of the ErbB network, we have applied the phage display technique to examine the role of the linear N-terminal region in EGF for interaction with ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers. A library of EGF variants was constructed in which residues 2, 3, and 4 were randomly mutated, followed by selection for binding to intact MDA-MB-453 cells that overexpress ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 but lack ErbB-1. Analysis of the selected phage EGF variants revealed clones with high binding affinity to ErbB-2/ErbB-3 while maintaining high affinity to ErbB-1. In these variants, Trp (or alternatively His) was almost exclusively present at position 2, while specific combinations of hydrophobic, basic, and small residues were found at positions 3 and 4. The mitogenic activity of the phage EGF variants corresponded with their relative binding affinity. Two of the selected EGF variants, EGF/WVS and EGF/WRS, were further characterized as recombinant proteins. In contrast to previously characterized chimeras of EGF with NRG-1 or TGF-alpha, these variants did not only show high binding affinity for ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers but also for ErbB-3 alone. These data show that the linear N-terminal region of EGF-like growth factors is directly involved in binding to ErbB-3.',\n",

Whereas E-cadherin is expressed in most epithelium and carcinomas, recent studies suggest that the up-regulation of other cadherin subtypes in carcinomas, such as N-cadherin, may function in cancer progression. We demonstrate that a signal transduction cascade links the N-cadherin.catenin adhesion complex to up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In suspension, aggregates of DU-145 cells, an E-cadherin expressing human prostate carcinoma line, survive loss of integrin-dependent adhesion by a different anti-apoptotic signaling pathway than the N-cadherin expressing lines PC3 and PC3N. N-cadherin intercellular adhesion mediates a 3.5-fold increase in Bcl-2 protein expression, whereas the level of the proapoptotic protein Bax remains constant. Only N-cadherin ligation in PC3 cells, which express both N-cadherin and E-cadherin, is sufficient to induce activation of Akt/protein kinase B. N-cadherin homophilic ligation initiates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent activation of Akt resulting in Akt phosphorylation of Bad on serine 136. Following N-cadherin homophilic adhesion phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was identified in immunoprecipitates of the N-cadherin.catenin complex. The recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the adhesion complex is dependent on ligation of N-cadherin and an organized actin cytoskeleton because cytochalasin D blocks the recruitment. We propose that N-cadherin homophilic adhesion can initiate anti-apoptotic signaling, which enhances the Akt cell survival pathway in metastatic cancer.',\n",

Monocyte infiltration is implicated, but its mechanisms are unclear given that HSV normally expresses the ICAM-1 but not the VCAM-1 adhesion molecule. To define the mechanisms underlying monocyte adhesion, samples of HSV taken from coronary artery bypass graft patients were co-cultured with human monocytes and adherent monocytes were quantified by immunocytochemistry for CD68 on transverse sections. Pre-treatment of veins with anti-ICAM-1 antibodies reduced monocyte adhesion (monocytes/mm of section) from 7.2 +/- 1.5 to 3.1 +/- 0.7 (p < 0.05, n = 6), but the effect of anti-VCAM-1 was not significant (4.1 +/- 0.7). Paradoxically, pre-treatment of monocytes with either anti-beta(2)-integrins, the counter-receptor of ICAM-1, or anti-alpha(4) integrins, the counter-receptor of VCAM-1, significantly reduced adhesion (1.8 +/- 0.6 and 2.4 +/- 0.7, respectively, p < 0.05). These results were clarified by immunocytochemistry, which confirmed that VCAM-1 expression was absent in harvested vein but was induced in the endothelium during co-culture. Consistent with this, when anti-ICAM-1 or anti-VCAM-1 was present throughout co-culture, either of them reduced adhesion (from 4.2 +/- 0.9 to 2.3 +/- 0.5 and 2.2 +/- 0.4, respectively, p < 0.02, n = 8) and there was no further effect of adding both (2.0 +/- 0.5).

We identified two strongly reactive clones that encoded either the full-length EGFR or its ectodomain. A physiologically relevant interaction between decorin and EGFR was confirmed in the yeast two-hybrid system and further validated by experiments using EGF/EGFR interaction and transient cell transfection assays. Using a panel of deletion mutants, decorin binding was mapped to a narrow region of the EGFR within its ligand-binding L2 domain. Moreover, the central leucine-rich repeat 6 of decorin was required for interaction with the EGFR. Site-directed mutagenesis of the EGFR L2 domain showed that a cluster of residues, His(394)-Ile(402), was essential for both decorin and EGF binding. In contrast, K465, previously shown to be cross-linked to epidermal growth factor (EGF), was required for EGF but not for decorin binding. Thus, decorin binds to a discrete region of the EGFR, partially overlapping with but distinct from the EGF-binding domain. These findings could lead to the generation of protein mimetics capable of suppressing EGFR function.',\n",

Male mice mutant for INSL3 exhibit cryptorchidism or defects in testis descent due to abnormal gubernaculum development whereas overexpression of INSL3 induces ovary descent in transgenic females. Because transgenic mice missing the LGR8 gene are also cryptorchid, INSL3 was tested as the ligand for LGR8. Here, we show that treatment with INSL3 stimulated cAMP production in cells expressing recombinant LGR8 but not LGR7. In addition, interactions between INSL3 and LGR8 were demonstrated following ligand receptor cross-linking. Northern blot analysis indicated that the LGR8 transcripts are expressed in gubernaculum whereas treatment of cultured gubernacular cells with INSL3 stimulated cAMP production and thymidine incorporation. The present study identified the ligand for an orphan G protein-coupled receptor based on common phenotypes of ligand and receptor null mice. Demonstration of INSL3 as the ligand for LGR8 facilitates understanding of the mechanism of testis descent and allows studies on the role of INSL3 in gonadal and other physiological processes.',\n",

Siglecs possess a conserved membrane-distal immunoglobulin domain that mediates binding to sialylated glycoproteins or glycolipids. Although the structural basis of sialic acid recognition by Siglecs is quite well understood, the binding properties of the interaction between Siglecs and their native ligands have not been investigated. CD22 binding requires alpha2-6-linked sialic acid, which is mostly carried on N-glycans. One protein that carries such N-glycans is CD45. In this study we used surface plasmon resonance to perform thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of CD22 binding to native CD45. CD22 bound with a low affinity (K(d) 130 microM at 25 degrees C) and very fast kinetics (k(off) >or=18 s(-1), calculated k(on) >or=1.5 x 10(5) M(-1)s(-1)). Van't Hoff analysis revealed that binding was enthalpically driven at physiological temperatures, as is typical of most lectin-carbohydrate interactions. Since there is evidence that CD22 binds preferably to CD45, even though many cell surface proteins carry alpha2-6-linked sialic acid, we compared the affinities of CD22 binding to CD45, to CD4 carrying alpha2-6-linked sialic acid, and to a synthetic alpha2-6-sialoglycoconjugate. The affinities did not differ substantially, suggesting that CD22 binds preferentially to CD45 not because the latter presents higher affinity ligands but because it carries multiple copies of thereof.\",\n",

GPR7 mRNA was mainly detected in the central nervous system and uterus. In situ hybridization showed that the gene encoding the GPR7 ligand was expressed in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of rats. To determine the molecular structure of the endogenous GPR7 ligand, we purified it from bovine hypothalamic tissue extracts on the basis of cAMP production-inhibitory activity to cells expressing GPR7. Through structural analyses, we found that the purified endogenous ligand was a peptide with 29 amino acid residues and that it was uniquely modified with bromine. We subsequently determined that the C-6 position of the indole moiety in the N-terminal Trp was brominated. We believe this is the first report on a neuropeptide modified with bromine and have hence named it neuropeptide B. In in vitro assays, bromination did not influence the binding of neuropeptide B to the receptor.\",\n",

The antigen-binding groove houses four interlinked hydrophobic channels that are occupied by the alkyl chains of the glycolipid plus two detergent molecules.

One of these ligands is fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) that is expressed on neural cells. While it is known that CD56 is a molecular isoform of NCAM expressed on human NK cells and a subset of T cells, it remains poorly characterized, with its ligand unidentified. Therefore, we were prompted to examine if CD56 molecules on NK cells interact with FGFR expressed on T cells. We demonstrate that ligation of FGFR1 beta on J.C2-14 Jurkat T cells by CD56 on fixed NK-92 cells costimulates TCR/CD3-triggered IL-2 production. CD56-binding mAbs inhibited the costimulatory effect of NK-92 cells in 50-75%. Flow cytometric analysis and cell adhesion assays showed that FGFR1 beta/Fc and FGFR2 beta/Fc chimeric proteins bind to NK-92 cells. The binding of FGFR1 beta/Fc protein to CD56 molecules was verified by immunoprecipitation of CD56 with anti-CD56 mAb followed by Western blotting with FGFR1 beta/Fc. These findings suggest that ligation of FGFR1 by CD56 may contribute to the interaction between NK cells and T cells that we have postulated in our previous studies.',\n",

IL-27 is an early product of activated antigen-presenting cells and drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4(+) T cells.

To investigate the potential role of MK in tumor growth, we expressed MK in human SW-13 cells and studied receptor binding, signal transduction, and activity of MK. The MK protein stimulates soft agar colony formation in vitro and tumor growth of SW-13 cells in athymic nude mice, as well as proliferation of human endothelial cells from brain microvasculature and umbilical vein (HUVEC) in the low ng/ml range. MK binds to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), the receptor for PTN, with an apparent K(d) of 170 pm in intact cells, and this receptor binding of MK is competed by PTN with an apparent K(d) of approximately 20 pm. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the extracellular ligand-binding domain of ALK inhibit ALK receptor binding of MK as well as MK-stimulated colony formation of SW-13 cells. Furthermore, MK stimulates ALK phosphorylation in WI-38 human fibroblasts and activates PI3-kinase and MAP kinase signal transduction in WI-38, HUVEC, neuroblastoma (SH SY-5Y) and glioblastoma (U87MG) cells that express the ALK protein. We conclude that MK can act as a growth, survival, and angiogenic factor during tumorigenesis and signals through the ALK receptor.',\n",

Here, we report the identification of the endogenous ligand for both of these receptors. We purified the peptide ligand from porcine hypothalamus using stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing human GPR8 and cloned the cDNA encoding its precursor protein. The cDNA encodes two forms of the peptide ligand with lengths of 23 and 30 amino acid residues as mature peptides. We designated the two ligands neuropeptide W-23 (NPW23) and neuropeptide W-30 (NPW30). The amino acid sequence of NPW23 is completely identical to that of the N-terminal 23 residues of NPW30. Synthetic NPW23 and NPW30 activated and bound to both GPR7 and GPR8 at similar effective doses. Intracerebroventricular administration of NPW23 in rats increased food intake and stimulated prolactin release. These findings indicate that neuropeptide W is the endogenous ligand for both GPR7 and GPR8 and acts as a mediator of the central control of feeding and the neuroendocrine system.',\n",

It recognizes several VIP-related peptides and displays a very low affinity for secretin despite >70% homology between VIP and secretin. Conversely, the human secretin receptor has high affinity for secretin but low affinity for VIP. We took advantage of this reversed selectivity to identify a domain of the VPAC1 receptor responsible for selectivity toward secretin by constructing human VPAC1-secretin receptor chimeras. A first set of chimeras consisted of exchanging the entire N-terminal ectodomain or large parts of this domain. They were constructed by overlap PCR, transfected in COS-7 cells, and their ligand selectivity, expressed as the ratio of EC(50) for secretin/EC(50) for VIP (referred to as S/V), in stimulating cAMP production was measured. Two very informative chimeras respectively referred to as S144V and S123V were obtained by replacing the entire ectodomain or only the first 123 amino acids of the VPAC1 receptor by the corresponding sequences of the secretin receptor. Whereas S144V no longer discriminated between VIP and secretin (S/V = 1.2), S123V discriminated between the two peptides (S/V = 300) in the same manner as the wild-type VPAC1 receptor. The motif responsible for discrimination was determined by introducing small blocks or individual amino acids of secretin receptor in the 123-144 sequence of the S123V chimera. The data obtained from 14 new chimeras sustained that two nonadjacent pairs of amino acids, Gln(135) Thr(136) and Gly(140) Ser(141) in the C-terminal end of the N-terminal VPAC1 receptor ectodomain constitute a selective filter that strongly restricts access of secretin to the VPAC1 receptor.',\n",

GDF-9 is a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of ligands known to signal through type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors. In the sequenced human genome, seven type I and six type II receptors have been identified. Based on phylogenetic and sequence analyses, we predicted that GDF-9 likely interacts with known type I and type II receptors. We obtained soluble chimeric proteins with the ectodomains of candidate receptors fused to the Fc portion of immunoglobin and tested their ability to act as functional antagonists. Addition of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPRII) ectodomain was most effective in blocking GDF-9 stimulation of granulosa cell proliferation and GDF-9 suppression of FSH-stimulated progesterone production. In addition, the ectodomains of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IA, bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IB, and activin receptor type IIA were partially effective in blocking GDF-9 action. Furthermore, the BMPRII ectodomain directly interacted with GDF-9 in a coprecipitation study demonstrating the role of the BMPRII ectodomain as a binding protein for GDF-9. To demonstrate the role of BMPRII in GDF-9 signaling in follicular cells, the expression of this protein was blocked in cultured granulosa cells using specific BMPRII antisense oligomers. Inhibition of BMPRII biosynthesis completely prevented the GDF-9 induction of granulosa cell thymidine incorporation. GDF-9 expression is essential for early follicle development, and the presence of the type II and type I receptors in the neonatal rat ovary was verified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These results demonstrate the important role of BMPRII in mediating GDF-9 action in granulosa cells from small antral follicles and indicate that the effects of GDF-9 might be transduced by binding to BMPRII and one or more type I receptors.',\n",

By using a human adrenal cell line (NCI-H295R), we have addressed the role of apoE in binding to SR-BI and in selective CE uptake from lipoproteins to cells. This cell line does not secrete apoE and SR-BI is its major HDL-binding protein. We can now provide evidence that 1) free apoE is a ligand for SR-BI, 2) apoE associated to lipids or in lipoproteins does not modulate binding or CE-selective uptake by the SR-BI pathway, and 3) the direct interaction of free apoE to SR-BI leads to an increase in CE uptake from lipoproteins of both low and high densities. We propose that this direct interaction could modify SR-BI structure in cell membranes and potentiate CE uptake.',\n",

Although there have been a number of mammalian Frizzled members identified, their binding specificities with Wnt and functions in mammalian cells have been poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that rat Frizzled-9 (Rfz9) functions in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in 293T cells. Rfz9 overexpression induces the hyperphosphorylation and relocalization of mouse Dishevelled-1 (Dvl-1) from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane and the accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin. Transfections of Rfz9 with each of several Wnt members show that only Wnt-2 activates Rfz9 in T cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcription. Deletion mutant analysis determines that there is a difference in Rfz9 C-terminal residues required for the modifications of Dvl-1 and those required for the inductions of beta-catenin stabilization and TCF transactivation. Deletion of the Wnt-binding domain does not abolish Rfz9 activity completely, although it causes the inactivation of Wnt-2-dependent TCF transcription. Rfz9 also relocalizes Axin from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in the presence of Dvl-1, suggesting that one of the consequences of Dvl-1 relocalization by Rfz9 is to bring Axin to the cell membrane.',\n",

Binding experiments with Fc-chimeric proteins revealed that TAG-1 interacts with L1, NrCAM, and F3/contactin. The membrane-associated as opposed to the soluble form of TAG-1 behaves differently in these assays. We demonstrate that both the immunoglobulin as well as the fibronectin domains promote neurite outgrowth when used as substrates. Furthermore we investigated the putative role of L1 and NrCAM as the neuronal TAG-1 receptors mediating neurite extension. DRG neurons from L1-deficient mice were found to extend neurites on TAG-1 substrates and blocking NrCAM function did not diminish the TAG-1-dependent neurite outgrowth.

In addition to MMP-2, MCP-3 is efficiently cleaved by membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP, the cellular activator of MMP-2, and by collagenase-1 and collagenase-3 (MMP-1, MMP-13) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3). Specificity was shown by absence of cleavage by matrilysin (MMP-7) and the leukocytic MMPs neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) and gelatinase B (MMP-9). The closely related chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-4 were not cleaved by MMP-2 or MT1-MMP, but were cleaved by MMP-1 and MMP-3 with varying efficiency. MCPs were typically cleaved between residues 4 and 5, but MCP-4 was further processed at Val7-Pro8. Synthetic MCP analogs corresponding to the MMP-cleaved forms bound CC chemokine receptor (CCR)-2 and CCR-3, but lacked chemoattractant activity in pre-B cells transfected with CCR-2 and CCR-3 or in THP-1 monocytic cells, a transformed leukemic cell line. Moreover, the truncated products of MCP-2 and MCP-4, like MCP-3, were potent antagonists of their cognate CC chemokine receptors in transwell cell migration assays in vitro. When they were injected 24 hours after the initiation of carrageenan-induced inflammation in rat paws, their in vivo antagonist activities were revealed by a greater than 66% reduction in inflammatory edema progression after 12 hours.

There is no clear sequence similarity between beta-defensins and the chemokine MIP-3alpha, beyond an abundance of cationic residues and the presence of disulfide bonds.

Binding of and inhibition by MAG are lost if neuronal GPI-linked proteins are cleaved. Binding of MAG to NgR-expressing cells is GPI dependent and sialic acid independent. Conversely, NgR binds to MAG-expressing cells.

In this study, we examine the mechanism of endocytosis of IFNGR-1 and the relationship of its nuclear translocation to that of STAT1alpha. In untreated WISH cells, both IFNGR-1 and IFNGR-2 were constitutively localized within caveolae-like microdomains isolated from plasma membrane. However, treatment of cells with IFN-gamma resulted in rapid migration of IFNGR-1, but not IFNGR-2, from these microdomains. Filipin pretreatment, which specifically inhibits endocytosis from caveolae-like microdomains, inhibited the nuclear translocation of IFN-gamma and IFNGR-1 as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1alpha, but did not affect the binding of IFN-gamma to these cells. In the Jurkat T lymphocyte cell line, which does not express caveolin-1, nuclear translocation of IFNGR-1 and STAT1alpha were similarly inhibited by filipin pretreatment. Isolation of lipid microdomains from Jurkat cells showed that both IFNGR-1 and IFNGR-2 were associated with lipid microdomains only after stimulation with IFN-gamma, suggesting that the IFNGR subunits are recruited to lipid microdomains by IFN-gamma binding in lymphocytes (Jurkat) in contrast to their constitutive presence in epithelial (WISH) cells. In contrast, treatments that block clathrin-dependent endocytosis did not inhibit either activation or nuclear translocation of STAT1alpha or the nuclear translocation of IFN-gamma or IFNGR-1.

Two children were found to be heterozygous for a missense mutation, R236G, which disrupts the dibasic cleavage site between beta melanocyte-stimulating hormone (beta-MSH) and beta-endorphin. Beta-TC3 cells transfected with the mutant POMC cDNA produced a mutant beta-MSH/beta-endorphin fusion protein. This fusion protein bound to the human melanocortin-4 receptor (hMC4R) with an affinity similar to its natural ligands, but had a markedly reduced ability to activate the receptor. This variant co-segregated with early-onset obesity over three generations in one family and was absent in 412 normal weight UK Caucasian controls. Combining the results in UK Caucasians with a new case-control study in French subjects and three previously published reports, mutations disrupting this processing site were present in 0.88% of subjects with early-onset obesity and 0.22% of normal-weight controls. These results suggest that the R236G mutation may confer an inherited susceptibility to obesity through the production of an aberrant fusion protein that has the capacity to interfere with central melanocortin signalling.',\n",

In the adult brain, Reelin is expressed by GABA-ergic interneurons, suggesting a potential function as a modulator of neurotransmission. ApoE receptors have been indirectly implicated in memory and neurodegenerative disorders because their ligand, apoE, is genetically associated with Alzheimer disease. We have used knockout mice to investigate the role of Reelin and its receptors in cognition and synaptic plasticity. Mice lacking either the VLDL receptor or the apoER2 show contextual fear conditioning deficits. VLDL receptor-deficient mice also have a moderate defect in long term potentiation (LTP), and apoER2 knockouts have a pronounced one. The perfusion of mouse hippocampal slices with Reelin has no effect on baseline synaptic transmission but significantly enhances LTP in area CA1. This Reelin-dependent augmentation of LTP is abolished in VLDL receptor and apoER2 knockout mice. Our results reveal a role for Reelin in controlling synaptic plasticity in the adult brain and suggest that both of its receptors are necessary for Reelin-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Thus, the impairment of apoE receptor-dependent neuromodulation may contribute to cognitive impairment and synaptic loss in Alzheimer disease.',\n",

For example, neither Ni(2+) nor the receptor-associated protein, which blocks binding of all known ligands to LRP, block alpha(2)M*-induced signal transduction. In the current study, we employed alpha(2)-macroglobulin (alpha(2)M)-agarose column chromatography to purify cell surface membrane binding proteins from 1-LN human prostate cancer cells and murine macrophages. The predominant binding protein purified from 1-LN prostate cancer cells was Grp 78 with small amounts of LRP, a fact that is consistent with our previous observations that there is little LRP present on the surface of these cells. The ratio of LRP:Grp 78 is much higher in macrophages. Flow cytometry was employed to demonstrate the presence of Grp 78 on the cell surface of 1-LN cells. Purified Grp 78 binds to alpha(2)M* with high affinity (K(d) approximately 150 pm). A monoclonal antibody directed against Grp 78 both abolished alpha(2)M*-induced signal transduction and co-precipitated LRP. Ligand blotting with alpha(2)M* showed binding to both Grp 78 and LRP heavy chains in these preparations. Use of RNA interference to silence LRP expression had no effect on alpha(2)M*-mediated signaling. We conclude that Grp 78 is essential for alpha(2)M*-induced signal transduction and that a \"co-receptor\" relationship exists with LRP like that seen with several other ligands and receptors such as the uPA/uPAR (urinary type plasminogen activator or urokinase/uPA receptor) system.',\n",

In particular, these studies suggest that the PLP protein may be involved in signaling through integrins in oligodendrocytes. Stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on oligodendrocytes induced formation of a tripartite complex containing PLP, calreticulin, and alpha(v)-integrin. PLP interacted directly with the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha(v)-integrin. Complex formation was mediated by phospholipase C and Ca2+ binding to the high affinity binding site on calreticulin.

With the help of two monoclonal antibodies, Gi11 and Gi13, against a 43-kD surface glycoprotein on human platelets, a full-length cDNA encoding JAM-3 was identified. JAM-3 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein containing two Ig-like domains. Although JAM-3 did not undergo homophilic interactions, myelo-monocytic cells adhered to immobilized JAM-3 or to JAM-3-transfected cells.

Treatment of brain-tissue slices with aTf produced a marked increase in the expression of MBP, CNPase, and tubulin mRNAs. Colchicine, cytochalasin, and taxol severely reduced the effect of aTf. Addition to cultures of an antibody against transferrin receptor (TfR), protein kinase inhibitors, or a cyclic AMP (cAMP) analogue showed that a functionally intact TfR was necessary, and that tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C and A, as well as calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase (Ca-CaMK) activities appeared to mediate aTf actions upon the expression of the above mentioned genes. Changes in the levels of phosphoinositides and cAMP induced by aTf in oligodendroglial cell (OLGc) cultures correlated with these results and coincide with an activation of the cyclic response element binding protein (CREB) and of mitogen activated protein kinases.

An extracellular portion of the LRP, known as the cluster II region can bind to the secreted form of APP (sAPP-KPI). We show here that a GST fusion protein containing the cluster II region of LRP can be used as a 'mini-receptor' that specifically binds to sAPP-KPI from conditioned cultured medium. The binding between the GST-LRP-cluster II fusion protein and sAPP-KPI can be inhibited with the strong binding ligand of LRP1, called receptor-associated protein (RAP). Furthermore, a cell-based in vitro assay system has been developed to monitor the production of total A beta and A beta(1-42) in the presence and absence of RAP in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines both deficient in LRP and expressing LRP. A 3-day treatment of the L2 (CHO cells deficient in LRP and overexpressing APP751) and L3 (CHO cells expressing LRP and overexpressing APP751) cell lines with RAP showed a decrease in total A beta and, interestingly, also a decrease in the ratio of A beta42/A beta(total). This cell-based model system and LRP-cluster II mini-receptor will be very useful for screening novel compounds that can reduce A beta accumulation by inhibiting binding of APP-KPI to LRP1.\",\n",

Testing of MC2R activity is difficult because most cells express endogenous MCRs; hence, ACTH will elicit background activation of assayable reporter systems. Inactivating mutations of MC2R lead to hereditary unresponsiveness to ACTH, also known as familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD). These patients are usually seen in early childhood with very low cortisol concentrations, normal mineralocorticoids, hyperpigmentation, and increased bodily growth. Several MC2R mutations have been reported in FGD, but assays of the activities of these mutants are cumbersome. We saw two patients with typical clinical findings of FGD. Genetic analysis showed that patient 1 was homozygous for the mutation R137W, and patient 2 was a compound heterozygote for S74I and Y254C. We tested the activity of these mutations in OS-3 cells, which are unresponsive to ACTH but have intact downstream cAMP signal transduction. OS-3 cells transfected with a cAMP-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid (pCREluc) were unresponsive to ACTH, but cotransfection with a vector expressing human MC2R increased luciferase activity more than 40-fold. Addition of ACTH to cells cotransfected with the pCREluc reporter and wild-type MC2R activated luciferase expression with a 50% effective concentration of 5.5 x 10(-9) M ACTH, which is similar to previously reported values. By contrast, the MC2R mutant R137W had low activity, and the S74I or Y254C mutants elicited no measurable response. This assay provides excellent sensitivity in an easily assayed transient transfection system, providing a more rapid and efficient measurement of ACTH receptor activity.',\n",

A final stage of development, termed maturation, yields DCs that are strong stimulators of T cell-mediated immunity and is associated with a remodeling of the cell surface that includes a change in the levels of expression of many molecules, including chemokine receptors. We show in this study that CCR3, a chemokine receptor initially discovered on eosinophils, is also expressed by human DCs that differentiate from blood monocytes, DCs that emigrate from skin (epidermal and dermal DCs), and DCs derived from CD34+ hemopoietic precursors in bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, and cytokine-elicited peripheral blood leukapheresis. Unlike other chemokine receptors, such as CCR5 and CCR7, the expression of CCR3 is not dependent on the state of maturation. All DC subsets contain a large intracellular pool of CCR3. The surface expression of CCR3 is not modulated following uptake of particulate substances such as zymosan or latex beads. CCR3 mediates in vitro chemotactic responses to the known ligands, eotaxin and eotaxin-2, because the DC response to these chemokines is inhibited by CCR3-specific mAbs. We postulate that expression of CCR3 may underlie situations where both DCs and eosinophils accumulate in vivo, such as the lesions of patients with Langerhans cell granulomatosis.',\n",

Receptor activator of NFkB ligand (RANKL) is one of the key regulatory molecules in OC formation. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a novel secreted member of the TNF receptor superfamily that negatively regulates osteoclastogenesis and binds to RANKL. We examined the biological actions of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), RANKL, and OPG on the differentiation of OCs isolated from cocultures of mouse osteoblastic cells and bone marrow cells. Preosteoclasts (pOCs) and OCs were characterized by their ultrastructure and the expression of OC markers such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase. pOCs formed without any additives expressed TRAP, but showed little resorptive activity on cocultured dentine slices. TRAP-positive pOCs treated with M-CSF began to fuse with each other, but lacked a ruffled border (RB) and showed almost no resorptive activity. pOCs treated with RANKL became TRAP-positive multinucleated cells, which expressed intense vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase along the RB membranes and exhibited prominent resorptive activity. Such effects of RANKL on pOCs were completely inhibited by the addition of OPG. OPG inhibited RB formation in mature OCs and reduced their resorptive activity, and also induced apoptosis of some OCs. These results suggest that 1) RANKL induces differentiation of functional OCs from pOCs, 2) M-CSF induces macrophage-like multinucleated cells, but not OCs, 3) OPG inhibits RB formation and resorptive activity in mature OCs, 4) OPG also induces apoptosis of OCs, and 5) RANKL and OPG are, therefore, important regulators of not only the terminal differentiation of OCs but also their resorptive function.',\n",

Grb7 is an adaptor molecule implicated in the regulation of cell migration. Here we report identification of an interaction between Grb7 and the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 by using Grb7 as a \"bait\" in a yeast two-hybrid screening. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to confirm the interaction of Grb7 with the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 as well as the full-length receptor in intact cells. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of Grb7 and requires tyrosine autophosphorylation of EphB1. Furthermore, Tyr-928 of EphB1 was identified as the primary binding site for Grb7. Stimulation of endogenous EphB1 in embryonal carcinoma P19 cells with its ligand ephrinB1 increased its association with Grb7, which is consistent with a role for the autophosphorylation of EphB1. We also found that EphB1 could phosphorylate Grb7 and mutation of either Tyr-928 or Tyr-594 to Phe decreased this activity. Finally, we show that EphB1 could stimulate fibroblast motility on extracellular matrix in a kinase-dependent manner, which also correlated with its association with Grb7. Consistent with this, co-expression of Grb7 with EphB1 further enhanced cell motility, whereas co-expression of the Grb7 SH2 domain abolished EphB1-stimulated cell migration. Together, our results identified a novel interaction between EphB1 with the adaptor molecule Grb7 and suggested that this interaction may play a role in the regulation of cell migration by EphB1.',\n",

Both form heterodimeric RAMP/receptor complexes at the cell surface. This association represents a novel principle of G protein-coupled receptor function. RAMP1 is transported to the cell surface together with the CRLR or the CT receptor. Here, we have investigated the functional relevance of the short C-terminal intracellular tail QSKRTEGIV and of the single transmembrane domain of human (h) RAMP1 for their interactions with the hCRLR to constitute a CGRP receptor. To this end, hRAMP1 has been sequentially truncated from the C-terminus, and [(125)I]h alpha CGRP/hRAMP1/hCRLR association at the cell surface and cAMP accumulation in response to h alpha CGRP have been examined. With the C-terminal truncation of hRAMP1 by four amino acids wild-type hRAMP1 function was maintained, and the hCRLR was required for the transport of hRAMP1 to the cell surface. Further truncation of hRAMP1 through removal of the remaining five intracellular amino acids revealed CRLR-independent cell surface delivery but otherwise normal hRAMP1 activity. Sequential shortening of the hRAMP1 transmembrane domain resulted in progressively impaired association with the hCRLR and, as a consequence, abolished CGRP receptor function. In conclusion, the intracellular QSKRT sequence adjacent to the transmembrane domain of hRAMP1 provides a signal for intracellular retention. The sequence is unrelated to consensus endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval motives and overridden by the presence of the hCRLR. The entire single transmembrane domain of hRAMP1 together with one hydrophilic amino acid residue at its C-terminus is required for the formation of a fully functional CGRP/hRAMP1/hCRLR receptor complex.',\n",

Here we investigated the binding of Lu to laminin alpha5 in vivo and in vitro. We prepared a soluble recombinant Lu (sol-Lu) composed of the Lu extracellular domain and a His(6) tag. Sol-Lu bound specifically to laminin-10/11 (alpha5beta1/beta2gamma1) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and bound to bona fide basement membranes containing laminin alpha5 in tissue sections. Sol-Lu did not bind to tissue sections of laminin alpha5 knockout embryos, despite the fact that the four other alpha chains were present. To identify the Lu-binding site on laminin alpha5, we prepared modified alpha5 cDNAs encoding chimeric laminins containing all or part of the laminin alpha1 G domain in place of the analogous alpha5 regions. These constructs were used to generate transgenic mice. Proteins derived from transgenes were detected in basement membranes and were assayed for their ability to bind Lu by examining the localization of endogenous Lu and the binding of sol-Lu applied to tissue sections. Our results demonstrate that the alpha5 LG3 module is essential for Lu binding to laminin alpha5.',\n",

By using a subclone of 293F cells with stable expression of XEDAR, we report that XEDAR activates the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. Treatment with EDA-A2 leads to the recruitment of TRAF3 and -6 to the aggregated XEDAR complex, suggesting a central role of these adaptors in the proximal aspect of XEDAR signaling. Whereas TRAF3 and -6, IKK1/IKKalpha, IKK2/IKKbeta, and NEMO/IKKgamma are involved in XEDAR-induced NF-kappaB activation, XEDAR-induced JNK activation seems to be mediated via a pathway dependent on TRAF3, TRAF6, and ASK1. Deletion and point mutagenesis studies delineate two distinct regions in the cytoplasmic domain of XEDAR, which are involved in binding to TRAF3 and -6, respectively, and play a major role in the activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Taken together, our results establish a major role of TRAF3 and -6 in XEDAR signaling and in the process of ectodermal differentiation.',\n",

However, there are increasing data that prove the existence of non-canonical Wnt signaling and demonstrate its involvement in different developmental processes. In vertebrates, Wnt-11 and Wnt-5A can activate the Wnt/JNK pathway, which resembles the planar cell polarity pathway in Drosophila. The Wnt/Ca(2+)-pathway has only been described in Xenopus and zebrafish so far and it is unclear whether it also exists in other organisms.

Within this subfamily, IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 exhibit substantial sharing of receptor complexes; all three are capable of signaling through IL-20RA/IL-20RB, and IL-20 and IL-24 both can also use IL-22R/IL-20RB. However, the biological effects of these three cytokines appear quite distinct: immune activity with IL-19, skin biology with IL-20, and tumor apoptosis with IL-24. To more fully elucidate their interactions with the receptor complexes, we have performed a series of in vitro assays. Reporter, proliferation, and direct STAT activation assays using cell lines expressing transfected receptors revealed differences between the receptor complexes. IL-19 and IL-24 also exhibited growth inhibition on a cell line endogenously expressing all three receptor subunits, an effect that was seen at cytokine levels two orders of magnitude above those required for STAT activation or proliferation.

From the distance dependence of the protein-protein interaction potential, we demonstrate directly that the full-length extracellular domains adhere in a head-to-head orientation. The absence of long-range electrostatic protein-protein attraction further indicates that the salt bridges between the binding surfaces only influence the interaction at short range. Despite the loss of a stabilizing disulfide bond in domain 1 (D1) of CD2, adhesive failure occurs abruptly with no evidence of partial protein unfolding during detachment. Finally, these measurements between extended membrane surfaces directly confirm that the low-affinity CD2-CD48 bond generates weak adhesion and that lateral receptor mobility is required for the development of appreciable adhesion. This is the first direct measurement of the range and magnitude of the forces governing heterotypic adhesion mediated by cell surface proteins.

Previously it has been suggested that the remaining alpha(v) integrin, alpha(v)beta(3,) does not interact with LAPbeta(1). However, here we show clearly that alpha(v)beta(3) does indeed interact with the LAPbeta(1) RGD motif. This interaction is similar to other alpha(v)beta(3) ligands in terms of the cations required for adhesion, the concentrations of LAPbeta(1) required for binding and the ability of a small-molecule inhibitor of alpha(v)beta(3), SB223245, to block the interaction. Using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins we have mapped a minimal integrin-binding loop in LAPbeta(1) and then used this approach to probe the integrin-binding properties of the equivalent loops in LAPbeta(2) and LAPbeta(3).

The precision of this cleavage is affected by familial Alzheimer's disease-associated PS1 mutations similar to the pathological endoproteolysis of betaAPP.

It has been an enigma whether the hormone interacts with the endodomain. In a step to address the question, exoloop 3 of (580)KVPLITVSKAK(590) was examined by Ala scan, multiple substitution, assays for hormone binding, cAMP and inositol phosphate (IP) induction, and photoaffinity labeling. We present the evidence for the interaction of FSH and exoloop 3. A peptide mimic of exoloop 3 specifically and saturably photoaffinity-labels FSH alpha but not FSH beta. This is in contrast to photoaffinity labeling of FSH beta by the peptide mimic of the N-terminal region of the receptor. Leu(583) and Ile(584) are crucial for the interaction of FSH and exoloop 3. Substitutions of these two residues enhanced the hormone binding affinity. This is due to the loss of the original side chains but not the introduction of new side chains. The Leu(583) and Ile(584) side chains appear to project in opposite directions. Ile(584) appears to be so specific and to require flexibility and stereo specificity so that no other amino acids can fit into its place. Leu(583) is less specific. The improvement in hormone binding by substitutions was offset by the severe impairment of signal generation of cAMP and/or inositol phosphate. For example, the Phe or Tyr substitution of Leu(583) improved the hormone binding and cAMP induction but impaired IP induction. On the other hand, the substitutions for Ile(584) and Lys(590) abolished the cAMP and IP induction.

An important mediator in this setting is the phosphoprotein osteopontin, whose secretion by activated T cells confers resistance to infection by several intracellular pathogens through recruitment and activation of macrophages. Here, we analyze the structural basis of this activity following cleavage of the phosphoprotein by thrombin into two fragments. An interaction between the C-terminal domain of osteopontin and the receptor CD44 induces macrophage chemotaxis, and engagement of beta(3)-integrin receptors by a nonoverlapping N-terminal osteopontin domain induces cell spreading and subsequent activation. Serine phosphorylation of the osteopontin molecule on specific sites is required for functional interaction with integrin but not CD44 receptors. Thus, in addition to regulation of intracellular enzymes and substrates, phosphorylation also regulates the biological activity of secreted cytokines. These data, taken as a whole, indicate that the activities of distinct osteopontin domains are required to coordinate macrophage migration and activation and may bear on incompletely understood mechanisms of delayed-type hypersensitivity, wound healing, and granulomatous disease.',\n",

In contrast, OR 17-210 exhibited specific saturable binding (K(d) = 9.48 nM) corresponding to the presence of a single class of high-affinity binding sites (B(max) = 65.8 fmol/mg prot). Association and dissociation kinetics further confirmed high-affinity interaction between pOBP and OR 17-210. Autoradiographic studies of labeled pOBP to newborn mouse slices revealed the presence of multiple specific binding sites located mainly in olfactory tissue but also in several other peripheral tissues. Our data thus demonstrate a high-affinity interaction between OBP and OR, indicating that under physiological conditions, ORs may be specifically associated with an OBP partner in the absence of odorant. This provides further evidence of a novel role for OBP in the mechanism of olfactory perception.',\n",
       " '12381680': 'C-C chemokine receptor-1 (CCR1) has been implicated in mediating a variety of inflammatory conditions including multiple sclerosis and organ rejection. Although originally referred to as the MIP-1alpha/RANTES receptor, CCR1 is quite promiscuous and can be activated by numerous chemokines. We used radioligand binding and [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays in membranes from a cell line transfected to express CCR1 (Ba/F3-hCCR1) to characterize a panel of chemokines (HCC-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MIP-1delta, MPIF-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and RANTES) as CCR1 ligands. In this recombinant model, these chemokines displaced 125I-MIP-1alpha with a wide range of potencies and, with the exception of MCP-2, acted as full agonists in stimulating [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange. We then assessed the utility of HL-60 cells cultured with known differentiating agents (PMA, DMSO, dibutyryl-cAMP or retinoic acid) for investigating CCR1 pharmacology. In [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, membranes from cells cultured with retinoic acid (4-6 days) were the most responsive to activation by MIP-1alpha and MPIF-1. FACS analysis and comparative pharmacology confirmed that these activities were mediated by CCR1. Using [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, intracellular calcium flux and/or whole cell chemotaxis assays in HL-60(Rx) cells, we validated that MIP-1alpha was the most potent CCR1 ligand (MIP-1alpha>MPIF-1>RANTES>or=MIP-1beta) although the ligands differed in their efficacy as agonists. MPIF-1 was the more efficacious (MPIF-1>RANTES=MIP-1alpha>>MIP-1beta). 125I-MIP-1beta binding in Ba/F3-hCCR1 and HL-60(Rx) membranes was competitively displaced by MIP-1alpha, MPIF-1 and MIP-1beta. The binding K(i) for these chemokines with 125I-MIP-1beta were essentially identical in the two membrane systems. Lastly, MIP-1beta antagonized [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange, Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis in HL-60(Rx) cells in response to robust agonists such as MIP-1alpha, RANTES and MPIF-1. Based on our results, we propose that MIP-1beta could function as an endogenous inhibitor of CCR1 function.',\n",

In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that EphA4, a receptor of ephrin-B3, was expressed in the lateral thalamus (visual and somaotosensory thalamus) of the developing rat brain, but not in the medial thalamic nuclei which project to the limbic cortex. Correspondingly, ephrin-B3 was expressed strongly in the developing limbic cortex including amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. To examine the action of ephrin-B3 on thalamic axons, either lateral or medial thalamic explants were cultured on membranes obtained from ephrin-B3-expressing COS cells. Axonal growth was inhibited for cells from the lateral thalamus but not from the medial thalamus. These results suggest that ephrin-B3 contributes to regional specificity by suppressing axonal growth of lateral thalamic neurons.',\n",

It has by now been clearly established that the maturation of the glycoproteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum involves interactions with molecular chaperones, which promote the folding and assembly of the glycoproteins. In this study, we investigated whether calnexin (CNX), calreticulin (CRT) and BiP, three of the main molecular chaperones present in the endoplasmic reticulum, interact with the TSHR and what effects these interactions might have on the folding of the receptor. In the first set of experiments, we observed that in a K562 cell line expressing TSHR, about 50% of the receptor synthesized was degraded by the proteasome after ubiquitination. In order to determine whether TSHR interact with CNX, CRT and BiP, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. TSHR was found to be associated with all three molecular chaperones. To study the role of the interactions between CNX and CRT and the TSHR, we used castanospermine, a glucosidase I and II inhibitor that blocks the interactions between these chaperones and glycoproteins. In K562 cells expressing the TSHR, these drugs led to a faster degradation of the receptor, which indicates that these interactions contribute to stabilizing the receptor after its synthesis. The overexpression of calnexin and calreticulin in these cells stabilizes the receptor during the first hour after its synthesis, whereas the degradation of TSHR increased in a cell line overexpressing BiP and the quantity of TSHR able to acquire complex type oligosaccharides decreased. These results show that calnexin, calreticulin and BiP all interact with TSHR and that the choice made between these two chaperone systems is crucial because each of them has distinct effects on the folding and stability of this receptor at the endoplasmic reticulum level.',\n",

The best characterised function of E-cadherin is homotypic, calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion; however, the observation that E-cadherin is also capable of interacting with the alphaEbeta7 integrin to mediate leukocyte cell-cell adhesion [Nature 372 (1994) 190] suggests that it also participates in heterotypic interactions. To investigate the possibility that E-cadherin may interact with integrins expressed on non-leukocytic cells, cell adhesion and solid-phase receptor-ligand binding experiments were performed using a pentameric E-cadherin construct designed to detect low affinity, high avidity interactions. HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells specifically adhered to pentameric E-cadherin, and this adhesion was inhibited by anti-functional monoclonal antibodies directed against the integrin alpha2 and beta1 subunits, but not by a series of antibodies recognising other subunits. This suggested that the E-cadherin receptor was alpha2beta1, a previously characterised collagen/laminin receptor. Pentameric E-cadherin, but not monomeric E-cadherin, specifically bound, in a divalent cation-dependent manner, to both purified alpha2beta1 and to a recombinant form of the A-domain of the alpha2 subunit, which has been shown to be a major ligand-binding site within this and other integrins. These findings demonstrate that E-cadherin can interact with alpha2beta1 and suggest that heterotypic interactions between E-cadherin and integrins may be more common than originally thought.',\n",

Two peptides, L8 and L8C, derived from a larger precursor, were recently described as natural ligands for GPR8 (Mori, M., Shimomura, Y., Harada, M., Kurihara, M., Kitada, C., Asami, T., Matsumoto, Y., Adachi, Y., Watanabe, T., Sugo, T., and Abe, M. (December, 27, 2001) World Patent Cooperation Treaty, Patent Application WO 01/98494A1). L8 is a 23-amino acid peptide, whereas L8C is the same peptide with a C terminus extension of 7 amino acids, running through a dibasic motif of proteolytic processing. Using as a query the amino acid sequence of the L8 peptide, we have identified in DNA databases a human gene predicted to encode related peptides and its mouse ortholog. By analogy with L8 and L8C, two peptides, named L7 and L7C could result from the processing of a 125-amino acid human precursor through the alternative usage of a dibasic amino acid motif. The activity of these four peptides was investigated on GPR7 and GPR8. In binding assays, L7, L7C, L8, and L8C were found to bind with low nanomolar affinities to the GPR7 and GPR8 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells. They inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation through a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. The tissue distribution of prepro-L7 (ppL7) and prepro-L8 (ppL8) was investigated by reverse transcription-PCR. Abundant ppL7 transcripts were found throughout the brain as well as in spinal cord, spleen, testis, and placenta; ppL8 transcripts displayed a more restricted distribution in brain, with high levels in substantia nigra, but were more abundant in peripheral tissues. The ppL7 and ppL8 genes therefore encode the precursors of a class of peptide ligands, active on two receptor subtypes, GPR7 and GPR8. The distinct tissue distribution of the receptor and peptide precursors suggest that each ligand and receptor has partially overlapping but also specific roles in this signaling system.',\n",

The protein was found to be localized, at least in part, on the plasma membrane, probably in the form of a trimer. The results indicated that GIP is a transmembrane protein and the most part of the molecule is intracellular. Sequence homology inferred that GIP cytosolic domain is folded as a collagen-like helix followed by a globular domain. The interaction of the globular domain with the V2R was confirmed by pull-down experiments indicating that this structural motif can also interact with cytosolic proteins.',\n",

Recent studies have demonstrated that a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family protein, Gdf11 (growth and differentiation factor 11), and the activin type II receptor, ActRIIB, are involved in controlling the spatiotemporal expression of multiple Hox genes along the AP axis, and that the disruption of each of these genes causes anterior transformation of the vertebrae. Skeletal defects are more severe in Gdf11-null mice than in ActRIIB-null mice, however, leaving it uncertain whether Gdf11 signals via ActRIIB. Here we demonstrate using genetic and biochemical studies that ActRIIB and its subfamily receptor, ActRIIA, cooperatively mediate the Gdf11 signal in patterning the axial vertebrae, and that Gdf11 binds to both ActRIIA and ActRIIB, and induces phosphorylation of Smad2. In addition, we also show that these two receptors can functionally compensate for one another to mediate signaling of another TGF-beta ligand, nodal, during left-right patterning and the development of anterior head structure.',\n",
       " '12415008': 'The development of fibrosis is a common response to a variety of injuries and results in the net accumulation of matrix proteins and impairment of normal organ function. We previously reported that the integrin alpha8beta1 is expressed by alveolar interstitial cells in normal lung and is upregulated during the development of fibrosis. TGFbeta1 is an important mediator of the inflammatory response in pulmonary fibrosis. TGFbeta1 is secreted as a latent protein that is non-covalently associated with latency-associated peptide (LAP) and requires activation to exert its effects. LAP-TGFbeta1 and LAP-TGFbeta3 contain the tripeptide sequence, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD), a known integrin recognition motif. The integrin alpha8beta1 binds to several ligands such as fibronectin and vitronectin through the RGD sequence. Recent reports demonstrate that the integrins alphavbeta1, alphavbeta6 and alphavbeta8 adhere to LAP-TGFbeta1 through the RGD site. Therefore, we asked whether LAP-TGFbeta1 might be a ligand for alpha8beta1 and whether this may be important in the development of fibrosis. We found that cell lines transfected with alpha8 subunit were able to spread on and adhere to recombinant LAP-TGFbeta1 significantly better than mock transfected cell lines. alpha8-transfected cells were also able to adhere to LAP-TGFbeta3 significantly better than mock transfected cells. Adhesion to LAP-TGFbeta1 was enhanced by activation of alpha8beta1 by Mn(2+), or 8A2, an integrin beta1 activating antibody. Furthermore, cell adhesion was abolished when we used a recombinant LAP-TGFbeta1 protein in which the RGD site was mutated to RGE. alpha8beta1 binding to LAP-TGFbeta1 increased cell proliferation and phosphorylation of FAK and ERK, but did not activate of TGFbeta1. These data strongly suggest that LAP-TGFbeta1 is a ligand of alpha8beta1 and interaction of alpha8beta1 with LAP-TGFbeta1 may influence cell behavior.',\n",

CD97 binds to its cellular ligand CD55 (decay accelerating factor), which protects several cell types from complement-mediated damage. The functional consequences of CD97-CD55 binding are largely unknown, but previous data imply that CD97-CD55 interactions play a role in cellular activation, migration, and adhesion under inflammatory conditions. Here we examined the expression of CD97 and CD55 by immunohistochemistry in multiple sclerosis (MS). On the basis of established criteria for inflammation and demyelination, different lesion stages were distinguished in MS post-mortem brain tissue. In normal white matter, CD97 expression was not found, but CD55 was expressed with weak staining intensity on endothelial cells. In pre-active lesions, defined by abnormalities of the white matter, many infiltrating T cells, macrophages (MPhi) and microglia expressed CD97. CD55 was highly expressed by endothelial cells. In active lesions with myelin degradation, MPhi and microglia expressed both CD55 and CD97. Furthermore, a sandwich ELISA showed significantly (p<0.05) elevated levels of soluble CD97 in serum but not in cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients (37%) compared to healthy controls (8%).Collectively, these data suggest that CD97-CD55 interactions are involved in the inflammatory processes in MS. CD55, which is expressed in lesions by vessels to protect against complement-mediated damage, might bind to CD97 on infiltrating leukocytes. This interaction may facilitate cell activation and migration through the blood-brain barrier. In addition, CD97-CD55 interactions in the parenchyma of the brain may contribute to the inflammation.',\n",

We have previously demonstrated that BMP-15 regulates granulosa cell (GC) proliferation and differentiation; namely, BMP-15 promotes GC mitosis, suppresses follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor expression, and stimulates kit ligand expression. Although the role of BMP-15 in female reproduction has progressively deserved much attention, there is nothing known to date about the signaling pathway and receptors for BMP-15. Using rat primary GCs and a human GC cell line, COV434, we have now found that administration of BMP-15 causes a rapid and transient phosphorylation, thus activation, of the Smad1/5/8 pathway. BMP-15 also stimulated promoter activity of a selective BMP-responsive reporter construct, further demonstrating the stimulation of Smad1/5/8 signaling by BMP-15. In contrast, BMP-15 stimulation of Smad2 phosphorylation was very weak. To identify the receptors for BMP-15, we utilized recombinant extracellular domains of individual transforming growth factor-beta superfamily receptors and found that activin receptor-like kinase-6 extracellular domain most effectively co-immunoprecipitates with BMP-15, whereas BMP receptor type II extracellular domain was most effective in inhibiting BMP-15 bioactivity on FSH-induced progesterone production and GC thymidine incorporation. We also investigated whether activation of the MAPK pathway is necessary for BMP-15 biological activity and found that the addition of U0126, an inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suppresses BMP-15 activity on GC mitotsis but not on FSH-induced progesterone production, suggesting a selective signaling cascade in GC proliferation and differentiation.',\n",

Saturation binding and displacement experiments showed that [(125)I]YVP and [(125)I]EYF bound selectively with a very high affinity, K(D)=0.18 nM and 0.06 nM, to NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptors respectively. By using in vitro autoradiography with these radioligands and frog pancreatic polypeptide (PP) as selective unlabelled competitor of NPFF(2) binding sites, NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptor distribution was analyzed throughout the rat CNS. The highest densities of [(125)I]EYF binding sites were seen in the most external layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the parafascicular thalamic nucleus, laterodorsal thalamic nucleus and presubiculum of hippocampus. All specific binding of this radioligand was inhibited by 200 nM frog PP. The density of 0.1 nM [(125)I]YVP binding was much smaller in all brain areas and frog PP-insensitive binding sites (NPFF(1) receptor subtype) were detected in septal, thalamic and hypothalamic areas but were absent in the spinal cord. The restricted distribution of NPFF(1) receptors in the CNS supports its specific role in a limited number of neuronal functions.

       " '12427015': \"MIP-1beta is a CC-chemokine that plays a role in inflammation and host defense mechanisms by interacting with its specific receptor CCR5. CCR5 is a major coreceptor for macrophage-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and as a consequence, MIP-1beta can inhibit HIV entry. It is therefore of interest to understand how MIP-1beta and other CCR5 ligands bind to their receptor, as such understanding could lead to the rational design of more efficient HIV entry blockers. We have previously demonstrated the importance of Phe13, and of basic residues of the 40's loop, in mediating high-affinity binding of MIP-1beta to CCR5. We have now investigated further the relative contribution of other MIP-1beta residues in the interaction of the chemokine with CCR5, by studying the functional consequences of point mutations within the N-loop and the 3(10) turn of MIP-1beta, affecting the charge, size, and H-bonding properties of the side chains. Our data suggest that, in addition to Phe13, three amino acids of the N-loop and 3(10) turn (Arg18, Lys19, and Arg22) interact with CCR5 through their positive charge. We also found that Pro21 contributes to the CCR5 binding properties of MIP-1beta. Moreover, NMR spectroscopy has revealed that the presence of Tyr at position 15 is necessary for the proper folding of the chemokine. Our results therefore demonstrate that the binding determinants of MIP-1beta consist of residues arranged on one surface of the protein, including most of the basic residues in MIP-1beta, as well as two key hydrophobic groups. The good correlation observed between the potency of the mutants in a functional assay and their binding affinity strongly argues that basic residues Arg18, Lys19, and Arg22 of MIP-1beta are essential for its CCR5 binding properties, without a primary effect on CCR5 activation.\",\n",

To understand the molecular interactions of the angiopoietins with their receptor, we have studied the binding of Ang-1 and Ang-2 to the Tie-2 receptor. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based competition assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments analyzing the binding of Ang-1 and Ang-2 to truncation mutants of the extracellular domain of Tie-2 showed that the first Ig-like loop of Tie-2 in combination with the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (amino acids 1-360) is required for angiopoietin binding. The first Ig-like domain or the EGF-like repeats alone are not capable of binding Ang-1 and Ang-2. Concomitantly, we made the surprising finding that Tie-2 exon-2 knockout mice do express a mutated Tie-2 protein that lacks 104 amino acids of the first Ig-like domain. This mutant Tie-2 receptor is functionally inactive as shown by the lack of ligand binding and receptor phosphorylation. Collectively, the data show that the first 104 amino acids of the Tie-2 receptor are essential but not sufficient for angiopoietin binding. Conversely, the first 360 amino acids (Ig-like domain plus EGF-like repeats) of the Tie-2 receptor are necessary and sufficient to bind both Ang-1 and Ang-2, which suggests that differential receptor binding is not likely to be responsible for the different functions of Ang-1 and Ang-2.',\n",

The aim of the present study was to identify PACAP receptor isoforms and to determine whether PACAP can affect intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and catecholamine secretion. Using primary cultures and specific stimulation of chromaffin cells, we demonstrate that PACAP-38 induced an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) that was blocked by PACAP (6-38), was independent of external Ca(2+), and originated from thapsigargin-insensitive internal stores. The PACAP-triggered Ca(2+) increase was not affected by inhibition of PLC beta (preincubation with U-73122) or by pretreatment of cells with Xestospongin C, indicating that the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive stores were not mobilized. However, forskolin (FSK), which raises cytosolic cAMP, induced an increase in Ca(2+) similar to that recorded with PACAP-38. Blockage of PKA by H-89 or (R(p))-cAMPS suppressed both PACAP-38 and FSK calcium responses. The effect of PACAP-38 was also abolished by emptying the caffeine/ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) stores. Furthermore, treatment of cells with orthovanadate (100 microm) impaired Ca(2+) reloading of PACAP-sensitive stores indicating that PACAP-38 can mobilize Ca(2+) from secretory vesicles. Moreover, PACAP induced catecholamine secretion by chromaffin cells. It is concluded that PACAP-38, through the PAC(1) receptor, acts as a neurotransmitter in human fetal chromaffin cells inducing catecholamine secretion, through nonclassical, recently described, ryanodine/caffeine-sensitive pools, involving a cAMP- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation mechanism.',\n",
       " '12434297': 'Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive and potent disease, which is largely resistant to conventional forms of treatment. However, the discovery of antigens associated with pancreatic cancer cells has recently suggested the possibility that immunotherapy might become a specific and effective therapeutic option. T cells within many epithelia, including those of the pancreas, are known to express the alphaEbeta7-integrin adhesion molecule, CD103. The only characterised ligand for CD103 is E-cadherin, an epithelial adhesion molecule which exhibits reduced expression in pancreatic cancer. In our study, CD103 was found to be expressed only by activated T cells following exposure to tumour necrosis factor beta 1, a factor produced by many cancer cells. Significantly, the expression of this integrin was restricted mainly to class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD8+ T cells. The human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 was transfected with human E-cadherin in order to generate E-cadherin negative (wild type) and positive (transfected) sub-lines. Using a sensitive flow cytometric adhesion assay it was found that the expression of both CD103 (on T cells) and E-cadherin (on cancer cells) was essential for efficient adhesion of activated T cells to pancreatic cancer cells. This adhesion process was inhibited by the addition of antibodies specific for CD103, thereby demonstrating the importance of the CD103-->E-cadherin interaction for T-cell adhesion. Using a 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assay it was found that CD103 expressing T cells lysed E-cadherin expressing Panc-1 target cells following T cell receptor stimulation; addition of antibodies specific for CD103 significantly reduced this lysis. Furthermore, absence of either CD103 from the T cells or E-cadherin expression from the cancer cells resulted in a significant reduction in cancer cell lysis. Therefore, potentially antigenic pancreatic cancer cells could evade a local anti-cancer immune response in vivo as a consequence of their loss of E-cadherin expression; this phenotypic change may also favour metastasis by reducing homotypic adhesion between adjacent cancer cells. We conclude that effective immunotherapy is likely to require upregulation of E-cadherin expression by pancreatic cancer cells or the development of cytotoxic immune cells that are less dependent on this adhesion molecule for efficient effecter function.',\n",

Binding experiments performed on various membrane preparations revealed that d[Cha(4)]AVP exhibits a nanomolar affinity for V1b receptors from various mammalian species (rat, bovine, human). It exhibits high V1b/V1a and V1b/oxytocin selectivity for rat, human, and bovine receptors. Furthermore, it exhibits high V1b/V2 specificity for both bovine and human vasopressin receptors. Functional studies performed on biological models that naturally express V1b receptors indicate that d[Cha4]AVP is an agonist. Like VP, it stimulated basal and corticotropin-releasing factor-stimulated ACTH secretion and basal catecholamine release from rat anterior pituitary and bovine chromaffin cells, respectively. In vivo experiments performed in rat revealed that d[Cha4]AVP was able to stimulate both ACTH and corticosterone secretion and exhibits negligible vasopressor activity. It retains about 30% of the antidiuretic activity of VP.

Additional support for the latter derives from the ability of recombinant G(919-1207) to support endothelial cell adhesion. In particular, endothelial cell adhesion to G(919-1207) is half-maximal at 1.4 nM, whereas residues 919-1018 and 1016-1207 of the G domain are poor cellular ligands.

Moreover, both alphavbeta3 and alpha3beta1 integrin bind with high affinity to G(919-1207). Together, our studies demonstrate that the G domain of laminin alpha4 chain is a specific, high affinity ligand for the alphavbeta3 and alpha3beta1 integrin heterodimers and that these integrins, together with alpha6beta1, function cooperatively to mediate endothelial cell-alpha4 laminin interaction and hence blood vessel development.

Here, we have identified from the human genomic sequence a family of three cytokines, designated interleukin 28A (IL-28A), IL-28B and IL-29, that are distantly related to type I interferons (IFNs) and the IL-10 family. We found that like type I IFNs, IL-28 and IL-29 were induced by viral infection and showed antiviral activity. However, IL-28 and IL-29 interacted with a heterodimeric class II cytokine receptor that consisted of IL-10 receptor beta (IL-10Rbeta) and an orphan class II receptor chain, designated IL-28Ralpha. This newly described cytokine family may serve as an alternative to type I IFNs in providing immunity to viral infection.',\n",
       " '12477859': 'We used a baculovirus-based system to prepare structural proteins of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1a. Binding of this preparation to cultured human hepatic cells was both dose dependent and saturable. This binding was decreased by calcium depletion and was partially prevented by ligands of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R), thyroglobulin, asialothyroglobulin, and antibody against a peptide in the carbohydrate recognition domain of ASGP-R but not preimmune antibody. Uptake by hepatocytes was observed with both radiolabeled and dye-labeled HCV structural proteins. With hepatocytes expressing the hH1 subunit of the ASGP-R fused to green fluorescent protein, we could show by confocal microscopy that dye stain cointernalized with the fusion protein in an area surrounding the nucleus. Internalization was more efficient with a preparation containing p7 than with one that did not. The two preparations bound to transfected 3T3-L1 cells expressing either both (hH1 and hH2) subunits of the ASGP-R (3T3-22Z cells) or both hH1 and a functionally defective variant of hH2 (3T3-24X cells) but not to parental cells. Additionally, uptake of dye-labeled preparation containing p7 was observed with 3T3-22Z cells but not with 3T3-L1 or 3T3-24X cells or with the preparation lacking p7, suggesting that p7 regulates the internalization properties of HCV structural proteins. Our observations suggest that HCV structural proteins bind to and cointernalize with the ASGP-R in cultured human hepatocytes.',\n",
       " '12482954': 'Notch receptors are single transmembrane receptors that contain a large number of epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGF repeats) in their extracellular domains. Mutations in the EGF repeats of the human Notch 3 receptor lead to the vascular dementia disease Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). The vast majority of CADASIL mutations are missense mutations removing or inserting cysteine residues in the EGF repeats, but it is not yet clear whether these mutations primarily affect receptor trafficking, maturation, andor signaling. To address this issue, we have generated and analyzed stable cell lines expressing either wild-type murine Notch 3 (mNotch 3) or the mutant mNotch 3(R142C), which corresponds to the prevalent CADASIL form of Notch 3, Notch 3(R141C) in humans. We find that a lower proportion of mNotch 3(R142C) is expressed in the site 1-cleaved configuration, and that reduced amounts of mNotch 3(R142C) appear at the cell surface, as compared with wild-type mNotch 3. This observation is accompanied by a higher propensity for mNotch 3(R142C) to form intracellular aggregates, which may be a result of increased accumulation or slowed transport in the secretory pathway. In contrast to the impaired cell surface expression, mNotch 3(R142C) signals equally well in response to Delta 1 and Jagged 1 as wild-type mNotch 3. Taken together, these data suggest that trafficking and localization rather than signaling of mNotch 3 are affected in mNotch 3(R142C).',\n",
       " '12486116': 'Fringe plays a key role in the specification of boundaries during development by modulating the ability of Notch ligands to activate Notch receptors. Fringe is a fucose-specific beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that modifies O-fucose moieties on the epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of Notch. To investigate how the change in sugar structure caused by Fringe modulates Notch activity, we have analyzed the sites of O-fucose and Fringe modification on mouse Notch1. The extracellular domain of Notch1 has 36 tandem EGF repeats, many of which are predicted to be modified with O-fucose. We recently proposed a broadened consensus sequence for O-fucose, C(2)X(3-5)(S/T)C(3) (where C(2) and C(3) represent the second and third conserved cysteines), significantly expanding the potential number of modification sites on Notch. Here we demonstrate that sites predicted using this broader consensus sequence are modified with O-fucose on mouse Notch1, and we present evidence suggesting that the consensus can be further refined to C(2)X(4-5)(S/T)C(3). In particular, we demonstrate that EGF 12, a portion of the ligand-binding site, is modified with O-fucose and that this site is evolutionarily conserved. We also show that endogenous Fringe proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Lunatic fringe and Radical fringe) as well as exogenous Manic fringe modify O-fucose on many but not all EGF repeats of mouse Notch1. These findings suggest that the Fringes show a preference for O-fucose on some EGF repeats relative to others. This specificity appears to be encoded within the amino acid sequence of the individual EGF repeats. Interestingly, our results reveal that Manic fringe modifies O-fucose both at the ligand-binding site (EGF 12) and in the Abruptex region. These findings provide insight into potential mechanisms by which Fringe action on Notch receptors may influence both the affinity of Notch-ligand binding and cell-autonomous inhibition of Notch signaling by ligand.',\n",

Therefore, it was proposed that NK cells recognized the \"missing self.\" We show here that the Ig-like CD160 receptor expressed by circulating CD56(dim+) NK cells or IL-2-deprived NK cell lines is mainly involved in their cytotoxic activity against K562 target cells. Further, we report that HLA-C molecules that are constitutively expressed by K562 trigger NK cell lysis through CD160 receptor engagement. In addition, we demonstrate, with recombinant soluble HLA-Cw3 and CD160 proteins, direct interaction of these molecules. We also find that CD158b inhibitory receptors partially interfere with CD160-mediated cytotoxicity, whereas CD94CD159a and CD85j have no effect on engagement with their respective ligands. Thus, CD160HLA-C interaction constitutes a unique pathway to trigger NK cell cytotoxic activity.',\n",
       " '12493742': 'Inhibins are endogenous antagonists of activin signaling, long recognized as important regulators of gonadal function and pituitary FSH release. Inhibin, in concert with its co-receptor, betaglycan, can compete with activin for binding to type II activin receptors and, thus, prevent activin signaling. Because bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) also utilize type II activin receptors, we hypothesized that BMP signaling might also be sensitive to inhibin blockade. Here we show that inhibin blocks cellular responses to diverse BMP family members in a variety of BMP-responsive cell types. Inhibin abrogates BMP-induced Smad signaling and transcription responses. Inhibin competes with BMPs for type II activin receptors, and this competition is facilitated by betaglycan. Betaglycan also enables inhibin to bind to and compete with BMPs for binding to the BMP-specific type II receptor BMPRII, which does not bind inhibin in the absence of betaglycan. Betaglycan can confer inhibin responsiveness on cells that are otherwise insensitive to inhibin. These findings demonstrate that inhibin, acting through betaglycan, can function as an antagonist of BMP responses, suggesting a broader role for inhibin and betaglycan in restricting and refining a wide spectrum of transforming growth factor beta superfamily signals.',\n",
       " '12496762': 'Communication between glial cells and neurons is emerging as a critical parameter of synaptic function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of glial cells to modify synaptic structure and physiology are poorly understood. Here we describe a repulsive interaction that regulates postsynaptic morphology through the EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand ephrin-A3. EphA4 is enriched on dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the adult mouse hippocampus, and ephrin-A3 is localized on astrocytic processes that envelop spines. Activation of EphA4 by ephrin-A3 was found to induce spine retraction, whereas inhibiting ephrin/EphA4 interactions distorted spine shape and organization in hippocampal slices. Furthermore, spine irregularities in pyramidal neurons from EphA4 knockout mice and in slices transfected with kinase-inactive EphA4 indicated that ephrin/EphA4 signaling is critical for spine morphology. Thus, our data support a model in which transient interactions between the ephrin-A3 ligand and the EphA4 receptor regulate the structure of excitatory synaptic connections through neuroglial cross-talk.',\n",

The neurite outgrowth response was inhibited by an antibody raised against the first Ig domain of Robo1/2 or by soluble Robo-Fc chimera. Furthermore, we show that the extracellular domains of Robo1 and Robo2 are homophilic adhesion molecules that can also interact with each other. These data suggest a wider range of functions for the Robo family in the development of the nervous system and provide novel insights into the molecular basis for the phenotypes observed in Robo mutants in Drosophila, C. elegans, and zebrafish.',\n",
       " '12506116': 'Leucine-rich repeat-containing, G protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) represent a unique subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors with a large ectodomain. Recent studies demonstrated that relaxin activates two orphan LGRs, LGR7 and LGR8, whereas INSL3/Leydig insulin-like peptide specifically activates LGR8. Human relaxin 3 (H3 relaxin) was recently discovered as a novel ligand for relaxin receptors. Here, we demonstrate that H3 relaxin activates LGR7 but not LGR8. Taking advantage of the overlapping specificity of these three ligands for the two related LGRs, chimeric receptors were generated to elucidate the mechanism of ligand activation of LGR7. Chimeric receptor LGR7/8 with the ectodomain from LGR7 but the transmembrane region from LGR8 maintains responsiveness to relaxin but was less responsive to H3 relaxin based on ligand stimulation of cAMP production. The decreased ligand signaling was accompanied by decreases in the ability of H3 relaxin to compete for (33)P-relaxin binding to the chimeric receptor. However, replacement of the exoloop 2, but not exoloop 1 or 3, of LGR7 to the chimeric LGR7/8 restored ligand binding and receptor-mediated cAMP production. These results suggested that activation of LGR7 by H3 relaxin involves specific binding of the ligand to both the ectodomain and the exoloop 2, thus providing a model with which to understand the molecular basis of ligand signaling for this unique subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors.',\n",
       " '12509413': 'The ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) comprise a large family of multidomain proteins with cell-binding and metalloprotease activities. The ADAM12 cysteine-rich domain (rADAM12-cys) supports cell attachment using syndecan-4 as a primary cell surface receptor that subsequently triggers beta(1) integrin-dependent cell spreading, stress fiber assembly, and focal adhesion formation. This process contrasts with cell adhesion on fibronectin, which is integrin-initiated but syndecan-4-dependent. In the present study, we investigated ADAM12/syndecan-4 signaling leading to cell spreading and stress fiber formation. We demonstrate that syndecan-4, when present in significant amounts, promotes beta(1) integrin-dependent cell spreading and stress fiber formation in response to rADAM12-cys. A mutant form of syndecan-4 deficient in protein kinase C (PKC)alpha activation or a different member of the syndecan family, syndecan-2, was unable to promote cell spreading. GF109203X and GÃ¶6976, inhibitors of PKC, completely inhibited ADAM12/syndecan-4-induced cell spreading. Expression of syndecan-4, but not syn4DeltaI, resulted in the accumulation of activated beta(1) integrins at the cell periphery in Chinese hamster ovary beta1 cells as revealed by 12G10 staining. Further, expression of myristoylated, constitutively active PKCalpha resulted in beta(1) integrin-dependent cell spreading, but additional activation of RhoA was required to induce stress fiber formation. In summary, these data provide novel insights into syndecan-4 signaling. Syndecan-4 can promote cell spreading in a beta(1) integrin-dependent fashion through PKCalpha and RhoA, and PKCalpha and RhoA likely function in separate pathways.',\n",
       " '12519790': 'Agonist exposure of many G protein-coupled receptors induces a rapid receptor phosphorylation and uncoupling from G proteins. Resensitization of these desensitized receptors requires endocytosis and subsequent dephosphorylation. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, the rat mu-opioid receptor (MOR1, also termed MOP) was found to be associated with phospholipase D2 (PLD2), a phospholipid-specific phosphodiesterase located in the plasma membrane, which has been implicated in the formation of endocytotic vesicles. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells coexpressing MOR1 and PLD2 confirmed that MOR1 constitutively interacts with PLD2. Treatment with the mu receptor agonist DAMGO ([d-Ala(2), Me Phe(4), Glyol(5)]enkephalin) led to an increase in PLD2 activity, whereas morphine, which does not induce MOR1 receptor internalization, failed to induce PLD2 activation. The DAMGO-mediated PLD2 activation was inhibited by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) but not by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C indicating that opioid receptor-mediated activation of PLD2 is ARF- but not PKC-dependent. Furthermore, heterologous stimulation of PLD2 by phorbol ester led to an accelerated internalization of the mu-opioid receptor after both DAMGO and morphine exposure. Conversely the inhibition of PLD2-mediated phosphatidic acid formation by 1-butanol or overexpression of a negative mutant of PLD2 prevented agonist-mediated endocytosis of MOR1. Together, these data suggest that PLD2 play a key role in the regulation of agonist-induced endocytosis of the mu-opioid receptor.',\n",
       " '12522143': 'Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is an endocytic receptor that binds multiple distinct ligands, including blood coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). FVIII is a heterodimeric multidomain protein that consists of a heavy chain (domains A1, a1, A2, a2, and B) and a light chain (domains a3, A3, C1, and C2). Both chains contribute to high-affinity interaction with LRP. One LRP-interactive region has previously been located in the C2 domain, but its affinity is low in comparison with that of the entire FVIII light chain. We now have compared a variety of FVIII light chain derivatives with the light chain of its homolog FVa for LRP binding. In surface plasmon resonance studies employing LRP cluster II, the FVa and FVIII light chains proved different in that only FVIII displayed high-affinity binding. Because the FVIII a3-A3-C1 fragment was effective in associating with LRP, this region was explored for structural elements that are exposed but not conserved in FV. Competition studies using synthetic peptides suggested that LRP binding involves the FVIII-specific region Lys(1804)-Ala(1834) in the A3 domain. In line with this observation, LRP binding was inhibited by a recombinant antibody fragment that specifically binds to the FVIII sequence Glu(1811)-Lys(1818). The role of this sequence in LRP binding was further tested using a FVIII/FV chimera in which sequence Glu(1811)-Lys(1818) was replaced with the corresponding sequence of FV. Although this chimera still displayed residual binding to LRP cluster II, its affinity was reduced. This suggests that multiple sites in FVIII contribute to high-affinity LRP binding, one of which is the FVIII A3 domain region Glu(1811)-Lys(1818). This suggests that LRP binding to the FVIII A3 domain involves the same structural elements that also contribute to the assembly of FVIII with FIXa.',\n",
       " '12522212': 'When blood coagulation factor IX is converted to activated factor IX (factor IXa), it develops enzymatic activity and exposes the binding sites for both activated factor VIII and the endocytic receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). In the present study we investigated the interaction between factor IXa and LRP in more detail, using an affinity-purified soluble form of LRP (sLRP). Purified sLRP and full-length LRP displayed similar binding to factor IXa. An anti-factor IX monoclonal antibody CLB-FIX 13 inhibited factor IXa.sLRP complex formation. Both the antibody and a soluble recombinant fragment of LRP (i.e. cluster IV) interfered with factor IXa amidolytic activity, suggesting that the antibody and LRP share similar binding regions near the active site of factor IXa. Next, a panel of recombinant factor IXa variants with amino acid replacements in the surface loops bordering the active site was tested for binding to antibody CLB-FIX 13 and sLRP in a solid phase binding assay. Factor IXa variants with mutations in the region Phe(342)-Asn(346), located between the active site of factor IXa and factor VIII binding helix, showed reduced binding to both antibody CLB-FIX 13 and sLRP. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the variant with Asn(346) replaced by Asp displayed slower association to sLRP, whereas the variant with residues Phe(342)-Tyr(345) replaced by the corresponding residues of thrombin showed faster dissociation. Recombinant soluble LRP fragment cluster IV inhibited factor IXa-mediated activation of factor X with IC(50) values of 5 and 40 nm in the presence and absence of factor VIII, respectively. This inhibition thus seems to occur via two mechanisms: by interference with factor IXa.factor VIIIa complex assembly and by direct inhibition of factor IXa enzymatic activity. Accordingly, we propose that LRP may function as a regulator of blood coagulation.',\n",

The related Dkk2, however, can function either as LRP6 agonist or antagonist, depending on the cellular context, suggesting that its activity is modulated by unknown co-factors. We have recently identified the transmembrane proteins Kremen1 and -2 as additional Dkk receptors, which bind to both Dkk1 and Dkk2 with high affinity. Here we show that Kremen2 (Krm2) regulates Dkk2 activity during Wnt signaling. In human 293 fibroblasts transfected dkk2 activates LRP6 signaling. However, co-transfection of krm2 blocks the ability of Dkk2 to activate LRP6 and enhances inhibition of Wnt/Frizzled signaling. Krm2 also co-operates with Dkk4 to inhibit Wnt signaling, but not with Dkk3, which has no effect on Wnt signaling. Likewise, in Xenopus embryos, Dkk2 and Krm2 co-operate in Wnt inhibition leading to anteriorized embryos. Finally, we show that interaction with Krm2 is mediated by the second cysteine-rich domain of Dkks. These results suggest that Krm2 can function as a switch that turns Dkk2 from an activator into an inhibitor of Wnt/lRP6 signaling.',\n",

PGI contains a CXXC motif, characteristic of redox proteins and possibly evolutionarily related to the CC and CXC motif of the chemokine gene family. Using site-directed mutagenesis, single- and double-deletion (CXC, CC) mutants were created by deleting amino acids 331 and 332 of human PGI, respectively. The mutant proteins lost their enzymatic activity; however, neither of the deletions augmented the proteins' binding affinity to the receptor and all maintained cytokine function.

The human Fn14 protein was recently identified as a cell-surface receptor for the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member named TWEAK (TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis). In the present paper, we report that the human TWEAK extracellular domain can also bind the murine Fn14 protein. Furthermore, site-specific mutagenesis and directed yeast two-hybrid interaction assays revealed that the TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) 1, 2, 3 and 5 adaptor molecules bind the murine Fn14 cytoplasmic tail at an overlapping, but non-identical, amino acid sequence motif. We also found that TWEAK treatment of quiescent NIH 3T3 cells stimulates inhibitory kappaBalpha phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) enhancer/luciferase reporter construct. Fn14 overexpression in transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells also promotes NF-kappaB activation, and this cellular response requires an intact TRAF binding site. These results indicate that Fn14 is a functional TWEAK receptor that can associate with four distinct TRAF family members and stimulate the NF-kappaB transcription factor signalling pathway.',\n",

       " '12529937': 'The discovery of receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMP) revealed a new principle for the function of G protein-coupled receptors. The initially orphan calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) was identified as a CGRP receptor when coexpressed with RAMP1. The same receptor is specific for adrenomedullin (ADM) in the presence of RAMP2. Calcitonin receptors (CTR) with 60% homology to the CRLR predominantly recognize calcitonin in the absence of RAMP. An amylin/CGRP receptor was recognized when a calcitonin receptor (CTR) was coexpressed with RAMP1. In the presence of RAMP3, the CTR only interacts with amylin. Noncovalent association of the RAMP with the CRLR or the CTR reveals heterodimeric RAMP/receptor complexes at the cell surface. Thus, two Class II G protein-coupled receptors, the CRLR and CTR, associate with three RAMP to form high affinity receptors for CGRP, ADM, or amylin. Here, the molecular composition and the functional properties of these receptors is reviewed.',\n",

(1995) Biochemistry 34, 2130-2136) that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) stabilizes a dimeric form of the natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA) by simultaneously interacting with both receptor subunits. However, the first crystallographic study of unliganded NPRA extracellular domain documented a V-shaped dimer involving a membrane-proximal dimer interface and separate binding sites for ANP on each monomer. We explored the possibility of an alternative A-shaped dimer involving a membrane-distal dimer interface by substituting an unpaired solvent-exposed cysteine for Trp(74) in the amino-terminal lobe of full-length NPRA. The predicted spacing between Trp(74) from both subunits drastically differs, depending on whether the V-shaped (84 A) or the A-shaped (8 A) dimer model is considered. In contrast with the expected results for the reported V-shaped dimer, the NPRA(W74C) mutant was constitutively covalently dimeric. Also, the subunits spontaneously reassociated following transient disulfide reduction by dithiothreitol and reoxidation. However, ANP could neither bind to nor activate NPRA(W74C). Permanent disulfide opening by reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide rescued ANP binding to NPRA(W74C). The NPRA mutant could be maintained as a covalent dimer while preserving its function by crosslinking with the bifunctional alkylating agent phenylenedimaleimides (PDM), the ortho-substituted oPDM being more efficient than mPDM or pPDM. These results indicate that the membrane-distal lobe of the NPRAM extracellular domains are dynamically interfacing in the unliganded state and that ANP binding stabilizes the receptor dimer with more stringent spacing at the dimer interface.',\n",

Using reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the four isoforms of preprotachykinin-A gene transcripts (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) were detected in the NT2-N. We also identified the presence of mRNA for neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), a primary receptor for SP, in the NT2-N cells. Concomitant with NT2 cell differentiation into neurons, SP and NK-1R mRNA expression increased consistently. Intracellular SP and cell membrane NK-1R immunoreactivity were all observed in NT2-N cells. Most importantly, we demonstrated that SP and NK-1R presented in NT2-N cells are functionally involved in the regulation of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta (MIP-1beta), an important beta-chemokine participating in the activation and directional migration of immune cells to sites of central nervous systems (CNS) inflammation. Thus, SP and its receptor may play an important role in modulation of neuronal functions related to regulation of immune activities within the CNS.

Mutual cross-desensitization between CCL2 and vCCL4 was demonstrated in the CCR2-transfected cells. The affinity of vCCL4 for the CCR2 receptor was 79 nm as determined in competition binding against radioactively labeled CCL2. In the murine pre-B lymphocyte cell line L1.2 stably transfected with the CCR2 receptor, vCCL4 acted as a relatively low potency but highly efficacious chemoattractant being equally or more efficacious in causing cell migration than CCL2 and CCL7 and considerably more efficacious than CCL8 and CCL13. It is concluded that human herpesvirus 6 encodes a highly selective and efficacious CCR2 agonist, which will attract CCR2 expressing cells, for example macrophages and monocytes, conceivably for the virus to infect and to establish latency in. It is suggested that vCCL4 during reactivation of the virus in for example monocyte-derived microglia could perhaps be involved in the pathogenesis of the CCR2-dependent disease, multiple sclerosis.',\n",

To translate these findings in in vivo settings, we have used an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) procedure to promote leukocyte-endothelium interactions in the mouse mesenteric microcirculation. In naive mice, the annexin 1 mimetic peptide Ac2-26 (20 to 100 microg administered intravenously prior to reperfusion) abolished I/R-induced cell adhesion and emigration, but not cell rolling. In FPR-deficient mice, peptide Ac2-26 retained significant inhibitory actions (about 50% of the effects in naive mice), and these were blocked by an FPR antagonist, termed butyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe, or Boc2. In vitro, neutrophils taken from these animals could be activated at high concentrations of formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (30 microM; fMLP), and this effect was blocked by cell incubation with peptide Ac2-26 (66 microM) or Boc2 (100 microM). FPR-deficient neutrophils expressed ALXR mRNA and protein. Both ALXR agonists, lipoxin A(4) and peptide Ac2-26, provoked detachment of adherent leukocytes in naive as well as in FPR-deficient mice, whereas the CXC chemokine KC or fMLP were inactive.

However, the apparent potency of AM, like that of CGRP, approached that of CT when CTR(I1-) was co-expressed with RAMP. CGRP- or AM-evoked cAMP production was strongly inhibited by salmon CT-(8-32), a selective amylin receptor antagonist, but not by hCGRP-(8-37) or hAM-(22-52), antagonists of CGRP and AM receptors, respectively. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of CT-(8-32) were much stronger in cells co-expressing CTR(I1-) and RAMP than in cells expressing CTR(I1-) alone.

In this study, we performed an extensive mutational analysis to identify the CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of murine IP-10. The mutants were characterized for heparin binding, CXCR3 binding, and the ability to induce chemotaxis, Ca(2+) flux, and CXCR3 internalization. Double mutations neutralizing adjacent basic residues at the C terminus did not lead to a significant reduction in heparin binding, indicating that the main heparin binding site of IP-10 is not along the C-terminal alpha helix. Alanine exchange of Arg-22 had the largest effect on heparin binding, with residues Arg-20, Ile-24, Lys-26, Lys-46, and Lys-47 further contributing to heparin binding. A charge change mutation of Arg-22 resulted in further reduction in heparin binding. The N-terminal residue Arg-8, preceding the first cysteine, was critical for CXCR3 signaling. Mutations of charged and uncharged residues in the loop regions of residues 20-24 and 46-47, which caused reduced heparin binding, also resulted in reduced CXCR3 binding and signaling. CXCR3 expressing GAG-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed that GAG binding was not required for IP-10 binding and signaling through CXCR3, which suggests that the CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of IP-10 are partially overlapping.',\n",
       " '12588872': 'Thrombin acts on many protein substrates during the hemostatic process. Its specificity for these substrates is modulated through interactions at regions remote from the active site of the thrombin molecule, designated exosites. Exosite interactions can be with the substrate, cofactors such as thrombomodulin, or fragments from prothrombin. The relative activity of alpha-thrombin for fibrinogen is 10 times greater than that for protein C. However, the relative activity of meizothrombin for protein C is 14 times greater than that for fibrinogen. Modulation of thrombin specificity is linked to its Na(+)-binding site and residues in autolytic loop-2 that interact with the Na(+)-binding site. Recombinant prothrombins that yield recombinant meizothrombin (rMT) and rMT des-fragment 1 (rMT(desF1)) enable comparisons of the effects of mutations at the Na(+)-binding residue (Asp(554)) and deletion of loop-2 (Glu(466)-Thr(469)) on the relative activity of meizothrombin for several substrates. Hydrolysis of t-butoxycarbonyl-VPR-p-nitroanilide by alpha-thrombin, recombinant alpha-thrombin, or rMT(desF1) was almost identical, but that by rMT was only 40% of that by alpha-thrombin. Clotting of fibrinogen by rMT and rMT(desF1) was 12-16% of that by alpha-thrombin, as already known. Strikingly, however, although meizothrombins modified by substitution of Asp(554) with either Ala or Leu or by deletion of loop-2 had 6-8 and <1%, respectively, of the clotting activity of alpha-thrombin, the activity of these meizothrombins for protein C was increased to >10 times that of alpha-thrombin. It is proposed that interactions within thrombin that involve autolytic loop-2 and the Na(+)-binding site primarily enhance thrombin action on fibrinogen, but impair thrombin action on protein C.',\n",
       " '12591959': 'Binding specificity between fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) is essential for mammalian development and is regulated primarily by two alternatively spliced exons, IIIb (\"b\") and IIIc (\"c\"), that encode the second half of Ig-like domain 3 (D3) of FGFRs. FGF7 and FGF10 activate only the b isoform of FGFR2 (FGFR2b). Here, we report the crystal structure of the ligand-binding portion of FGFR2b bound to FGF10. Unique contacts between divergent regions in FGF10 and two b-specific loops in D3 reveal the structural basis by which alternative splicing provides FGF10-FGFR2b specificity. Structure-based mutagenesis of FGF10 confirms the importance of the observed contacts for FGF10 biological activity. Interestingly, FGF10 binding induces a previously unobserved rotation of receptor Ig domain 2 (D2) to introduce specific contacts with FGF10. Hence, both D2 and D3 of FGFR2b contribute to the exceptional specificity between FGF10 and FGFR2b. We propose that ligand-induced conformational change in FGFRs may also play an important role in determining specificity for other FGF-FGFR complexes.',\n",
       " '12601009': 'The leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor comprises the low affinity binding chain gp190 and the high affinity converter gp130. The ectodomain of gp190 is among the most complex in the hematopoietin receptor family, because it contains two typical cytokine receptor homology domains separated by an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain. Human and murine gp190 proteins share 76% homology, but murine gp190 binds human LIF with a much higher affinity, a property attributed to the Ig-like domain. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the Ig-like domain, we mapped a LIF binding site at its carboxyl terminus, mainly involving residue Phe-328. Mutation of selected residues into their orthologs in the murine receptor (Q251E and N321D) significantly increased the affinity for human LIF. Interestingly, these residues, although localized at both the amino and carboxyl terminus, make a spatially unique LIF binding site in a structural model of the Ig-like module. These results demonstrate definitively the role of the Ig-like domain in LIF binding and the potential to modulate receptor affinity in this family with very limited amino acid changes.',\n",
       " '12603837': 'Abundant biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that presenilins are catalytic components of gamma-secretase, the protease responsible for generating the Alzheimer amyloid beta-protein. However, the differential localization of presenilins to early secretory compartments and gamma-secretase substrates to late secretory compartments and the plasma membrane (the \"spatial paradox\") argues against this view. We investigated this issue by studying the localization of nicastrin, another putative gamma-secretase component, and its association with presenilin-1 into proteolytically active complexes. Glycosidase digests revealed that nicastrin exists in multiple glycoforms and is terminally sialylated, a modification often associated with the trans-Golgi network. Trafficking of nicastrin to the trans-Golgi network was confirmed by density gradient fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy. In presenilin-deficient cells, however, nicastrin trafficking and maturation were abnormal, as the protein was restricted to early secretory compartments and failed to be sialylated. Mature sialylated nicastrin in trans-Golgi network fractions was complexed quantitatively with N- and C-terminal fragments of presenilin-1, whereas immature nicastrin present in early secretory compartments was not. Additionally, trans-Golgi network fractions contained the gamma-secretase substrate beta-amyloid precursor protein C83 and were enriched in presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase proteolytic activity. The results resolve the apparent spatial paradox by demonstrating that presenilin-nicastrin complexes and presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase activity are co-localized to a late secretory compartment. The findings provide further evidence that presenilin-containing complexes are the gamma-secretase, and indicate that presenilins also regulate gamma-secretase assembly.',\n",

However, little is known about the physiological roles of this ligand-receptor pairing. In the present study we investigated the pharmacology of several apelin analogues at the human recombinant APJ receptor using radioligand binding and functional assays. This has led to the identification of key residues in the apelin peptide required for functional potency and binding affinity through structure-activity studies. In particular, we have identified that replacement of leucine in position 5, or arginine in position 2 and 4 of the C-terminal apelin peptide, apelin-13, resulted in significant changes in pharmacology. We also investigated the detailed localization of pre-proapelin and APJ receptor mRNA in a wide range of human, rat and mouse tissues using quantitative RT-PCR, and carried out a detailed immunohistochemical study of the distribution of the APJ receptor in rat brain and spinal cord. Interestingly, the APJ receptor was not only co-localized in white matter with GFAP in the spinal cord, but was also clearly localized on neurones in the brain, suggesting that this receptor and its peptide may be involved in a wide range of biological process yet to be determined.',\n",

To this end, four PAR(2) mutants with altered tryptic cleavage sites were prepared (PAR(2)R(36)A, PAR(2)S(37)P, PAR(2)R(41)A, and PAR(2)R(36)AR(41)A), expressed in Kirsten virus-transformed rat kidney cells and were evaluated together with the wild-type PAR(2)-expressing cells for 1) activation (Ca(2+) signaling) by trypsin and the receptor-activating peptide SLIGRL-NH(2) (SL-NH(2)) and 2) the tryptic release of two antigenic receptor determinants, one N-terminal to the R(36)/S(37) cleavage/activation site detected by SLAW-A antibody and the second (detected by antibody, B5), N-terminal to residues K(51), K(72). None of the mutants resistant to cleavage at R(36) were activated by trypsin, yet all retained reactivity to B5 and all were activated by SL-NH(2). In contrast, trypsin activated both wild-type and PAR(2)R(41)A, leading to a disappearance of SLAW-A but not B5 reactivity. We conclude that, as opposed to the E. coli-expressed PAR(2) N-terminal polypeptide, PAR(2) expressed in intact cells displays selective tryptic cleavage at the R(36)/S(37) activation site, without cleaving downstream. Thus, in intact cells, trypsin activation does not concurrently \"disarm\" rat PAR(2), but leaves the \"tethered ligand\" persistently attached to the body of the receptor.',\n",

Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategies, we have cloned four transcripts encoding full-length activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7) and three novel ALK7 isoforms from the human placenta. The full-length ALK7 has 493 amino acids and exhibits all characteristics of TGFbeta type I receptors, including an activin receptor-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, a GS domain, and a serine/threonine kinase domain. The three ALK7 isoforms identified include a truncated ALK7 (tALK7) and two soluble proteins designated as soluble ALK7a (sALK7a) and soluble ALK7b (sALK7b). The tALK7 lacks the first 50 amino acids of the full-length ALK7, resulting in a truncated receptor-binding domain. Both sALK7a and sALK7b lack transmembrane and GS domains. The ALK7 gene, located on chromosome 2q24.1, is composed of at least nine exons and eight introns. The isoforms of ALK7 are generated by alternative splicing. Transcripts encoding the sALK7 isoforms differ from the full-length transcript by lacking exon III or both exons III and IV in sALK7a and sALK7b, respectively. The transcript for tALK7 uses an alternative exon located within the first intron of the full-length transcript. These results indicate that four distinct proteins are encoded by the human ALK7 gene. Both reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that ALK7 and its isoforms are expressed in human placentae of different stages of pregnancy and that their expression is developmentally regulated. In addition, mRNA expression of Nodal, a ligand for ALK7, was also detected in placentae of different gestational age. The role of Nodal and ALK7 in human placenta is currently under investigation.',\n",

In this study we investigated whether these RFamide peptides, which have common structural features in their C-terminal RFamide motif and share several physiologically important functions, could exert their effects through the same set of receptors. The affinity and functional activity of several related RFamide peptides were determined at the human neuropeptide FF receptor subtype 2 (hNPFF2) and the human prolactin-releasing peptide (hPrRP) receptors. The full-length human prolactin releasing peptide 31 (hPrRP31) had significantly higher efficacy compared with NPFF and its stable analog, (1DMe)Y8Fa, at the hNPFF2 receptor. In contrast, NPFF and (1DMe)Y8Fa were not efficacious at the hPrRP receptor. Our study indicated a generally relatively low level of discrimination for RFamide peptides at the NPFF receptor, whereas the hPrRP receptor clearly preferred PrRP or very closely related peptides. The seemingly promiscuous binding of the RFamide peptides to the NPFF receptor was further confirmed by receptor autoradiography. PrRP may thus signal through the NPFF receptors in vivo.',\n",

The interaction was evaluated in the rabbit gastric antrum with binding studies on membrane preparations and with contraction studies on muscle strips in the presence of selective antagonists under conditions of electrical field stimulation (EFS) or not. Binding studies indicated that the affinity (pK(d)) for the motilin receptor was in the order of ghrelin (4.23 +/- 0.07) < GHRP-6 (5.54 +/- 0.08) < motilin (9.13 +/- 0.03). The interaction of ghrelin with the motilin receptor requires the octanoyl group. Motilin induced smooth muscle contractile responses but ghrelin and GHRP-6 were ineffective. EFS elicited on- and off-responses that were increased by motilin already at 10(-9) M, but not by 10(-5) M ghrelin. In contrast, GHRP-6 also enhanced the on- and off-responses. The motilin antagonist Phe-cyclo[Lys-Tyr(3-tBu)-betaAla-] trifluoroacetate (GM-109) blocked the effect of GHRP-6 on the off-responses but not on the on-responses. Under nonadrenergic noncholinergic conditions, the effects of motilin and GHRP-6 on the on-responses were abolished; those on the off-responses were preserved. All responses were blocked by neurokinin (NK)(1) and NK(2) antagonists. In conclusion, ghrelin is unable to induce contractions via the motilin receptor. However, GHRP-6 enhances neural contractile responses, partially via interaction with the motilin receptor on noncholinergic nerves with tachykinins as mediator, and partially via another receptor that may be a GHS-R subtype on cholinergic nerves that corelease tachykinins.',\n",

Responses mediated by activation of both receptor subtypes with either orexin-A or -B were primarily dependent on extracellular Ca(2+), suggesting similar activation of Ca(2+) influx as we have previously shown for orexin-A and OX(1) receptors. Amino acid-wise truncation of orexin-A reduced its ability to activate OX(1) and OX(2) receptors, but the response mediated by the OX(2) receptor was more resistant to truncation than the response mediated by the OX(1) receptor. We also performed a sequential replacement of amino acids 14 to 26 with alanine in the truncated orexin-A variant orexin-A(14-33). Replacement of the same amino acids produced a fall in the potency for each receptor subtype, but the reduction was less prominent for the OX(2) receptor. The most marked reduction was produced by the replacement of Leu20, Asp25, and His26 with alanine. Interestingly, extracellular Ca(2+) dependence of responses to some of the mutated peptides was different from those of orexin-A and -B. The mutagenesis also suggests that although the determinants required from orexin-A for binding to and activation of the receptor are highly conserved between the orexin receptor subtypes, the OX(2) receptor requires fewer determinants. This might in part explain why orexin-B has the affinity and potency equal to orexin-A for this subtype, although it has 10- to 100-fold lower affinity and potency for the OX(1) receptor.',\n",

A shorter variant of this receptor lacking exon 1 was shown to have subnanomolar affinity for neuropeptide FF (NPFF), a pain modulatory peptide, and therefore was named NPFF(2) receptor. Here, we characterize the full-length cloned NPGPR and identify a novel short form lacking exon 2 with a differential pattern of mRNA abundance in several tissues and organs. The NPGPR is most similar to the recently cloned neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor which lacks exon 1, but also shows high homology to the orexin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor families, two neuropeptides involved in food intake regulation. Therefore, we used binding studies to examine the interaction of NPFF, orexin and NPY with the NPGPR. [125I] NPFF was displaced by NPFF with an IC(50) of 14.7 +/- 8.8 nM, whereas [125I] Orexin B was displaced by Orexin B with an IC(50) of 415 +/- 195 nM. We conclude that orexins interact with the NPGPR and that the affinity of NPFF for NPGPR is approximately 100-fold lower than for the NPFF2 receptor. We postulate that NPGPR is a splice variant of the family of NPFF receptors and displays a binding profile different from the other members of the NPFF receptor family due to the presence of exon 1. In order to evaluate whether NPGPR levels are affected by the feeding status, we examined the mRNA level using real-time PCR in two feeding models, i.e. before and after diet-induced body weight increase as well as after chronic food restriction in rats. However, hypothalamic NPGPR mRNA was unchanged in both models. Therefore, our evidence does not support the hypothesis that NPGPR is involved in feeding regulation.',\n",

Various collagen types bind to and activate the DDRs, but the molecular details of collagen recognition have not been well defined. In this study, recombinant extracellular domains of DDR1 and DDR2 were produced to explore DDR-collagen binding in detail. In solid phase assays, both DDRs bound collagen I with high affinity. DDR1 recognized collagen I only as a dimeric and not as a monomeric construct, indicating a requirement for receptor dimerization in the DDR1-collagen interaction. The DDRs contain a discoidin homology domain in their extracellular domains, and the isolated discoidin domain of DDR2 bound collagen I with high affinity. Furthermore, the discoidin domain of DDR2, but not of DDR1, was sufficient for transmembrane receptor signaling. To map the collagen binding site within the discoidin domain of DDR2, mutant constructs were created, in which potential surface-exposed loops in DDR2 were exchanged for the corresponding loops of functionally unrelated discoidin domains. Three spatially adjacent surface loops within the DDR2 discoidin domain were found to be critically involved in collagen binding of the isolated DDR2 extracellular domain. In addition, the same loops were required for collagen-dependent receptor activation. It is concluded that the loop region opposite to the polypeptide chain termini of the DDR2 discoidin domain constitutes the collagen recognition site.',\n",

We describe the 2.8 A resolution crystal structure of this entire extracellular region (sEGFR) in an unactivated state. The structure reveals an autoinhibited configuration, where the dimerization interface recently identified in activated sEGFR structures is completely occluded by intramolecular interactions. To activate the receptor, EGF binding must promote a large domain rearrangement that exposes this dimerization interface. This contrasts starkly with other RTK activation mechanisms and suggests new approaches for designing ErbB receptor antagonists.',\n",

Connection of the bioactive domains GIP1-14 and GIP19-30NH2 by EKEK or AAAA linkers resulted in peptide agonists with approximately 3-4-fold increased bioactivity as compared to GIP1-30NH2. Conformational analysis by CD spectroscopy of GIP fragments and analogues suggests a helical region in the C-terminal (19-30) portion of GIP. It was demonstrated that stabilization of this C-terminal helical region by the introduction of helical linkers favored binding and activation of the GIP receptor. Our results suggest an important contribution of a direct interaction of the first 14 amino acids with the GIP receptor, an appropriate relative orientation of N- and C-terminal parts of GIP, and the presence of helical linkers to be essential for bioactivity.',\n",

Netrin-1 is expressed in prelumenal cells, and its receptor neogenin is expressed in a complementary pattern in adjacent cap cells of terminal end buds (TEBs). We discovered that loss of either gene results in disorganized TEBs characterized by exaggerated subcapsular spaces, breaks in basal lamina, dissociated cap cells, and an increased influx of cap cells into the prelumenal compartment. Cell aggregation assays demonstrate that neogenin mediates netrin-1-dependent cell clustering. Thus, netrin-1 appears to act locally through neogenin to stabilize the multipotent progenitor (cap) cell layer during mammary gland development.

Human CNTF elicits cellular responses by induction of a receptor complex consisting of the CNTF alpha-receptor (CNTFR), which is not involved in signal transduction, and the beta-receptors gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Previous studies with rat CNTF demonstrated that rat CNTF is unable to interact with the human interleukin-6 alpha-receptor, whereas at high concentrations, it can directly induce a signaling heterodimer of human gp130 and human LIFR in the absence of the CNTF receptor. Here, we demonstrate that human CNTF cannot directly induce a heterodimer of human gp130 and LIFR. However, human CNTF can use both the membrane-bound and the soluble human IL-6R as a substitute for its cognate alpha-receptor and thus widen the target spectrum of human CNTF.

The role of CCR8 was supported by the observation that vMIP-I, another CCR8-ligand identified from the genome of a T cell transforming herpes virus, shared CCL1 anti-apoptotic activity. In addition to CCR8, BW5147 cells also expressed the CXCR4 receptor but its ligand, SDF-1 (CXCL12) showed only a modest anti-apoptotic activity. Other chemokines acting on CCR2, CCR4 and CCR5 failed to protect against apoptosis and to induce BW5147 chemotaxis, suggesting that these receptors were not functionally expressed. By contrast, both CCL1 and vMIP-I up-regulated ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation in BW5147 cells. Further analysis demonstrated that CCL1 activates the MAPK pathway in CCR8-transfected CHO cells.

Agonists induced a concentration-dependent association of beta-arrestin 2 with all four receptors.

Interestingly, when evaluated at the Y4 receptor, the Y4 agonist 1229U91 [(Ile,Glu,Pro,Dpr,Tyr,Arg, Leu,Arg,Try-NH2)-2-cyclic(2,4'),(2',4)-diamide] was unable to provoke the same maximal response as human PP, suggesting that 1229U91 is a partial agonist. When stimulated by PYY, the Y5 receptor responded with a t(1/2) of 4.6 min and a maximal response approximately 60% of what was observed with Y1. Because beta-arrestins are key components in GPCR internalization, it is interesting to note that the receptor that is known to internalize rapidly (Y1) exhibits the most rapid association with beta-arrestin 2, whereas the receptor that is known to internalize slowly, or not at all (Y2) associates slowly with beta-arrestin 2.\",\n",
       " '12667445': 'Activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) elicit diverse biological responses by signaling through two pairs of structurally related type I and type II receptors. Here we report the crystal structure of BMP7 in complex with the extracellular domain (ECD) of the activin type II receptor. Our structure produces a compelling four-receptor model, revealing that the types I and II receptor ECDs make no direct contacts. Nevertheless, we find that truncated receptors lacking their cytoplasmic domain retain the ability to cooperatively assemble in the cell membrane. Also, the affinity of BMP7 for its low-affinity type I receptor ECD increases 5-fold in the presence of its type II receptor ECD. Taken together, our results provide a view of the ligand-mediated cooperative assembly of BMP and activin receptors that does not rely on receptor-receptor contacts.',\n",
       " '12670700': 'Reelin, Disabled-1 (Dab1), apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), and very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) participate in a signaling pathway required for layer formation during mammalian brain development. Binding of Reelin to ApoER2 and VLDLR induces a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1, an adaptor protein that associates with the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors. However, Reelin has also been proposed to signal through integrin and protocadherin. Here we compare the roles of ApoER2 and VLDLR in Reelin signaling. We used layer-specific markers to identify the final positions of early- and late-born neurons in the cortices of mice lacking ApoER2, VLDLR, or both ApoER2 and VLDLR. Subtle alterations were observed in mice lacking VLDLR, whereas more severe abnormalities were detected in the absence of ApoER2, and major disruptions were obvious in mice lacking both receptors. Purified Reelin associated more readily with ApoER2 than with VLDLR and no synergy was observed in the presence of both receptors. Consistent with the binding data, the level of Reelin-induced Dab1 phosphorylation was more severely reduced in neurons lacking ApoER2 than in neurons lacking VLDLR. However, similarly low levels of Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation were observed in ApoER2(-/-) and VLDLR(-/-) mice in vivo. Finally, there was a complete absence of Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 in cortical neurons from mice lacking both ApoER2 and VLDLR. These findings demonstrate that ApoER2 and VLDLR are essential for Reelin signaling and that no other receptor molecules can compensate for their role in mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1.',\n",

Type-1 cytokines, particularly gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and IL-23, the major cytokines that regulate IFN-gamma production, are essential in CMI. This is illustrated by patients with unusual severe infections caused by poorly pathogenic mycobacteria and Salmonella species, in whom genetic deficiencies have been identified in several key genes in the type-1 cytokine pathway, including IL12RB1, the gene encoding the beta1 chain of the IL-12 and IL-23 receptors. Several mutations in IL12RB1 with deleterious effects on human IL-12R function have been identified, including nonsense and missense mutations. In addition, a number of coding IL12RB1 polymorphisms have been reported. In order to gain more insight into the effect that IL12RB1 mutations and genetic variations can have on IL-12Rbeta1 function, three approaches have been followed. First, we determined the degree of conservation at the variant amino acid positions in IL-12Rbeta1 between different species, using known deleterious mutations, known variations in IL-12Rbeta1, as well as novel coding variations that we have identified at position S74R and R156H. Second, we analyzed the potential impact of these amino acid variations on the three-dimensional structure of the IL-12Rbeta1 protein. Third, we analyzed the putative functions of different IL-12Rbeta1 domains, partly based on their homology with gp130, and analyzed the possible effects of the above amino acid variations on the function of these domains. Based on these analyses, we propose an integrated model of IL-12Rbeta1 structure and function. This significantly enhances our molecular understanding of the human IL-12 and IL-23 systems.',\n",

However, their functions during the early phases of the immune response are poorly documented. In the present study, we show that PGD(2 )inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, the CD40- and LPS-induced secretion of the Th1-driving factor IL-12 by murine splenic dendritic cells (DC), the most potent antigen-presenting cells. The inhibition of IL-12 production is mediated only in part by the cell surface G alpha s protein-coupled D prostanoid receptor (termed DP1) but not by the G alpha i protein-coupled DP receptor, DP2. We show that recruitment of DP1 in DC results in the activation of a cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway that is partially responsible for the inhibition of IL-12 production. We also suggest that the DP1-independent effects exerted by PGD(2) on IL-12 production may be due to the action of ist PGJ(2), but not PGF(2)alpha, metabolites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that PGD(2) affects NF-kappa B activation through (the) DP1-independent pathway(s). Together these data suggest that PGD(2), by interacting with DP1 and by binding to other target cellular proteins, may regulate immune responses by affecting IL-12 production in DC.',\n",
       " '12682249': 'The cytoplasmic domains of integrins play a key role in a variety of integrin-mediated events including adhesion, migration, and signaling. The molecular mechanisms that enhance integrin function are still incompletely understood. Because protein kinases are known to be involved in the signaling and the activation of integrins, the role of phosphorylation has been studied by several groups. The beta(2) leukocyte integrin subunit has previously been shown to become phosphorylated in leukocytes on cytoplasmic serine and functionally important threonine residues. We have now mapped the phosphorylated threonine residues in activated T cells. After phorbol ester stimulation, all three threonine residues (758-760) of the threonine triplet became phosphorylated but only two at a time. CD3 stimulation leads to a strong threonine phosphorylation of the beta(2) integrin, but differed from phorbol ester activation in that phosphorylation occurred only on threonine 758. The other leukocyte-specific integrin, beta(7), has also been shown to need the cytoplasmic domain and leukocyte-specific signal transduction elements for integrin activation. Cell activation with phorbol ester, and interestingly, through the TCR-CD3 complex, caused beta(7) integrin binding to VCAM-1. Additionally, cell activation led to increased phosphorylation of the beta(7) subunit, and phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that threonine residues became phosphorylated after cell activation. Sequence analysis by manual radiosequencing by Edman degradation established that threonine phosphorylation occurred in the same threonine triplet as in beta(2) phosphorylation.',\n",
       " '12682293': 'Tumstatin and endostatin are two inhibitors of angiogenesis derived from precursor human collagen molecules known as alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen and alpha1 chain of type XVIII collagen, respectively. Although both these inhibitors are noncollagenous (NC1) domain fragments of collagens, they only share a 14% amino acid homology. In the present study we evaluated the functional receptors, mechanism of action, and intracellular signaling induced by these two collagen-derived inhibitors. Human tumstatin prevents angiogenesis via inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis with no effect on migration, whereas human endostatin prevents endothelial cell migration with no effect on proliferation. We demonstrate that human tumstatin binds to alpha v beta 3 integrin in a vitronectin/fibronectin/RGD cyclic peptide independent manner, whereas human endostatin competes with fibronectin/RGD cyclic peptide to bind alpha 5 beta 1 integrin. The activity of human tumstatin is mediated by alpha v beta 3 integrin, whereas the activity of human endostatin is mediated by alpha 5 beta 1 integrin. Additionally, although human tumstatin binding to alpha v beta 3 integrin leads to the inhibition of Cap-dependent translation (protein synthesis) mediated by focal adhesion kinase/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway, human endostatin binding to alpha 5 beta 1 integrin leads to the inhibition of focal adhesion kinase/c-Raf/MEK1/2/p38/ERK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, with no effect on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 and Cap-dependent translation. Collectively, such distinct properties of human tumstatin and human endostatin provide the first insight into their diverse antiangiogenic actions and argue for combining them for targeting tumor angiogenesis.',\n",

Unlike activins, however, signaling by nodal, Vg1, and growth and differentiation factor 1 requires a coreceptor from the epidermal growth factor-Cripto-FRL1-Cryptic protein family such as Cripto. Cripto has important roles during development and oncogenesis and binds nodal or related ligands and ALK4 to facilitate assembly of type I and type II receptor signaling complexes. Because Cripto mediates signaling via activin receptors and binds directly to ALK4, we tested whether transfection with Cripto would affect the ability of activin to signal and/or interact with its receptors. Here we show that Cripto can form a complex with activin and ActRII/IIB. We were unable to detect activin binding to Cripto in the absence of ActRII/IIB, indicating that unlike nodal, activin requires type II receptors to bind Cripto. If cotransfected with ActRII/IIB and ALK4, Cripto inhibited crosslinking of activin to ALK4 and the association of ALK4 with ActRII/IIB. In addition, Cripto blocked activin signaling when transfected into either HepG2 cells or 293T cells. We have also shown that under conditions in which Cripto facilitates nodal signaling, it antagonizes activin. Inhibition of activin signaling provides an additional example of a Cripto effect on the regulation of signaling by transforming growth factor-beta superfamily members. Because activin is a potent inhibitor of cell growth in multiple cell types, these results provide a mechanism that may partially explain the oncogenic action of Cripto.',\n",

To investigate the structural determinants of ligand binding specificity, we examined the extracellular domain of human (h) RAMP1 using various deletion mutants. Co-expression of the hRAMP1 mutants with hCRLR in HEK-293 cells revealed that deletion of residues 91-94, 96-100, or 101-103 blocked [125I]CGRP binding and completely abolished intracellular cAMP accumulation normally elicited by CGRP or AM. On the other hand, the deletion of residues 78-80 or 88-90 significantly attenuated only AM-evoked responses. In all of these cases, the receptor heterodimers were fully expressed at the cell surface. Substituting alanine for residues 91-103 one at a time had little effect on CGRP-induced responses, indicating that although this segment is essential for high affinity agonist binding to the receptors, none of the residues directly interacts with either CGRP or AM. This finding suggests that RAMPs probably determine ligand specificity by contributing to the structure of the ligand-binding pocket or by allosteric modulation of the conformation of the receptor. Interestingly, the L94A mutant up-regulated surface expression of the receptor heterodimer to a greater degree than wild-type hRAMP1, thereby increasing CGRP binding and signaling. L94A also significantly increased cell surface expression of the hRAMP1 deletion mutant D101-103 when co-transfected with hCRLR, and expression of a L94A/D101-103 double mutant markedly attenuated the activity of endogenous RAMP1 in HEK-293T cells.',\n",

During development, CCN3 is expressed widely in derivatives of all three germ layers, and high levels of expression are observed in smooth muscle cells of the arterial vessel wall. Altered expression of CCN3 has been observed in a variety of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinomas, Wilm's tumors, Ewing's sarcomas, gliomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, and adrenocortical carcinomas. To understand its biological functions, we have investigated the activities of purified recombinant CCN3. We show that in endothelial cells, CCN3 supports cell adhesion, induces directed cell migration (chemotaxis), and promotes cell survival. Mechanistically, CCN3 supports human umbilical vein endothelial cell adhesion through multiple cell surface receptors, including integrins alphavbeta3, alpha5beta1, alpha6beta1, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In contrast, CCN3-induced cell migration is dependent on integrins alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1, whereas alpha6beta1 does not play a role in this process. Although CCN3 does not contain a RGD sequence, it binds directly to immobilized integrins alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1, with half-maximal binding occurring at 10 nm and 50 nm CCN3, respectively. Furthermore, CCN3 induces neovascularization when implanted in rat cornea, demonstrating that it is a novel angiogenic inducer. Together, these findings show that CCN3 is a ligand of integrins alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1, acts directly upon endothelial cells to stimulate pro-angiogenic activities, and induces angiogenesis in vivo.\",\n",

Because these receptors are potential therapeutic targets, great interest has been devoted to the identification of efficient ligands that selectively activate or inhibit these receptors. A complete mapping of the CCK binding site in these receptors would help to design new CCK ligands and to optimize their properties. In this view, a molecular model of the CCK2R occupied by CCK was built to identify CCK2R residues that interact with CCK functional groups. No such study has yet been reported for the CCK2R. Docking of CCK in the receptor was performed by taking into account our previous mutagenesis data and by using, as constraint, the direct interaction that we demonstrated between His207 in the CCK2R and Asp8 of CCK (Mol Pharmacol 54:364-371, 1998; J Biol Chem 274:23191-23197, 1999). Two residues that had not been revealed in our previous mutagenesis studies, Tyr189 (Y4.60) and Asn358 (N6.55), were identified in interaction via hydrogen bonds with the C-terminal amide of CCK, a crucial functional group of the peptide. Mutagenesis of Tyr189 (Y4.60) and Asn358 (N6.55) as well as structure-affinity studies with modified CCK analogs validated these interactions and the involvement of both residues in the CCK binding site. These results indicate that the present molecular model is an important tool to identify direct contact points between CCK and the CCK2R and to rapidly progress in mapping of the CCK2R binding site. Moreover, comparison of the present CCK2R.CCK molecular model with that of CCK1R.CCK, which we have previously published and validated, clearly argues that the positioning of CCK in these receptors is different.',\n",

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are unique because they induce the differentiation of mesenchymal cells toward cells of the osteoblastic lineage and also enhance the differentiated function of the osteoblast. However, the activity of BMPs needs to be tempered by intracellular and extracellular antagonists. BMPs bind to specific receptors and signal by phosphorylating the cytoplasmic proteins mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad) 1 and 5, which form heterodimers with Smad 4, and after nuclear translocation regulate transcription. BMP antagonists can be categorized as pseudoreceptors that compete with signaling receptors, inhibitory Smads that block signaling, intracellular binding proteins that bind Smad 1 and 5, and factors that induce ubiquitination and proteolysis of signaling Smads. In addition, a large number of extracellular proteins that bind BMPs and prevent their binding to signaling receptors have emerged. They are the components of the Spemann organizer, noggin, chordin, and follistatin, members of the Dan/Cerberus family, and twisted gastrulation. The antagonists tend to be specific for BMPs and are regulated by BMPs, indicating the existence and need of local feedback mechanisms to temper BMP cellular activities.',\n",

Yet, their ionic and signal transduction mechanisms have not been fully clarified. Here we show that orexins suppress G-protein-coupled inward rectifier (GIRK) channel activity, and this suppression is likely to lead to neuronal excitation. Cultured neurons from the locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus tuberomammillaris (TM) were used, as well as HEK293A cells transfected with GIRK1 and 2, either human orexin receptor type 1 (OX1R) or type 2 (OX2R), mu opioid receptor and GFP cDNAs. In GTPgammaS-loaded cells, orexin A (OXA, 3 microM) inhibited GIRK currents that had previously been activated by somatostatin (in LC cells), nociceptin (TM cells), or the mu opioid agonist DAMGO (HEK cells). In guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-loaded HEK cells, in which GIRK currents were not preactivated, OXA induced a biphasic response through both types of orexin receptors: an initial current increase and a subsequent decrease to below resting levels. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships revealed that both the OXA-induced and suppressed currents are inwardly rectifying with reversal potentials around EK. The OXA-induced initial current was partially pertussis toxin (PTX) sensitive and partially PTX insensitive, whereas the OXA-suppressed current was PTX insensitive. These data suggest that orexin receptors couple with more than one type of G-protein, including PTX-sensitive (such as Gi/o) and PTX-insensitive (such as Gq/11) G-proteins. The modulation of GIRK channels by orexins may be one of the cellular mechanisms for the regulation of brain nuclei (e.g., LC and TM) that are crucial for arousal, sleep, and appetite.',\n",

Over the past several years, it has become evident that IL-13 is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. IL-13 shares many functional properties with IL-4, stemming from the fact that they share a common receptor subunit, the alpha subunit of the IL-4 receptor (IL-4Ralpha). Characterization of IL-13-deficient mice, IL-4-deficient mice, and IL-4 receptor alpha-deficient (IL-4Ralpha(-/-)) mice have demonstrated nonredundant roles for IL-13. IL-13 mediates its effects by interacting with a complex receptor system comprised of IL-4Ralpha and two IL-13 binding proteins, IL-13Ralpha1 and IL-13Ralpha2. IL-13 receptors are expressed on human B cells, basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, respiratory epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. However, functional IL-13 receptors have not been demonstrated on human or mouse T cells. Thus unlike IL-4, IL-13 does not appear to be important in the initial differentiation of CD4 T cells into T(H)2-type cells but rather appears to be important in the effector phase of allergic inflammation. This is further supported by many in vivo observations, including that administration of IL-13 resulted in allergic inflammation, tissue-specific overexpression of IL-13 in the lungs of transgenic mice resulted in airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion, IL-13 blockade abolished allergic inflammation independently of IL-4, and IL-13 appears to be more important than IL-4 in mucus hypersecretion. Given the importance of IL-13 as an effector molecule, regulation at the level of its receptors might be an important mechanism of modulating IL-13 responses and thus propagation of the allergic response. Accordingly, IL-13 is an attractive, novel therapeutic target for pharmacologic intervention in allergic disorders. This review will summarize the current understanding of the IL-13 receptors and signaling pathways, emphasizing recent observations.',\n",

Binding to LIFR occurs through a binding site characterized by an FXXK motif located at the N terminus of helix D (site III). The immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of LIFR was modeled, and the physico-chemical properties of its Connolly surface were analyzed. This analysis revealed an area displaying properties complementary to those of the LIF site III. Two residues of the Ig-like domain of LIFR, Asp214 and Phe284, formed a mirror image of the FXXK motif. Engineered LIFR mutants in which either or both of these two residues were mutated to alanine were transfected in Ba/F3 cells already containing gp130. The F284A mutation impaired the biological response induced by LIF and CT-1, whereas the response to OSM remained unchanged. The Asp214 mutation did not alter the functional responses. The D214A/F284A double mutation, however, totally impaired cellular proliferation to LIF and CT-1 and partially impaired OSM-induced proliferation with a 20-fold increase in EC50. These results were corroborated by the analysis of STAT3 phosphorylation and Scatchard analysis of cytokine binding to Ba/F3 cells. Molecular modeling of the complex of LIF with the Ig-like domain of LIFR provides a clue for the superadditivity of the D214A/F284A double mutation. Our results indicate that LIF, CT-1, and OSM share an overlapping binding site located in the Ig-like domain of LIFR. The different behaviors of LIF and CT-1, on one side, and of OSM, on the other side, can be related to the different affinity of their site III for LIFR.',\n",

In patch-clamp experiments, effects of tyrosine kinase receptor blockers on C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP)-mediated depolarizations of membrane voltages (Vm) of IHKE-1 cells were tested. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor blocker genistein (10 microM) abolished the effect of CNP (0.2 +/- 0.4 mV, n = 7), and comparable results were obtained with 10 microM daidzein (n = 8). Aminogenistein (10 microM, n = 5) and tyrphostin AG1295 (10 microM, n = 5) had no significant effects. EGF (1 nM) hyperpolarized cells by -5.3 +/- 0.8 mV (n = 5). This effect was completely blocked by genistein or daidzein. The Cl- channel blocker NPPB (10 microM, n = 5) inhibited the EGF-mediated hyperpolarization. mRNA expression of NPR-B and NPR-Bi shows reversed patterns along the human nephron. NPR-B is highly expressed in glomeruli and proximal tubules, whereas NPR-Bi shows strong signals in the distal nephron. Expression of NPR-Bi in the cortical collecting duct was also confirmed with immunohistochemistry. In other human tissues, NPR-Bi shows strongest expression in pancreas and lung, whereas in the heart and liver NPR-B is the dominating receptor. In conclusion, CNP inhibits an apical K+ channel in IHKE-1 cells independently of cGMP and so far this effect can only be blocked by genistein and daidzein. Tyrosine phosphorylation might be the missing link in the signaling pathway of CNP/NPR-Bi.',\n",

We subsequently cloned the precursor gene of the P52 ligand and characterized the activity of other possible peptides encoded by the precursor. This revealed an extended peptide, P518, which exhibited high affinity for SP9155 (EC50 = 7 nm). mRNA expression analysis revealed that the peptide P518 precursor gene is predominantly expressed in various brain regions, coronary arteries, thyroid and parathyroid glands, large intestine, colon, bladder, testes, and prostate.

Strangely, CCL27 can also be produced as a non-secreted form, as a result of alternative splicing. This protein, termed PESKY, is targeted to the nucleus where it is able to modulate transcription and alter cell morphology. Specifically, PESKY induces a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, manifest by the disruption of stress fibres. This consequently enhances cell motility.

The functional, soluble fragment of TALL-1 (sTALL-1) forms a virus-like assembly for its proper function. Here we determine the crystal structures of sTALL-1 complexed with the extracellular domains of BCMA and BAFF-R at 2.6 and 2.5 A, respectively. The single cysteine-rich domain of BCMA and BAFF-R both have saddle-like architectures, which sit on the horseback-like surface formed by four coil regions on each individual sTALL-1 monomer. Three novel structural modules, D2, X2 and N, were revealed from the current structures. Sequence alignments, structural modelling and mutagenesis revealed that one disulphide bridge in BAFF-R is critical for determining the binding specificity of the extracellular domain eBAFF-R to TALL-1 instead of APRIL, a closely related ligand of TALL-1, which was confirmed by binding experiments in vitro.',\n",

LPA has been widely considered to elicit its biological functions through three types of G protein-coupled receptors, Edg-2 (endothelial cell differentiation gene-2)/LPA1/vzg-1 (ventricular zone gene-1), Edg-4/LPA2, and Edg-7/LPA3. We identified an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, p2y9/GPR23, as the fourth LPA receptor (LPA4). Membrane fractions of RH7777 cells transiently expressing p2y9/GPR23 displayed a specific binding for 1-oleoyl-LPA with a Kd value of around 45 nm. Competition binding and reporter gene assays showed that p2y9/GPR23 preferred structural analogs of LPA with a rank order of 1-oleoyl- > 1-stearoyl- > 1-palmitoyl- > 1-myristoyl- > 1-alkyl- > 1-alkenyl-LPA. In Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing p2y9/GPR23, 1-oleoyl-LPA induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that mRNA of p2y9/GPR23 was significantly abundant in ovary compared with other tissues. Interestingly, p2y9/GPR23 shares only 20-24% amino acid identities with Edg-2/LPA1, Edg-4/LPA2, and Edg-7/LPA3, and phylogenetic analysis also shows that p2y9/GPR23 is far distant from the Edg family. These facts suggest that p2y9/GPR23 has evolved from different ancestor sequences from the Edg family.',\n",

Because thrombin is a potent cell modulator obligately produced at the site of clot formation, we hypothesized that the amount of cell-surface A2 and p11 might be altered by thrombin with consequent effects on plasmin generation. In support of this hypothesis, immunofluorescence microscopy and hydrophilic biotinylation experiments showed that both A2 and p11 were significantly increased on the surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with thrombin (0.8-8 nM) for 5 minutes followed by 1 hour at 37 degrees C. Intracellular immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analyses of whole cell extracts revealed increased p11 but unchanged A2 in response to thrombin, suggesting that transbilayer trafficking of A2 might be controlled by p11. The thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) similarly affected cells, demonstrating that cell signaling at least involved the type-1 protease activated receptor (PAR-1). An effect on the fibrinolysis pathway after treatment of HUVECs with thrombin was shown by increased fluorescein-labeled plasminogen binding to cells, which was inhibited by an antibody specific for p11. This was confirmed by observing that thrombin pretreatment of HUVECs increased biotin-modified plasminogen binding. Utilizing a chromogenic assay, pretreatment of HUVECs by thrombin further enhanced activation of the Glu and Lys forms of plasminogen by tPA. These data suggest a novel mechanism that links the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways by thrombin-mediated feedback.',\n",

To investigate the effect of N- and C-terminal residues of the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF in the binding affinity to the EGF receptor on A431 cell. We synthesized HB-EGF(44-86) corresponding to the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF and its N- or C-terminal truncated peptides. Thermolytic digestion demonstrated three disulfide bond pairings of the EGF-like domain in HB-EGF is consistent with that of human-EGF and human-TGF-alpha. HB-EGF(44-86) showed high binding affinity to EGF-receptor, like human-EGF. The truncation of the C-terminal Leu86 residue from HB-EGF(44-86), HB-EGF(45-86) or HB-EGF(46-86) caused a drastic reduction in the binding affinity to the EGF receptor. These results suggest that the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF plays an important role in the binding to the EGF receptor, and its C-terminal Leu86 residue is necessary for binding with the EGF-receptor. In addition, the deletion of the two N-terminal residues (Asp44-Pro45) from HB-EGF(44-86) caused a 10-fold decrease in relative binding affinity to the EGF receptor. This indicates that the two N-terminal residues of the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF are necessary for its optimal binding affinity to the EGF receptor.',\n",

There is recent evidence that NKB is expressed by the syncytiotrophoblast of the human placenta, an organ that is not innervated. We hypothesized that NKB is a paracrine modulator of tone in the fetal placental circulation. We tested this hypothesis using the in vitro perfused human placental cotyledon. Our data show that NKB is a dilator of the fetal vasculature, causing a maximal 25.1 +/- 4.5% (mean +/- SEM; n = 5) decrease in fetal-side arterial hydrostatic pressure (5- microM NKB bolus; effective concentration in the circulation, 1.89 nM) after preconstriction with U-46619. RT-PCR demonstrated the presence of mRNA for NK(1) and NK(2) tachykinin receptors in the placenta. Using selective receptor antagonists, we found that NKB-induced vasodilation is through the NK(1) receptor subtype. We found no evidence for the involvement of either nitric oxide or prostacyclin in this response. This study demonstrates a paracrine role for NKB in the regulation of fetal placental vascular tone.',\n",

In vivo data showed that deletion of exon 10 does not affect hCG action, whereas LH action is impaired. To investigate the role of exon 10 in LH/hCG action in vitro we created stable COS-7 cells expressing the LHR with (wt) or without (-ex10) exon 10. Binding experiments showed that the affinities of LH and hCG to the LHR wt and -ex10 were similar. Stimulation of wt with hCG or LH resulted in increased cAMP. cAMP production was significantly impaired in -ex10 stimulated with LH. This response was not altered by pertussis toxin, excluding that G(i) becomes activated in LHR -ex10. In desensitization experiments, intracellular cAMP of LHR wt and -ex10 declined to approximately 30%. No difference in intracellular cAMP was detected between LHR wt or -ex10 after recovery and restimulation with hCG or LH. These experiments show that impaired cAMP production of LHR -ex10 stimulated with LH is not due to anomalous receptor coupling or desensitization. We conclude that although exon 10 of the LHR plays no role in ligand binding, it is important for receptor activation by LH by a mechanism probably involving extracellular conformational changes.',\n",

A complex composed of the TGF-beta ligand and the type I and II receptors is required for signaling. The type II receptor is responsible for recruiting TGF-beta into the heteromeric ligand/type I receptor/type II receptor complex. The purpose of this study was to test for the extent that avidity contributes to receptor affinity. Using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor (the BIACORE), we captured the extracellular domain of the type II receptor (TbetaRIIED) at the biosensor surface in an oriented and stable manner by using a de novo designed coiled-coil (E/K coil) heterodimerizing system. We characterized the kinetics of binding of three TGF-beta isoforms to this immobilized TbetaRIIED. The results demonstrate that the stoichiometry of TGF-beta binding to TbetaRIIED was one dimeric ligand to two receptors. All three TGF-beta isoforms had rapid and similar association rates, but different dissociation rates, which resulted in the equilibrium dissociation constants being approximately 5pM for the TGF-beta1 and -beta3 isoforms, and 5nM for the TGF-beta2 isoform. Since these apparent affinities are at least four orders of magnitude higher than those determined when TGF-beta was immobilized, and are close to those determined for TbetaRII at the cell surface, we suggest that avidity contributes significantly to high affinity receptor binding both at the biosensor and cell surfaces. Finally, we demonstrated that the coiled-coil immobilization approach does not require the purification of the captured protein, making it an attractive tool for the rapid study of any protein-protein interaction.',\n",

In a solvent lacking Na(+), hydrolysis of a nitroanilide substrate is enhanced 1.6-fold by addition of PAR-3 polypeptide, with half-saturation at 2.5 microM. In contrast, the fibrinogen clotting activity of thrombin is inhibited completely by PAR-3, with a K(I) of 3 microM. None of the activities of thrombin are affected by addition of 50 microM PAR-4 polypeptide. Thus, PAR-3 in low concentrations binds thrombin in a configuration that blocks the anion-binding exosite but not the catalytic site, while hydrolysis of PAR-3, PAR-4, and other substrates that do not interact with exosite I persists. The allosteric effect of PAR-3 is characteristic of that of Na(+).',\n",

Cells transfected with the Duffy Ag internalize but do not degrade chemokine ligand. It has been proposed that Duffy Ag transports chemokines across the endothelium. We hypothesized that Duffy Ag participates in the movement of chemokines across the endothelium and, by doing so, modifies neutrophil transmigration. We found that the Duffy Ag transfected into human endothelial cells facilitates movement of the radiolabeled CXC chemokine, growth related oncogene-alpha/CXC chemokine ligand 1 (GRO-alpha/CXCL1), across an endothelial monolayer. In addition, neutrophil migration toward GRO-alpha/CXCL1 and IL-8 (IL-8/CXCL8) was enhanced across an endothelial monolayer expressing the Duffy Ag. Furthermore, GRO-alpha/CXCL1 stimulation of endothelial cells expressing the Duffy Ag did not affect gene expression by oligonucleotide microarray analysis. These in vitro observations are supported by the finding that IL-8/CXCL8-driven neutrophil recruitment into the lungs was markedly attenuated in transgenic mice lacking the Duffy Ag. We conclude that Duffy Ag has a role in enhancing leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation by facilitating movement of chemokines across the endothelium.',\n",

Both CCN proteins have been shown to support cell adhesion and induce cell migration through interaction with integrin receptors. Recently, we have identified integrin alphaMbeta2 as the major adhesion receptor mediating monocyte adhesion to CCN1 and CCN2 and have shown that the alphaMI domain binds specifically to both proteins. In the present study, we demonstrated that activated monocytes adhered to a synthetic peptide (CCN1-H2, SSVKKYRPKYCGS) derived from a conserved region within the CCN1 C-terminal domain, and this process was blocked by the anti-alphaM monoclonal antibody 2LPM19c. Consistently, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the alphaMI domain (GST-alphaMI) bound to immobilized CCN1-H2 as well as to the corresponding H2 sequence in CCN2 (CCN2-H2, TSVKTYRAKFCGV). By contrast, a scrambled CCN1-H2 peptide and an 18-residue peptide derived from an adjacent sequence of CCN1-H2 failed to support monocyte adhesion or alphaMI domain binding. To confirm that the CCN1-H2 sequence within the CCN1 protein mediates alphaMbeta2 interaction, we developed an anti-peptide antibody against CCN1-H2 and showed that it specifically blocked GST-alphaMI binding to intact CCN1. Collectively, these results identify the H2 sequence in CCN1 and CCN2 as a novel integrin alphaMbeta2 binding motif that bears no apparent homology to any alphaMbeta2 binding sequence reported to date.',\n",

Tage4 heterophilically trans-interacted with nectin-3, but not homophilically with Tage4.

The latent form, pro-MMP-2, is activated on the cell surface by the membrane-tethered membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP, in a process regulated by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2. A complex of active MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 binds pro-MMP-2 forming a ternary complex, which permits pro-MMP-2 activation by a TIMP-2-free neighbouring MT1-MMP. It remains unclear how MMP-2 activity in the pericellular space is regulated in the presence of TIMP-2. To address this question, the effect of TIMP-2 on MMP-2 activity in the extracellular space was investigated in live cells, and their isolated plasma membrane fractions, engineered to control the relative levels of MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 expression. We show that both free and inhibited MMP-2 is detected in the medium, and that the net MMP-2 activity correlates with the level of TIMP-2 expression. Studies to displace MT1-MMP-bound TIMP-2 in a purified system with active MMP-2 show minimal displacement of inhibitor, under the experimental conditions, due to the high affinity interaction between TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP. Thus inhibition of MMP-2 activity in the extracellular space is unlikely to result solely as a result of TIMP-2 dissociation from its complex with MT1-MMP. Consistently, immunoblot analyses of plasma membranes, and surface biotinylation experiments show that the level of surface association of TIMP-2 is independent of MT1-MMP expression. Thus low-affinity binding of TIMP-2 to sites distinct to MT1-MMP may have a role in regulating MMP-2 activity in the extracellular space generated by the ternary complex.',\n",

To investigate the relation between the chemokine receptor CXCR6 genotype and progression to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and from PCP to death, we clinically assessed and genotyped 805 individuals from an African-American injection drug-using cohort in Baltimore, MD, USA, for this CXCR6-E3K polymorphism. The allele frequency of CXCR6-3K was high (44%) in African Americans and rare in European Americans (f<1%). Although time to AIDS and PCP was similar for all CXCR6 genotypes, the median survival time from PCP to death for the CXCR6-3E/E and CXCR6-3E/K genotype was 1.5 years compared to 3.1 years for the CXCR6-K/K genotype. Individuals homozygous or heterozygous for the CXCR6-3E allele were 5.6 times more likely to die a PCP-mediated AIDS-related death than were individuals homozygous for CXCR6-3K. This study shows an association between CXCR6 genotype and progression from PCP to death among African-Americans with HIV. We suggest that CXCR6 may play a role in late-stage HIV-1 infection and may alter the progression to death after initial infection with PCP.',\n",

It was also demonstrated that ephrin-B2 and -B3, both of which are known to interact with EphA4, are expressed by spiral ganglion (SG) neurons. To investigate the functional role of EphA4 in the development of inner ear neurons, neonatal rat SG explants were cultured for 72 hours on uniformly coated surfaces or near stripes of EphA4/IgG-Fc-chimera. Control explants were cultured on or near IgG-Fc and EphA1/IgG-Fc-chimera. To assess the roles of ephrin-B2 and -B3 in EphA4 signaling, SG explants were cultured with or without anti-ephrin-B2 and/or -B3 blocking antibodies. Growth patterns of SG neurites at the border of EphA4 receptor stripes showed repulsion, characterized by turning, stopping and/or reversal. In the case of IgG-Fc and EphA1, the neurites grew straight onto the stripes. Treatment with either anti-ephrin-B2 or -B3 blocking antibodies significantly reduced the repulsive effect of an EphA4 stripe. Moreover, when both antibodies were used together, neurites crossed onto EphA4 stripes with no evidence of repulsion. The results suggest that EphA4 provides repulsive signals to SG neurites in the developing cochlea, and that ephrin-B2 and -B3 together mediate this response.',\n",

A wide variety of extracellular stimuli activate RhoA via G protein-coupled receptors. In the present study, we demonstrate a novel cell-cell interaction-mediated Rho activation signaling pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Among many receptor tyrosine kinases, the Eph family receptors are unique in that they require cell-cell interaction to engage their ligands, ephrin. We found that a novel VSMC-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho (Vsm-RhoGEF/KIAA0915) was expressed specifically in VSMCs of several organs including the heart, aorta, liver, kidney, and spleen, as examined by the immunohistochemical analysis using a specific antibody against Vsm-RhoGEF. Based on the association of Vsm-RhoGEF with EphA4 in quiescent cells, we tested whether EphA4 and Vsm-RhoGEF were expressed in the same tissue and further studied the molecular mechanism of Vsm-RhoGEF regulation by EphA4. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that EphA4 and Vsm-RhoGEF expression overlapped in VSMCs. Additionally, tyrosine phosphorylation of Vsm-RhoGEF induced by EphA4 upon ephrin-A1 stimulation enhanced the Vsm-RhoGEF activity for RhoA. The requirement of Vsm-RhoGEF for ephrin-A1-induced assembly of actin stress fibers in VSMCs was shown by the overexpression of a dominant-negative form of VSM-RhoGEF and by the depletion of Vsm-RhoGEF using RNA interference. These results suggested that ephrin-A1-triggered EphA4-Vsm-RhoGEF-RhoA pathway is involved in the cell-cell interaction-mediated RhoA activation that regulates vascular smooth muscle contractility.',\n",

A recombinant, soluble form of CD74 binds MIF with a dissociation constant of approximately 9 x 10-9 Kd, as defined by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore analysis), and soluble CD74 inhibits MIF-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in defined cell systems.

The chemokine CXCL4/PF4 shares several activities with CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, including a powerful angiostatic effect, but its specific receptor is still unknown. Here, we describe a distinct, previously unrecognized receptor named CXCR3-B, derived from an alternative splicing of the CXCR3 gene that mediates the angiostatic activity of CXCR3 ligands and also acts as functional receptor for CXCL4. Human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1), transfected with either the known CXCR3 (renamed CXCR3-A) or CXCR3-B, bound CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, whereas CXCL4 showed high affinity only for CXCR3-B. Overexpression of CXCR3-A induced an increase of survival, whereas overexpression of CXCR3-B dramatically reduced DNA synthesis and up-regulated apoptotic HMEC-1 death through activation of distinct signal transduction pathways. Remarkably, primary cultures of human microvascular endothelial cells, whose growth is inhibited by CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL4, expressed CXCR3-B, but not CXCR3-A. Finally, monoclonal antibodies raised to selectively recognize CXCR3-B reacted with endothelial cells from neoplastic tissues, providing evidence that CXCR3-B is also expressed in vivo and may account for the angiostatic effects of CXC chemokines.',\n",

The FXa-dependent inhibition of TF-FVIIa activity by TFPI leads to formation of the quaternary complex TF-FVIIa-FXa-TFPI.

Furthermore, a region that includes the N-terminal part of the TF2 domain and the C-terminal part of the TF1 domain, i.e. the residues 104 and 197, participates in the interaction with FXa in the quaternary complex.

Here we show that mixing NK cells with insect cells expressing HLA-C was sufficient to induce clustering of KIR, and phosphorylation of KIR and SHP-1. Transient phosphorylation of KIR was detected in the presence of pervanadate, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, at suboptimal concentration. Phosphorylation of KIR was specifically induced by ligand binding because it was detected only when HLA-C was loaded with a peptide that permits KIR binding. KIR phosphorylation was not dependent on ICAM-1-mediated adhesion and was not blocked by inhibition of actin polymerization, but required Zn(2+). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between HLA-C molecules revealed close molecular interactions induced by KIR binding. These results demonstrate tight clustering of KIR and rapid KIR phosphorylation induced simply by binding to HLA-C.

Levels of adiponectin in the blood are decreased under conditions of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Administration of adiponectin causes glucose-lowering effects and ameliorates insulin resistance in mice. Conversely, adiponectin-deficient mice exhibit insulin resistance and diabetes. This insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin seems to be mediated by an increase in fatty-acid oxidation through activation of AMP kinase and PPAR-alpha. Here we report the cloning of complementary DNAs encoding adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) by expression cloning. AdipoR1 is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas AdipoR2 is predominantly expressed in the liver. These two adiponectin receptors are predicted to contain seven transmembrane domains, but to be structurally and functionally distinct from G-protein-coupled receptors. Expression of AdipoR1/R2 or suppression of AdipoR1/R2 expression by small-interfering RNA supports our conclusion that they serve as receptors for globular and full-length adiponectin, and that they mediate increased AMP kinase and PPAR-alpha ligand activities, as well as fatty-acid oxidation and glucose uptake by adiponectin.',\n",

We have examined cell adhesion to assembled purified microfibrils, and its molecular basis. Human dermal fibroblasts exhibited Arg-Gly-Asp and cation-dependent adhesion to microfibrils and recombinant fibrillin-1 protein fragments. Strong integrin alpha 5 beta 1 interactions with fibrillin ligands were identified, but integrin alpha v beta 3 also contributed to cell adhesion. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis confirmed the presence of abundant alpha 5 beta 1 and some alpha v beta 3 receptors on these cells. Adhesion to microfibrils and to Arg-Gly-Asp containing fibrillin-1 protein fragments induced signaling events that led to cell spreading, altered cytoskeletal organization, and enhanced extracellular fibrillin-1 deposition. Differences in cell shape when plated on fibrillin or fibronectin implied substrate-specific alpha 5 beta 1-mediated cellular responses. An Arg-Gly-Asp-independent cell adhesion sequence was also identified within fibrillin-1. Adhesion and spreading of smooth muscle cells on fibrillin ligands was enhanced by antibody-induced beta1 integrin activation. A375-SM melanoma cells bound Arg-Gly-Asp-containing fibrillin-1 protein fragments mainly through alpha v beta 3, whereas HT1080 cells used mainly alpha 5 beta 1. This study has shown that fibrillin microfibrils mediate cell adhesion, that alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha v beta 3 are both important but cell-specific fibrillin-1 receptors, and that cellular interactions with fibrillin-1 influence cell behavior.',\n",

Recent studies have provided evidence for inhibitory functions of both members via PD-1. Meanwhile, compelling evidence exists for costimulatory function of both members. Here we demonstrate that expression of B7DC on the tumor cells promotes CD8 T cell-mediated rejection of tumor cells, at both the induction and effector phase of antitumor immunity. Moreover, B7DC binds to PD-1(-/-) cells and enhances T cell killing in a PD-1-independent mechanism. Our results demonstrate a novel pathway for B7DC to promote tumor immunity and may reconcile the apparently contradictory findings on the function of B7DC.',\n",

Netrins interact with members of two distinct families of transmembrane receptors, represented by DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) and UNC5. A human netrin fragment (soluble netrin; sNetrin) was purified from an engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line and used in a pull-down assay to map the interactions between netrin and its receptors. We find that sNetrin binds exclusively to the fifth fibronectin type III repeat of DCC and to each immunoglobulin repeat of UNC5. Both DCC and UNC5 bind to sNetrin with 1:1 stoichiometry in solution, and the minimal receptor fragments behave similarly to larger fragments in cross-linking experiments with purified sNetrin. We find no evidence for formation of a ternary complex between sNetrin and soluble forms of DCC and UNC5. We also find no evidence for an interaction between DCC and heparin and instead demonstrate that a loop on the fifth fibronectin type III repeat of DCC previously implicated in mediating interactions with heparin is important for sNetrin binding. Since netrin binds heparin, our results suggest that interactions between DCC and heparin are probably mediated by netrin.',\n",

Bovine milk LPL displaced both 125I-labeled alpha 2M* and 39-kDa alpha 2M receptor-associated protein (RAP) from the surface of cultured mutant fibroblasts lacking LDL receptors with apparent KI values at 4 degrees C of 6.8 and 30 nM, respectively. Furthermore, LPL inhibited the cellular degradation of 125I-alpha 2M* at 37 degrees C. Because both alpha 2M* and RAP interact with LRP, these data suggest that LPL binds specifically to this receptor. This was further supported by observing that an immunoaffinity-isolated polyclonal antibody against LRP blocked cellular degradation of 125I-LPL in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, 125I-LPL bound to highly purified LRP in a solid-phase assay with a KD of 18 nM, and this binding could be partially displaced with alpha 2M* (KI = 7 nM) and RAP (KI = 3 nM). Taken together, these data establish that LPL binds with high affinity to LRP and undergoes LRP-mediated cellular uptake. The implication of these findings for lipoprotein catabolism in vivo may be important if LRP binding is preserved when LPL is attached to lipoproteins. If so, LPL might facilitate LRP-mediated clearance of lipoproteins.',\n",

To examine the molecular mechanisms by which Notch regulates vascular development, we analyzed changes in gene expression in response to Notch signaling. Notch signal transduction and function were assessed in primary human endothelial cells isolated from the dermal microvasculature of neonates, HMVECd. We demonstrate that HMVECd cells express a heterodimeric form of endogenous Notch4 on their cell surface. Using an in vitro coculture assay, we found that Delta4 can function as a ligand for Notch4 in HMVECd cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of an activated allele of Notch4 upregulated the expression of Delta4, suggesting that there may be a regulatory loop between Notch4 and its ligand, Delta4. Notch4 activation also induced the expression of the transcriptional repressors, HES1, HERP1, and HERP2, as well as ephrinB2, an angiogenic factor proposed to be involved in arterial/venous endothelial cell specification.',\n",

Our previous studies have suggested that in addition to exoloops 2 and 3, several transmembrane domains of MC4R may be important for AGRP binding. However, the detailed molecular basis of MC4R domains in AGRP binding is presently unclear. The present studies were designed to determine the specific contribution of MC4R exoloops and transmembrane domains to AGRP binding by using chimeric receptor constructs of the human melanocortin-1 receptor (hMC1R), a receptor that is not inhibited by AGRP, and the human MC4R (hMC4R), a receptor that is potently inhibited by AGRP. Our results indicate that substitutions of the second and third extracellular loops of the MC4R with homologous domains of the MC1R dramatically decreased AGRP 87-132 binding affinity, but did not affect AGRP 110-117 binding affinity. In contrast, cassette substitutions of the third or fourth transmembrane domain of the MC4R with the homologous domain of the MC1R resulted in a substantial decrease of AGRP 87-132 binding affinity and loss of AGRP 110-117 binding affinity. These data suggest that the AGRP fragment 110-117 has no binding sites at exoloops of hMC4R and that transmembrane domains of MC4R may play an important role in AGRP 110-117 binding and function, whereas the exoloops do not. The second and third extracellular loops of MC4R are important for AGRP 87-132 N-terminal binding, whereas the third and fourth transmembrane domains of hMC4R are crucial for AGRP 110-117 binding.',\n",

It has recently been shown that besides interleukin-6 (IL-6), related cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostation M and interleukin-11 are also mediators of the hepatic acute-phase response. All these mediators belong to the hematopoietic family of alpha-helical cytokines. Here we show that an additional member of this cytokine family, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), induces the hepatic acute-phase protein genes haptoglobin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin and beta-fibrinogen in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) and in primary rat hepatocytes with a time course and dose-response comparable with that of IL-6. Our next aim was to define the receptor components used by CNTF on hepatic cells. Using a cell-free binding assay we exclude that CNTF binds to the 80 kDa IL-6 receptor, a protein with significant homology to the CNTF receptor which has recently been cloned from neuroblastoma cells. In human hepatoma cells (Hep3B) which lack the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, CNTF was not able to induce acute-phase protein synthesis, indicating that this receptor protein may be part of the functional CNTF receptor on hepatic cells.',\n",

TSP or a peptide (hep I) of the active site induces focal adhesion disassembly through binding to CRT, which activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) through Galphai2 proteins. Because CRT is not a transmembrane protein, it is likely that CRT signals as part of a coreceptor complex. We now show that low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) mediates focal adhesion disassembly initiated by TSP binding to CRT. LRP antagonists (antibodies, receptor-associated protein) block hep I/TSP-induced focal adhesion disassembly. LRP is necessary for TSP/hep I signaling because TSP/hep I is unable to stimulate focal adhesion disassembly or ERK or PI3K signaling in fibroblasts deficient in LRP. LRP is important in TSP-CRT signaling, as shown by the ability of hep I to stimulate association of Galphai2 with LRP. The isolated proteins LRP and CRT interact, and LRP and CRT are associated with hep I in molecular complexes extracted from cells. These data establish a mechanism of cell surface CRT signaling through its coreceptor, LRP, and suggest a novel function for LRP in regulating cell adhesion.',\n",

Ang-(1-7) has become an angiotensin of interest in the past few years, because its cardiovascular and baroreflex actions counteract those of Ang II. Unique angiotensin-binding sites specific for this heptapeptide and studies with a selective Ang-(1-7) antagonist indicated the existence of a distinct Ang-(1-7) receptor. We demonstrate that genetic deletion of the G protein-coupled receptor encoded by the Mas protooncogene abolishes the binding of Ang-(1-7) to mouse kidneys. Accordingly, Mas-deficient mice completely lack the antidiuretic action of Ang-(1-7) after an acute water load. Ang-(1-7) binds to Mas-transfected cells and elicits arachidonic acid release. Furthermore, Mas-deficient aortas lose their Ang-(1-7)-induced relaxation response.

Association of NCAM with GFRalpha1, a GPI-anchored receptor for GDNF, downregulates NCAM-mediated cell adhesion and promotes high-affinity binding of GDNF to p140(NCAM), resulting in rapid activation of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases Fyn and FAK in cells lacking RET, a known GDNF signaling receptor. GDNF stimulates Schwann cell migration and axonal growth in hippocampal and cortical neurons via binding to NCAM and activation of Fyn, but independently of RET. These results uncover an unexpected intersection between short- and long-range mechanisms of intercellular communication and reveal a pathway for GDNF signaling that does not require the RET receptor.',\n",

By deletion analysis, we show that the binding of soluble fragments of Nogo, MAG and NgR to cell-surface NgR requires the entire leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region of NgR, but not other portions of the protein. Despite sharing extensive sequence similarity with NgR, two related proteins, NgR2 and NgR3, which we have identified, do not bind Nogo, MAG, OMgp or NgR. To investigate NgR specificity and multi-ligand binding, we determined the crystal structure of the biologically active ligand-binding soluble ectodomain of NgR. The molecule is banana shaped with elongation and curvature arising from eight LRRs flanked by an N-terminal cap and a small C-terminal subdomain.

Northern blot analysis demonstrated that UGRP1 is specifically expressed by lung, but not by the other tissues examined. By in situ hybridization experiments, UGRP1 was shown to be expressed by lung Clara-like cells in the bronchial epithelium and to be up-regulated in cystic fibrosis. In a mammalian expression system, secreted recombinant UGRP1 was copurified with apolipoprotein A-I. Using a retroviral vector-mediated expression cloning approach, we identified macrophage scavenger receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) as a receptor for UGRP1. Northern blot and in situ hybridization experiments indicated that MARCO is expressed by alveolar macrophages in the lung. UGRP1 also bound to bacteria and yeast.

Although these ILTs have been shown to recognize a broad range of classical and nonclassical human MHC class I molecules (MHCIs), their precise binding properties remain controversial. We have used surface plasmon resonance to analyze the interaction of soluble forms of ILT4 and ILT2 with several MHCIs. Although the range of affinities measured was quite broad (Kd = 2-45 microM), some interesting differences were observed. ILT2 generally bound with a 2- to 3-fold higher affinity than ILT4 to the same MHCI. Furthermore, ILT2 and ILT4 bound to HLA-G with a 3- to 4-fold higher affinity than to classical MHCIs, suggesting that ILT/HLA-G recognition may play a dominant role in the regulation of natural killer, T, and myelomonocytic cell activation.

To identify a receptor complex for this WNT family member, we have analyzed the response of the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 to WNT7A. We find that PC12 cells are capable of responding to WNT7A as measured by increased beta-catenin stability and activation of a T-cell factor-based luciferase reporter construct and that these cells express three members of the Frizzled family (Frizzled-2, -5, and -7) and LRP6.

We show here that phosphorylation of ABCA1 in HEK293 cells was reduced by 63 +/- 2.4% after removal of the PEST sequence (ABCA1delPEST) or by incubation of cells with apoAI (58 +/- 3.3%). By contrast, ABCA1delPEST showed no further decrease of phosphorylation upon apoAI treatment. To assess the hypothesis that PEST sequence phosphorylation could regulate ABCA1 calpain proteolysis, we mutagenized S/T residues in the PEST sequence and identified Thr-1286 and Thr-1305 as constitutively phosphorylated residues. The ABCA1-T1286A/T1305A mutant was not degraded by calpain and was not further stabilized upon apoA-I treatment. The T1286A/T1305A mutant showed a 3.1-fold increase in cell surface expression and a 2.3-fold increase of apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux compared with wild type ABCA1. In conclusion, we propose a mechanism of regulation of ABCA1 cell surface expression and function in which the interaction with apoA-I results in dephosphorylation of the ABCA1 PEST sequence and thereby inhibits calpain degradation leading to an increase of ABCA1 cell surface expression.',\n",

Comparison of the sequence of the HLA-G molecule to other class I MHC proteins revealed two unique cysteine residues located in positions 42 and 147. Mutating these cysteine residues resulted in a dramatic decrease in LIR-1 Ig binding. Accordingly, the mutated HLA-G transfectants were less effective in the inhibition of NK killing and RBL/LIR-1 induced serotonin release. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the involvement of the cysteine residues in the formation of HLA-G protein oligomers on the cell surface. The cysteine residue located at position 42 is shown to be critical for the expression of such complexes.

Of the three VEGF receptors (VEGFR), VEGFR-1 and -2 are expressed on blood vessels; VEGFR-2 is found also on lymphatic vessels. VEGFR-3 is expressed mainly on lymphatic vessels but it is also up-regulated in tumor angiogenesis. Although VEGFR-3 is essential for proper lymphatic development, its signal transduction mechanisms are still incompletely understood. Trans-phosphorylation of activated, dimerized receptor tyrosine kinases is known to be critical for the regulation of kinase activity and for receptor interaction with signal transduction molecules. In this study, we have identified five tyrosyl phosphorylation sites in the VEGFR-3 carboxyl-terminal tail. These sites were used both in VEGFR-3 overexpressed in 293 cells and when the endogenous VEGFR-3 was activated in lymphatic endothelial cells. Interestingly, VEGF-C stimulation of lymphatic endothelial cells also induced the formation of VEGFR-3/VEGFR-2 heterodimers, in which VEGFR-3 was phosphorylated only at three of the five sites while the two most carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues appeared not to be accessible for the VEGFR-2 kinase. Our data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal tail of VEGFR-3 provides important regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation sites with potential signal transduction capacity and that these sites are differentially used in ligand-induced homo- and heterodimeric receptor complexes.',\n",

Mouse CD100 plays a crucial role in both humoral and cellular immunity through ligation of the lymphocyte receptor, CD72. It remains controversial, however, whether human CD100 can function through human CD72 in a manner similar to mouse CD100. To determine the function of human CD100, we generated a recombinant soluble human CD100 protein comprised of the extracellular region of human CD100 fused to the human IgG1 Fc region (hCD100-Fc). hCD100-Fc specifically binds to cells expressing human CD72. As observed previously in the mouse, hCD100-Fc induces the tyrosine dephosphorylation of human CD72, leading to the dissociation of SHP-1 from the CD72 cytoplasmic tail. Consistent with findings for mouse CD100, hCD100-Fc exerts a co-stimulatory effect on B cells and dendritic cells that are stimulated with anti-CD40 mAb. Furthermore, both hCD100-Fc and anti-human CD72 agonistic mAb induce the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8, even in the absence of anti-CD40 mAb. Collectively, our findings not only demonstrate that human CD100, interacting with human CD72, can function as a ligand in a manner similar to mouse CD100, but also suggest the involvement of human CD100 in inflammatory responses.',\n",

In contrast, the CCR3 agonists CCL11, CCL24 and CCL26 are involved in the recruitment of cells such as eosinophils and basophils during Th2 responses. Here, we report that although CCL11, CCL24 and CCL26 are neither agonists nor antagonists of CXCR3, CCL11 binds with high affinity to CXCR3. This suggests that, in vivo, CXCR3 may act as a decoy receptor, sequestering locally produced CCL11. We also demonstrate that the CXCR3 ligands inhibit CCR3-mediated functional responses of both human eosinophils and CCR3 transfectants induced by all three eotaxins, with CXCL11 being the most efficacious antagonist. The examination of CCR3-CCR1 chimeric constructs revealed that CCL11 and CXCL11 share overlapping binding sites contained within the CCR3 extracellular loops, a region that was previously shown to be essential for effective receptor-activation. Hence, eosinophil responses mediated by chemokines acting at CCR3 may be regulated by two distinct mechanisms: the antagonistic effects of CXCR3 ligands and the sequestration of CCL11 by CXCR3-expressing cells. Such interplay may serve to finely tune inflammatory responses in vivo.',\n",

These effects require alpha 3 beta 1 integrin-mediated binding of TIMP-2 to endothelial cells. Further, TIMP-2 induces a decrease in total protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity associated with beta1 integrin subunits as well as dissociation of the phosphatase SHP-1 from beta1. TIMP-2 treatment also results in a concomitant increase in PTP activity associated with tyrosine kinase receptors FGFR-1 and KDR.

We report that TNFR1-induced apoptosis involves two sequential signaling complexes. The initial plasma membrane bound complex (complex I) consists of TNFR1, the adaptor TRADD, the kinase RIP1, and TRAF2 and rapidly signals activation of NF-kappa B. In a second step, TRADD and RIP1 associate with FADD and caspase-8, forming a cytoplasmic complex (complex II). When NF-kappa B is activated by complex I, complex II harbors the caspase-8 inhibitor FLIP(L) and the cell survives. Thus, TNFR1-mediated-signal transduction includes a checkpoint, resulting in cell death (via complex II) in instances where the initial signal (via complex I, NF-kappa B) fails to be activated.',\n",

We recently identified endoglycan as a new member of the CD34 family. We report here that endoglycan, like the two other members of this family (CD34 and podocalyxin) can function as a L-selectin ligand. However, endoglycan employs a different binding mechanism, interacting with L-selectin through sulfation on two tyrosine residues and O-linked sLex structures that are presented within its highly acidic amino-terminal region. Our analysis establishes striking parallels with PSGL-1, a leukocyte ligand that interacts with all three selectins, mediating leukocyte-endothelial, leukocyte-leukocyte, and platelet-leukocyte interactions. Since the distribution of endoglycan includes hematopoietic precursors and leukocyte subpopulations, in addition to endothelial cells, our findings suggest several potential settings for endoglycan-mediated adhesion events.',\n",

In this study, we generated soluble Ig fusion proteins of these molecules and examined the kinetics and relative affinities of the interactions between B7-H1 or B7-DC and PD-1 by flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance. The interaction of B7-DC/PD-1 exhibited a 2-6-fold higher affinity and had different association/dissociation kinetics compared with the interaction of B7-H1/PD-1.

Conversely, Wnts are shown to activate canonical signaling through LRP6 by inducing an intracellular conformational switch which relieves allosteric inhibition imposed on the intracellular domains.

ApoER2 is a cell surface molecule that elicits intracellular signal transduction through binding of Reelin. The structural requirements for Reelin binding to apoER2 and the receptor domains involved in this process are unclear at present. Using a series of receptor mutants, we characterized the interaction of apoER2 with Reelin and compared this interaction to that of apoER2 with the receptor-associated protein (RAP), an apoER2 ligand that does not induce signaling. By surface plasmon resonance we demonstrate that apoER2 exhibits 6-fold higher affinity for Reelin than the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), which also functions as a Reelin receptor (K(D) 0.2 nM versus K(D) 1.2 nM). Acidic amino acid residues in complement-type repeat domains 1 and 3 of apoER2 are required for Reelin binding. The same regions of the receptor are also bound by RAP with a 25-fold lower affinity (K(D) 5 nM). Whereas RAP binds to apoER2 with a 1:1 stoichiometry, experimental evidence suggests that Reelin associates with two or more receptor molecules simultaneously to achieve high-affinity interaction. This finding indicates that aggregation of apoER2 by multivalent ligands such as Reelin may be the structural basis for signal transduction.',\n",

However, some of the complex effects of C5a in vivo may not be explained solely by the deletion of the known receptor. Here, we show that an orphan receptor, identified as C5L2, is a high affinity C5a binding protein. Unlike the previously described C5aR, C5L2 is obligately uncoupled from heterotrimeric G proteins, in part by virtue of an amino acid alteration in the so-called DRY sequence at the end of the third transmembrane segment. Both human and murine C5L2 bear a leucine for arginine replacement at this site. C5L2, when transfected into several cell types, is weakly phosphorylated in transfected cells following binding of C5a but does not induce significant activation of MAP kinases, mediate calcium flux, or stimulate chemotaxis. Bone marrow cells from wild type respond robustly to C5a with induction and suppression of a number of inflammation related genes. In contrast, C5a receptor deficient mice, which bear C5L2 alone, do not respond to C5a with changes in gene transcription by microarray analyses. Biophysical properties of the C5L2, including slow ligand on and off rates, absence of internalization, and relatively high affinity for the C5a des Arg metabolite, suggest that this receptor may serve to modulate C5a biological functions in vivo.

Neutrophil recruitment is directed by transendothelial gradients of IL-8 that, in vivo, are bound to the endothelial cell surface. We have investigated the identity and function of the binding site(s) in an in vitro model of neutrophil transendothelial migration. In endothelial culture supernatants, IL-8 was detected in a trimolecular complex with heparan sulfate and syndecan-1. Constitutive shedding of IL-8 in this form was increased in the presence of a neutralizing Ab to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), indicating a role for endothelial plasminogen activator in the shedding of IL-8. Increased shedding of IL-8/heparan sulfate/syndecan-1 complexes was accompanied by inhibition of neutrophil transendothelial migration, and aprotinin, a potent plasmin inhibitor, reversed this inhibition. Platelets, added as an exogenous source of PAI-1, had no effect on shedding of the complexes or neutrophil migration. Our results indicate that IL-8 is immobilized on the endothelial cell surface through binding to syndecan-1 ectodomains, and that plasmin, generated by endothelial plasminogen activator, induces the shedding of this form of IL-8. PAI-1 appears to stabilize the chemoattractant form of IL-8 at the cell surface and may represent a therapeutic target for novel anti-inflammatory strategies.',\n",

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that DCs derived from CD34+ progenitors, but not from monocytes, expressed several receptors, in particular EphA2, EphA4, EphA7, EphB1, and EphB3 mRNA. EphB3 was specifically expressed by Langerhans cells, and EphA2 and EphA7 were expressed by both Langerhans- and interstitial-type DCs. EphA and EphB protein expression on DCs generated in vitro was confirmed by staining with ephrin-A3-Fc and ephrin-B3-Fc fusion proteins that bind to different Eph members, in particular EphA2 and EphB3. Immunostaining with anti-EphA2 antibodies demonstrated the expression of EphA2 by immature DCs and by skin Langerhans cells isolated ex vivo. Interestingly, ephrin expression was detected in epidermal keratinocytes and also in DCs. Adhesion of CD34+-derived DCs to fibronectin, but not to poly-l-lysine, was increased in the presence of ephrin-A3-Fc, a ligand of EphA2, through a beta1 integrin activation pathway.

Ghrelin and a number of the known nonpeptide GH secretagogues acted as agonists stimulating inositol phosphate turnover further. In contrast, the low potency ghrelin antagonist, [D-Arg1,D-Phe5,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]-substance P was surprisingly found to be a high potency (EC50 = 5.2 nm) full inverse agonist as it decreased the constitutive signaling of the ghrelin receptor down to that observed in untransfected cells. The homologous motilin receptor functioned as a negative control as it did not display any sign of constitutive activity; however, upon agonist stimulation the motilin receptor signaled as strongly as the unstimulated ghrelin receptor. It is concluded that the ghrelin receptor is highly constitutively active and that this activity could be of physiological importance in its role as a regulator of both GH secretion and appetite control. It is suggested that inverse agonists for the ghrelin receptor could be particularly interesting for the treatment of obesity.',\n",

Using synthetic peptides, LALERKDHSG was identified as an alpha6beta1-binding sequence in thrombospondin-1. This peptide inhibited alpha6beta1-dependent cell adhesion to thrombospondin-1, thrombospondin-2, and the E8 fragment of murine laminin-1. The Glu residue in this peptide was required for activity, and the corresponding residue (Glu90) in the N-terminal module of thrombospondin-1 was required for its recognition by alpha6beta1, but not by alpha4beta1. alpha6beta1 was also expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells; but in these cells, only certain agonists could activate the integrin to recognize thrombospondins. Selective activation of alpha6beta1 integrin in microvascular endothelial cells by the anti-beta1 antibody TS2/16 therefore accounts for their adhesion responses to thrombospondins and explains the distinct functions of alpha4beta1 and alpha6beta1 integrins as thrombospondin receptors in microvascular and large vessel endothelial cells.',\n",

In this study, we combined chemical synthetic approaches with alanine substitution to evaluate the structural requirements for interactions with the APJ receptor. We demonstrated that apelin peptides in aqueous solution adopt a random conformation, and the positive charge and hydrophobic residues of apelin-13 play important roles in interactions with the APJ receptor. We have observed an important correlation between receptor binding affinity and cell-cell fusion inhibitory activity.

A limited number of IHH cases are due to loss-of-function mutations of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. To identify additional gene defects leading to IHH, a large consanguineous family with five affected siblings and with a normal gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor coding sequence was studied. Homozygosity whole-genome mapping allowed the localization of a new locus within the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13). Sequencing of several genes localized within this region showed that all affected siblings of the family carried a homozygous deletion of 155 nucleotides in the GPR54 gene. This deletion encompassed the splicing acceptor site of intron 4-exon 5 junction and part of exon 5. The deletion was absent or present on only one allele in unaffected family members. GPR54 has been initially identified as an orphan G protein-coupled receptor with 40% homology to galanin receptors. Recently, a 54-aa peptide derived from the KiSS1 protein was identified as a ligand of GPR54.

We have utilised the ecdysone-inducible expression system containing the human nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide receptor (hNOP) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOINDhNOP) to examine the activity of a range of partial agonists in receptor binding, GTPgamma35S binding and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase studies.

At 191 fmol mg-1, protein hNOP pharmacology was identical to that reported for other traditional expression systems.

Intrinsic activity of [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 relative to N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 was 0.3-0.5. [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 did not stimulate GTPgamma35S binding at 1 microm PON, but competitively antagonised the effects of N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 with a pKB=7.62.

Studies with GFP-tagged ETB have suggested that the protein is constitutively endocytosed and targeted to lysosomes where it is rapidly degraded. We report that iodinated endothelin-1 ligand (ET-1) is taken up by cells transfected with ETB and remains undegraded for at least 17 h. Analysis of the intracellular traffic of endocytosed ET-1 on isotonic Ficoll gradients shows that it is rapidly internalised to lysosomes by a chloroquine sensitive and cholesterol dependent pathway. Low-temperature nonreducing SDS gels show that the ET-1 initially binds to full-length GFP-tagged ETB, which is rapidly clipped at the amino-terminus and is then stable for at least 6 h. Analysis of GFP tagged ETB on reducing SDS gels shows that it is proteolytically cleaved with a half time of approximately 3 h. However, nonreducing gels show that the receptor is virtually intact, suffering only a similar cleavage to the liganded receptor. We conclude that the ETB receptor shows remarkable stability in lysosomes, held together by disulfide bonds, and maintaining ligand binding for long periods of time.',\n",

Here, we show the role in this process of TAG-1, a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol-anchored cell adhesion molecule. In the absence of TAG-1, axonal Caspr2 did not accumulate at juxtaparanodes, and the normal enrichment of shaker-type K+ channels in these regions was severely disrupted, in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In contrast, the localization of protein 4.1B, an axoplasmic partner of Caspr2, was only moderately altered. TAG-1, which is expressed in both neurons and glia, was able to associate in cis with Caspr2 and in trans with itself. Thus, a tripartite intercellular protein complex, comprised of these two proteins, appears critical for axo-glial contacts at juxtaparanodes. This complex is analogous to that described previously at paranodes, suggesting that similar molecules are crucial for different types of axo-glial interactions.',\n",

Using these receptor preparations, we examined the binding affinities of ANP, BNP, and CNP for the C-receptor and their potencies for cGMP production via the ANP-A receptor (GC-A) and the ANP-B receptor (GC-B). These analyses revealed the presence of a marked species difference in the receptor selectivity of the natriuretic peptide family, especially among BNPs. Therefore, we investigated the receptor selectivity of the natriuretic peptide family using the homologous assay system with endogenous ligands and receptors of the same species. The rank order of binding affinity for the C-receptor was ANP greater than CNP greater than BNP in both humans and rats. The rank order of potency for cGMP production via the ANP-A receptor (GC-A) was ANP greater than or equal to BNP much greater than CNP, but that via the ANP-B receptor (GC-B) was CNP greater than ANP greater than or equal to BNP. These findings on the receptor selectivity of the natriuretic peptide family provide a new insight into the understanding of the physiological and clinical implications of the natriuretic peptide system.',\n",

Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated for both receptors binding to a single population of binding sites, and competition binding studies showed that the binding specificities of the receptors corresponded to those of classical NK1 and NK2 receptors. In contrast, the binding of eledoisin to the NK3 receptor expressed in the transfected CHO cells was of low affinity (IC50 = 240 nM) compared to the high affinity of the receptor found when it was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (IC50 = 8 nM). However, in both cases the receptor exhibited the specificity of a classical NK3 receptor.

The position of intron-exon junctions are identical to those in other reported neurokinin genes. Using a chimeric genomic-cDNA gene, the human NK-3 receptor was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes where it mediates membrane conductance changes in response to its agonist, neurokinin B. More significantly, expression of the gene in mammalian cells resulted in detection of receptor binding as well as neurokinin-stimulated calcium mobilization and arachidonic acid release, all displaying the pharmacological characteristics expected of a neurokinin-3 receptor.

Results demonstrated that both neurons and astrocytes expressed specific RNA for CD137 and its protein, which was found both on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, microglia, which also expressed CD137 mRNA, showed negative immunostaining. CD137-L-specific RNA was detected only in astrocytes and neurons. When brain cells were treated with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), upregulation of CD137 but not of its ligand was observed in neurons and astrocytes. Protein localization was also affected. In microglia, an inhibition of RNA expression was induced by treatment, whereas CD137-L remained negative. Our data are the first demonstration that human brain cells express a protein found thus far in activated immunocompetent cells and epithelia. Moreover, they suggest not only that CD137 and CD137-L might play a role in interaction among human brain cells, but also that FGF-2 might have an immunoregulatory function in brain, modulating interaction of the central nervous system with peripheral immunocompetent cells.',\n",

The encoded receptor is a 388-amino-acid polypeptide with 7 transmembrane domains typical of G protein-coupled receptors. The oxytocin receptor, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, specifically responds to oxytocin and induces an inward membrane current. Messenger RNAs for the receptor are of two sizes, 3.6 kilobases in breast, and 4.4 kilobases in ovary, uterine endometrium and myometrium. The mRNA level in the myometrium is very high at term.

Our immunocytochemical results show thrombomodulin localized to endothelium in heart biopsy specimens before transplantation. This reactivity persists in the absence of cellular rejection, but the infiltration of immune cells is associated with a lack of endothelial thrombomodulin. The second pathway is composed of antithrombin III (ATIII) bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) molecules on endothelial cells. These ATIII-HSPG complexes bind and inactivate thrombin at the endothelial surface. Our immunocytochemical results show ATIII localized to endothelium in heart biopsy specimens before transplantation. This reactivity is present in the absence of vascular rejection as defined by either angiography or microscopy. The absence of thrombomodulin and ATIII is always associated with fibrin deposition within the microcirculation. Thrombomodulin and ATIII pathways appear to be independent, for cellular rejection often is associated with thrombomodulin-negative ATIII-positive endothelium, and vascular rejection often is associated with thrombomodulin-positive ATIII-negative endothelium. Cytokines from activated macrophages down-regulate endothelial thrombomodulin without generally affecting the ATIII-HSPG pathway. Immunosuppressive therapy depletes cytokine-producing cells that affect thrombomodulin, but there presently is no therapy to protect endothelium in vascular rejection. It is possible that heparin could interact with endothelium and bind ATIII to maintain a state of thromboresistance.',\n",

Displacement experiments using peptidic analogs of neurotensin and levocabastine confirmed that the transfected receptor exhibits the binding properties of the neurotensin receptor characterized in the rat brain. Neurotensin stimulated the phosphoinositides hydrolysis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and this effect was mimicked by neurotensin(8-13) and by neuromedin N. The stimulation of phosphoinositides hydrolysis was not inhibited by pertussis toxin. These results indicate that the transfected cells actively express the rat neurotensin receptor which is functionally coupled to phospholipase C through a pertussis toxin-insensitive GTP-binding protein, and that neuromedin N is able to induce the phosphoinositides turnover by interaction with the neurotensin receptor.',\n",

PACAP-38, PACAP-27, VIP, and secretin all caused a threefold increase in pepsinogen release. The dose-response curves of PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP were biphasic, whereas with secretin it was not. The first phase comprised 40% of maximal release, and each of the three peptides (PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP) were equipotent (EC50 0.1-0.3 nM). For the second phase, comprising 60% of maximal release, the relative potencies were PACAP-38 > PACAP-27 = VIP. 125I-labeled secretin, 125I-VIP, and 125I-PACAP-27 all demonstrated saturable binding to chief cells. Binding of both 125I-PACAP-27 and 125I-VIP was inhibited completely and with similar potencies by PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP. Secretin had a > 500-fold lower affinity than PACAP-38 for displacing both 125I-PACAP-27 and 125I-VIP. With 125I-secretin, secretin was the most potent, and was 197 times more potent than PACAP-38, which was 6-8 times more potent than both PACAP-27 and VIP. We conclude that both PACAP-38 and PACAP-27 stimulate pepsinogen secretion from dispersed chief cells. In contrast to a number of other tissues, no evidence for a high-affinity receptor that interacted only with PACAP was found. PACAP and VIP interact with equal high affinity with a common receptor and with low affinity with the secretin receptor.',\n",

Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of a third member of the SSTR family. Human SSTR3 is a protein of 418 amino acids and has 45% and 46% identity with human SSTR1 and SSTR2, respectively. RNA blotting studies showed that SSTR3 mRNA could be readily detected in brain and pancreatic islets.

Studies using cells transiently coexpressing the human dopamine D1 receptor and human SSTR3 showed that somatostatin was able to inhibit dopamine-stimulated cAMP formation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that SSTR3 was functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase.

Somatostatin exerts its biological effects by binding to specific high-affinity receptors, which appear in many cases to be coupled to GTP-binding proteins. Here we report the cloning, functional expression, and tissue distribution of two different somatostatin receptors (SSTRs).

RNA blotting studies show that SSTR1 and SSTR2 are expressed at highest levels in jejunum and stomach and in cerebrum and kidney, respectively. A SSTR1 probe hybridized to multiple DNA fragments in EcoRI digests of human and mouse DNA, indicating that SSTR1 and SSTR2 are members of a larger family of somatostatin receptors.

An endogenous ligand that acts on this guanylate cyclase has not previously been found. To search for a potential endogenous ligand, we utilized T84 cells, a human colon carcinoma-derived cell line, in culture as a bioassay. This cell line selectively responds to the toxin in a very sensitive manner with an increase in intracellular cyclic GMP. In the present study, we describe the purification and structure of a peptide from rat jejunum that activates this enzyme. This peptide, which we have termed guanylin, is composed of 15 amino acids and has the following amino acid sequence, PNTCEICAYAACTGC, as determined by automated Edman degradation sequence analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of this peptide reveals a high degree of homology with heat-stable enterotoxins. Solid-phase synthesis of this peptide confirmed that it stimulates increases in T84 cyclic GMP levels. Guanylin required oxidation for expression of bioactivity and subsequent reduction of the oxidized peptide eliminated the effect on cyclic GMP, indicating a requirement for cysteine disulfide bond formation. Synthetic guanylin also displaces heat-stable enterotoxin binding to cultured T84 cells. Based on these data, we propose that guanylin is an activator of intestinal guanylate cyclase and that it stimulates this enzyme through the same receptor binding region as the heat-stable enterotoxins.',\n",

A promiscuous chemokine receptor, the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), has been implicated in the regulation of chemokine functions. Here we show that DARC is selectively expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in the high endothelial venules (HEV) of unstimulated lymph nodes (LN). To examine the biological significance of DARC expression in HEV, we performed competitive binding experiments with 20 different chemokines. The results showed that DARC selectively bound distinct members of the pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL2, CCL5 and CCL7, but not lymphoid chemokines such as CCL21, CCL19, CXCL12 and CXCL13 that are normally expressed in HEV. CCL2 bound to DARC failed to induce a significant cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation in CCR2B-expressing cells, whereas the free form of CCL2 induced a distinct [Ca(2+)] elevation, suggesting that DARC down-regulates activities of pro-inflammatory chemokines upon binding. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding DARC did not induce any obvious changes in the cell number or leukocyte subsets in the peripheral and mesenteric LN. Neither did DARC deficiency significantly affect lymphocyte migration into LN. These results suggest that DARC may be a scavenger for pro-inflammatory chemokines, but not a presenting molecule for lymphoid chemokines at HEV and that it is probably functionally dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking to HEV-bearing lymphoid tissues under physiological conditions.',\n",

In the solid-phase binding assay utilizing small nitrocellulose discs to immobilize matrix molecules, binding of syndecan to neurite growth-promoting protein, p30/amphoterin, was observed. This binding was strongly dependent on the concentration of amphoterin used to coat the discs, but was saturable with an excess amount of syndecan. The interaction was inhibitable with heparan sulfate and heparin but less effectively with chondroitin sulfate, indicating that heparan sulfate chains of syndecan were involved in the binding. Anti-amphoterin antibodies inhibited the binding partially. Mouse mammary epithelial cells were shown to bind amphoterin directly but not after trypsin treatment or in the presence of heparin and to produce amphoterin in the extracellular space. Both syndecan and amphoterin were found to localize on lateral surfaces of newly adhered mammary epithelial cells. Toward confluency amphoterin amounts decreased. Because amphoterin can be localized to the same sites with syndecan and because of their interaction, amphoterin is a new putative pericellular ligand for syndecan.

We used an anti-peptide antiserum and a novel mAb against the beta 7 subunit to show that TK-1 cells express beta 7 as the only subunit associated with alpha 4. We conclude that beta 7 and beta P are identical. We also show that activated peripheral blood T cells express alpha 4 beta 7. We studied the function of alpha 4 beta 7/alpha 4 beta P in TK-1 cells, which do not express very late antigen (VLA)-4 (alpha 4 beta 1). Cells adhered to intact fibronectin and to a fibronectin fragment containing the CS-1 region, but not to a fragment containing the RGD sequence. Adhesion to fibronectin was inhibited by antibodies to alpha 4, suggesting that alpha 4 beta 7 is a fibronectin receptor. We confirmed that alpha 4 beta 7 binds to the CS-1 region of fibronectin using affinity chromatography. TK-1 cell adhesion to the vascular cell adhesion molecule VCAM-1 was also inhibited by antibodies to alpha 4, implying that alpha 4 beta 7 also plays a role in the adherence of lymphocytes to endothelial cells. TK-1 cell binding to fibronectin and VCAM-1 is markedly increased by brief PMA stimulation. We also found that mAbs against alpha 4 and beta 7 induce homotypic clustering of TK-1 cells. Taken together these results suggest that alpha 4 beta 7/alpha 4 beta P recognizes some or all of the same widely distributed ligands recognized by VLA-4 (alpha 4 beta 1) and that the role of alpha 4 beta 7/alpha 4 beta P may not be restricted to lymphocyte homing.\",\n",

A direct correlation between the degree of binding of RAP to the receptor and the degree of ligand inhibition was observed, indicating that as the RAP binding sites are saturated, alpha 2MR/LRP loses its ability to bind ligands.

We have constructed an expression vector that directs the synthesis of the entire extracellular ligand-binding domain of the Kit/SCF receptor. When expressed and amplified in Chinese hamster ovary cells, a secreted 90-kDa glycoprotein could be harvested from the growth medium of the cells in a soluble form. This extracellular portion of the Kit/SCF receptor, denoted Kit-X, was recognized by antibodies specific to the SCF receptor; and when injected into animals, it raised antibodies that were reactive with the complete membrane form of the receptor. Direct binding and covalent cross-linking of radiolabeled SCF showed that Kit-X fully retained high affinity ligand binding and also underwent efficient dimerization in the presence of the ligand. The capacity of Kit-X to act as an antagonist of SCF was assayed on cultured cells that overexpress the receptor. Simultaneous addition of SCF and Kit-X to these cells resulted in a stoichiometric inhibition of SCF binding and a consequent decrease in autophosphorylation of the SCF receptor on tyrosine residues. The inhibition extended to later SCF-mediated responses, including the association of the receptor with phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and coupling to the Raf1 protein kinase. These results indicate that the recombinant ectodomain of the Kit-SCF receptor can be used as a specific antagonist of SCF actions and may enable detailed molecular analysis of ligand-receptor interactions.\",\n",
       " '1376732': 'A cDNA encoding a unique hyaluronan receptor has been molecularly cloned from a lambda GT11 3T3 cDNA expression library. Immunoblot analyses of cell lysates, using antibodies to peptides encoded in the cDNA, specifically react with a 58-kD protein. This protein is regulated by the mutant H-ras gene in cells containing a metallothionein promoter H-ras hybrid gene. Further, antibodies to peptide sequences encoded in the cDNA block the increase in locomotion resulting from induction of the mutant H-ras gene in this cell line. In a transblot assay, the bacterially expressed protein binds to biotinylated hyaluronan. Antibodies to peptides encoded in the cDNA react in immunoblot assays with the 58- and 52-kD proteins of a novel hyaluronan receptor complex previously implicated in cell locomotion. Furthermore, antibodies specific to the 58- and 52-kD proteins, which block ras-induced locomotion, also cross-react with the expressed, encoded protein. The gene product described here appears to be a new type of hyaluronan receptor that is involved in cell locomotion. It is named RHAMM, an acronym for receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility.',\n",
       " '1377218': 'The human C1q receptor (C1q-R) is a 65-70-kd, highly acidic, hydrophobic glycoprotein that is expressed on a wide variety of cell surfaces. Although the C1q-R itself appears to bind preferentially to C1q, the region of the ligand to which C1q-R binds is the primary binding site for several other molecules, including fibronectin, laminin, and C1q inhibitor (chondroitin 4-sulfate proteoglycan) as well as the complement C1r2C1s2 tetramer. In order to further characterize the C1q-R molecule with regard to its structure and function, highly purified C1q-R was obtained from Raji cells using DEAE-Sephacel and C1q-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography. Studies performed with 125I-labeled C1q-R demonstrated that whereas the C1q-R molecule binds poorly to a variety of human collagens including types II, III, and V, markedly enhanced binding is observed with type IV collagen and moderately enhanced binding with type I collagen. Amino acid composition studies show that the C1q-R molecule contains approximately 44% hydrophobic and 12.6% hydrophilic residues with a ratio of negatively charged to positively charged residues of about 2:1. Treatment of 125I-labeled C1q-R with endoglycosidase F lowers the apparent molecular size from 70 to 58 kd, whereas endoglycosidase H lowered the size to 64 kd. Treatment with neuraminidase, on the other hand, shifted the size of C1q-R to 60 kd. These results suggest the presence of several highly sialylated complex-type or high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Because purified C1q-R has a blocked amino terminus, amino acid sequences representing internal fragments of the molecule were generated by electroblotting and in situ enzymatic digestion. When these short sequences were searched against the National Biomedical Research Foundation computer data base, a seven-amino-acid sequence, VSWQGQI, showed significant homology (100% and 80% in a five-amino-acid overlap, respectively) with the alpha chains of the human fibronectin (alpha 5 beta 1) and vitronectin (alpha v beta 3) receptors, and to a lesser degree with epidermal growth factor receptor and T cell receptor. A second sequence, ISEDNIR, showed homology with mouse collagen type IV (86% in a six-amino-acid overlap), calmodulin (60% in a seven-amino-acid overlap), and a Leishmania major surface antigen, gp63. These observations seem to predict that C1q-R has pockets of conserved sequences that are similar to those not only present in its ligand(s) but also in other cell surface receptors that may, in part, fulfill similar functions.',\n",

In an in vitro binding assay with purified CD58 and CD59, CD2+ cells bind not only immobilized CD58 but also CD59. With two complementary approaches, it was demonstrated that the binding sites on CD2 for CD58 and CD59 are overlapping but nonidentical.

The ligand for ELAM-1 is the sialylated Lewis-x antigen (SLe(x)) structure. The selectin LAM-1 (or LECAM-1) has been described as one of the SLe(x)-presenting glycoproteins involved in neutrophil binding to ELAM-1. Other presenter molecules have not yet been described. Our data demonstrate that the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-like surface molecules on neutrophils--known as the nonspecific cross-reacting antigens (NCAs)--are involved in neutrophil adherence to monolayers of IL-1-beta-activated EC. The NCAs are recognized by CD66 (NCA-160 and NCA-90) and CD67 (NCA-95). Because NCA-95 and NCA-90 have previously been found to be phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) neutrophils (which lack PI-linked surface proteins) were tested as well. PNH neutrophils showed a diminished binding to activated EC. CD66 (on PNH cells still recognizing the transmembrane NCA-160 form) still inhibited the adherence of PNH cells to IL-1-beta-activated EC, but to a limited extent. Soluble CEA(-related) antigens inhibited normal neutrophil adherence as well, whereas neutrophil transmigration was unaffected. Sialidase-treatment as well as CD66 preclearing abolished the inhibitory capacity of the CEA(-related) antigens. The binding of soluble CEA antigens to IL-1-beta-pretreated EC was blocked by anti-ELAM-1. These soluble antigens, as well as the neutrophil NCA-160 and NCA-90, both recognized by CD66 antibodies, presented the SLe(x) determinant. Together, these findings indicate that the CD66 antigens (i.e., NCA-160/NCA-90) function as presenter molecules of the SLe(x) oligosaccharide structures on neutrophils that bind to ELAM-1 on EC.',\n",

Recently, cDNA clones encoding a high affinity IL-8 receptor (IL-8R-A) and a \"low affinity\" IL-8 receptor (IL-8R-B) have been isolated from human cDNA libraries. These two receptors have 77% amino acid identity and are members of the G protein-coupled superfamily of receptors with seven transmembrane domains. We have expressed these two receptors in mammalian cells and find that in this system both receptors bind IL-8 with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The receptor affinities differ for MGSA, however. IL-8R-A binds MGSA with low affinity (Kd approximately 450 nM); IL-8R-B binds MGSA with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The transfected cells respond to ligand binding with a transient increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. A Ca2+ response is found for IL-8R-A following the binding of IL-8; no response is found for MGSA. A Ca2+ response for IL-8R-B follows the binding of both ligands. Blot hybridization with oligonucleotide probes specific for the two receptors shows that mRNA for both receptors is present in human neutrophils. Analysis of IL-8 and MGSA binding data on neutrophils as well as Ca2+ response and desensitization data shows that the presence of these two IL-8 receptors on the cell surface can account for the profile of these two ligands on neutrophils.',\n",

To clarify and confirm the function of CD36 (glycoprotein IV) as a TSP receptor, we now describe a transfected cell model using human melanoma cells genetically manipulated by sense or antisense cDNA transfection to express either high or near zero levels of CD36. Surface expression was confirmed by flow cytometry with monoclonal anti-CD36 IgG and quantified by measuring radiolabeled antibody binding. Bowes melanoma cells, which in their wild type did not express CD36 and did not bind radiolabeled TSP, when transfected with the sense construct bound TSP in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with CD36 expression. Conversely, C32 melanoma cells, which in their wild type expressed high levels of CD36 and bound radiolabeled TSP at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, did not express CD36 and did not bind TSP when transfected with an antisense construct. In addition, transfected Bowes cells and wild type C32 cells, unlike wild type Bowes cells, adhered to activated platelets in a TSP-dependent manner. These data, i.e. the gain of function with sense cDNA transfection and loss of function with antisense transfection, strongly support the TSP receptor function of CD36. The distribution of this protein in vascular cells and tissues and observations that it may participate in signal transduction events suggest that TSP-CD36 interactions may play a role in mediating some of the pathophysiological processes associated with TSP.',\n",

In addition, FGF-6 was found to bind to FGFR-4 in ligand competition experiments. Interestingly, the FGFR-4 gene was found to encode only the prototype receptor in a region where both FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 show alternative splicing leading to differences in their ligand binding specificities and to secreted forms of these receptors. Ligands binding to FGFR-4 induced receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of a set of cellular polypeptides, which differed from those phosphorylated in FGFR-1-expressing cells. Specifically, the FGFR-1-expressing cells showed a considerably more extensive tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma than the FGFR-4-expressing cells. Structural and functional specificity within the FGFR family exemplified by FGFR-4 may help to explain how FGFs perform their diverse functions.',\n",

There is some evidence that CD2 might bind more than a single ligand. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) expressing human CD59 after cDNA transfection (CD59+CHO) form rosettes with human T cells; these rosettes are inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by the CD59 monoclonal antibody (mAb) H19 and by the CD2 mAb O275 known to block natural rosettes, but not by the CD2R mAb D66, a poor rosette blocker. CD2+CHO transfectants form rosettes with human erythrocytes; these rosettes are inhibited by the CD59 mAb H19 in addition to CD2 mAb O275 and CD58 mAb; murine thymoma cells expressing human CD2 form rosettes with CD59+CHO cells that again are blocked by CD59 H19 and by CD2 O275 mAb. In a marked contrast with H19, two others CD59 mAb, YTH 53.1 and MEM 43, which react with a different epitope on CD59, led to a 50%-70% increase of the number of cells forming rosettes. In addition to rosette experiments, the binding of 125I-labeled CD59 molecules to CD2+CHO cells was specifically inhibited by unlabeled CD59 molecule and CD2 mAb. Furthermore, the binding of CD59 molecules to resting T cells induced expression of CD2R epitopes. These results directly show that CD2 binds CD59 and that subtle molecular changes occur upon binding.',\n",

CD23 has pleiotropic roles in the control of lymphocyte behaviour, suggesting that CD23 may interact with another ligand in addition to IgE. To identify such a CD23 ligand, we expressed and purified full-length recombinant CD23, incorporated it into fluorescent liposomes and used these as a probe. We report here that fluorescent liposomes carrying CD23 interact specifically with the cell-surface protein CD21, identified as the receptor for Epstein-Barr virus and the complement receptor-2 on B cells, some T cells and follicular dendritic cells. In addition, fluorescent CD23-liposomes were shown to bind to hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) transfected with CD21 complementary DNA. The interaction between fluorescent CD23-liposomes and B cells or CD21-transfected BHK-21 cells was specifically inhibited by anti-CD21 and anti-CD23 monoclonal antibodies. Western blotting analysis revealed that 14C-labelled liposomes carrying CD23, in contrast to anti-CD21 antibodies, reacted with a subtype of CD21 molecules. Triggering of CD21 either with an anti-CD21 antibody or with recombinant soluble CD23 was shown to increase specifically interleukin-4-induced IgE production from blood mononuclear cells. These results demonstrate that the cell-surface protein CD21 is a ligand for CD23 and that the pairing of these molecules may participate in the control of IgE production.',\n",

In the process of screening a genomic library with these cDNAs to obtain large clones for use in chromosomal localization studies, we isolated an interleukin-8 receptor pseudogene (IL8RP) that bears greatest similarity to IL8R2. Using Southern hybridization analysis of human x rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs with cDNA probes for IL8R1 and IL8R2 and probes from the IL8RP locus, we assigned the three loci to chromosome 2; fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to metaphase chromosome preparations using genomic clones from each locus refined this localization to chromosome 2, band q35, for all three. By virtue of their chromosomal location, IL8R1 and IL8R2 may be considered candidate genes for several human disorders in which the involved locus has been mapped to distal 2q or that are associated with structural abnormalities of this segment, including van der Woude syndrome and the neoplastic diseases rhabdomyosarcoma and uterine leiomyomata. In addition, because this region of chromosome 2q is homologous to proximal mouse chromosome 1 in the segment containing the Lsh-Ity-Bcg locus involved in mediating host resistance to infection with intracellular pathogens, examination for abnormalities of the murine homologues of the IL8R genes should be considered in mice affected by mutations of this locus.',\n",

Expression profiling identified a network of genes that are co-regulated in dysferlinopathic mice. Co-immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy revealed that dysferlin normally associates with both annexins A1 and A2 in a Ca2+ and membrane injury-dependent manner. The distribution of the annexins and the efficiency of sarcolemmal wound-healing are significantly disrupted in dysferlin-deficient muscle.

       " '14507735': \"The firm arrest of leukocytes to the endothelium during inflammation is known to be mediated by endothelial intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) binding to activated integrins displayed on leukocyte surface. Selectin-ligand interactions, which mediate rolling, are believed to be important for facilitating firm adhesion, either by activating integrins or by facilitating the transition to firm adhesion by making it easier for integrins to bind. Although leukocytes employ two distinct adhesion molecules that mediate different states of adhesion, the fundamental biophysical mechanisms by which two pairs of adhesion molecules facilitate cell adhesion is not well understood. In this work, we attempt to understand the interaction between two molecular systems using a cell-free system in which polystyrene microspheres functionalized with the selectin ligand, sialyl Lewis(X) (sLe(X)), and an antibody against ICAM-1, aICAM-1, are perfused over P-selectin/ICAM-1 coated surfaces in a parallel plate flow chamber. Separately, sLe(X)/P-selectin interactions support rolling and aICAM-1/ICAM-1 interactions mediate firm adhesion. Our results show that sLe(X)/aICAM-1 microspheres will firmly adhere to P-selectin/ICAM-1 coated surfaces, and that the extent of firm adhesion of microspheres is dependent on wall shear stress within the flow chamber, sLe(X)/aICAM-1 microsphere site density, and P-selectin/ICAM-1 surface density ratio. We show that P-selectin's interaction with sLe(X) mechanistically facilitates firm adhesion mediated by antibody binding to ICAM-1: the extent of firm adhesion for the same concentration of aICAM-1/ICAM-1 interaction is greater when sLe(X)/P-selectin interactions are present. aICAM-1/ICAM-1 interactions also stabilize rolling by increasing pause times and decreasing average rolling velocities. Although aICAM-1 is a surrogate for beta(2)-integrin, the kinetics of association between aICAM-1 and ICAM-1 is within a factor of 1.5 of activated integrin binding ICAM-1, suggesting the findings from this model system may be insightful to the mechanism of leukocyte firm adhesion. In particular, these experimental results show how two molecule systems can interact to produce an effect not achievable by either system alone, a fundamental mechanism that may pervade leukocyte adhesion biology.\",\n",

Unlike other NKG2D ligands, Letal mRNA expression progressively decreased after treatment of tumor cells with retinoic acid. Simultaneous T-cell receptor activation and engagement of Letal stimulated proliferation of CD8(+) cells and dramatically increased IL-2 and IFNgamma secretion.

Molecular modeling studies of the extracellular domain of RET (RETECD) have revealed the existence of four cadherin-like domains (CLD1-4) followed by a cysteine-rich domain. Cross-linking experiments have indicated that the RETECD makes direct contacts with both the GDNF ligand and GFR alpha 1 molecule in the complex, although it has low or no detectable affinity for either component alone. We have exploited sequence and functional divergences between the ectodomains of mammalian and amphibian RET molecules to map binding determinants in the human RETECD responsible for its interaction with the GDNF-GFR alpha 1 complex by homologue-scanning mutagenesis. We found that Xenopus RETECD was unable to bind to GDNF-GFR alpha-1 or neurturin (NTN)-GFR alpha-2 complexes of mammalian origin. However, a chimeric molecule containing CLD1, -2, and -3 from human RETECD, but neither domain alone, had similar binding activity as compared with wild type human RETECD, suggesting the existence of an extended ligand binding surface within the three N-terminal cadherin-like domains of human RETECD. Subsequent loss-of-function experiments at higher resolution identified three small subsets of residues, mapping on the same face of the molecular model of RET CLD1, that were required for the interaction of human RETECD with the GDNF-GFR alpha 1 complex. Additional experiments demonstrated that N-linked glycosylation of human RETECD was not required for ligand binding.

Involvement of PDGF-B and PDGF-Rbeta in the initiation and progression of renal fibrosis has been well documented. The authors studied the localization of PDGF ligands and receptors by immunohistochemistry, with emphasis on the role of PDGF-D in murine renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In mice with UUO, de novo expression of PDGF-D was detected in interstitial cells at day 4, which increased to maximal expression at day 14. Increased expression of PDGF-B by interstitial cells and in some tubules was observed after day 4. The diseased mice did not show augmentation of PDGF-A or PDGF-C proteins in the areas of fibrosis. PDGF-Ralpha and -Rbeta protein expression was increased in interstitial cells after day 4 and reached maximal expression at day 14. Human renal nephrectomies (n = 10) of chronic obstructive nephropathy demonstrated similar de novo expression of PDGF-D in interstitial cells, correlating with expression of PDGF-Rbeta and PDGF-B, as it did in the murine model. These observations suggest that PDGF-D plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial injury through binding of PDGF-Rbeta in both human obstructive nephropathy and the corresponding murine model of UUO.',\n",

Analysis of possible receptors related to GPCR135 revealed a single orphan receptor, GPCR142. Thus, we tested whether GPCR142 could also respond to relaxin-3 or related insulin-like molecules. Surprisingly, GPCR142 was activated by nanomolar concentrations of relaxin-3 but was completely unresponsive to all other known insulin-like peptides. We evaluated by reverse transcriptase-PCR the expression of GPCR142 mRNA in a variety of human tissues and found expression in brain, kidney, testis, thymus, placenta, prostate, salivary gland, thyroid, and colon. In an analysis of other species, we were able to find a full-length mouse homolog of GPCR142, but were unable to detect any complete GPCR142 transcripts in rat. With respect to intracellular signaling, GPCR142 is similar to GPCR135 in that it potently inhibits adenylate cyclase and stimulates 35S-GTPgammaS incorporation in response to relaxin-3. However, whereas GPCR135 signaling could be converted to calcium mobilization using a Gqi5 or Galpha16 G-proteins, GPCR142 was only capable of functioning in the presence of Galpha16. In the accompanying article (Liu, C., Eriste, E., Sutton, S., Chen, J., Roland, B., Kuei, C., Farmer, N., JÃ¶rnvall, H., Sillard, R., and Lovenberg, T. W. (2003) J. Biol.

Multiple rounds of extraction, purification, followed by N-terminal sequence analysis of the ligand from porcine brain revealed that the ligand is a product of the recently identified gene, relaxin-3 (aka insulin-7 or INSL7). Recombinant human relaxin-3 potently stimulates GTPgammaS binding and inhibits cAMP accumulation in GPCR135 overexpressing cells with EC50 values of 0.25 and 0.35 nM, respectively. 125I-Relaxin-3 binds GPCR135 at high affinity with a Kd value of 0.31 nM. Relaxin-3 is the only member of the insulin/relaxin superfamily that can activate GPCR135. In situ hybridization showed that relaxin-3 mRNA is predominantly expressed in the dorsomedial ventral tegmental nucleus of the brainstem (aka nucleus incertus), as well as in discrete cells in the lateral periaqueductal gray and in the central gray nucleus. GPCR135 is expressed abundantly in the hypothalamus with discrete expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and supraoptic nucleus, as well as in the cortex, septal nucleus, and preoptical area. Relaxin-3 has previously been shown to bind and activate the LGR7 relaxin receptor.

The extracellular domain of functional neuroligin-1 associates as a dimer when analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium. By surface plasmon resonance, we established that soluble neuroligins-1 bind neurexin-1beta, but the homologous alpha/beta-hydrolase fold protein, acetylcholinesterase, failed to associate with the neurexins. Neuroligin-1 has a unique N-linked glycosylation pattern in the neuroligin family, and glycosylation and its processing modify neuroligin activity. Incomplete processing of the protein and enzymatic removal of the oligosaccharides chain or the terminal sialic acids from neuroligin-1 enhance its activity, whereas deglycosylation of neurexin-1beta did not alter its association capacity. In particular, the N-linked glycosylation at position 303 appears to be a major determinant in modifying the association with neurexin-1beta. We show here that glycosylation processing of neuroligin, in addition to mRNA splicing and gene selection, contributes to the specificity of the neurexin-beta/neuroligin-1 association.',\n",

The stable expression of GPR100 in Chinese hamster ovary cells together with aequorin as calcium sensor and the promiscuous G-protein subunit alpha16 as signal transducer revealed bradykinin and kallidin as effectors to elicit a calcium response. Dose-response curves yielded EC50 values for both ligands in the low nanomolar range, while the respective analogues without arginine at the carboxy-terminus were inactive.

Activation of chemerin receptor results in intracellular calcium release, inhibition of cAMP accumulation, and phosphorylation of p42-p44 MAP kinases, through the Gi class of heterotrimeric G proteins. Chemerin is structurally and evolutionary related to the cathelicidin precursors (antibacterial peptides), cystatins (cysteine protease inhibitors), and kininogens. Chemerin was shown to promote calcium mobilization and chemotaxis of immature DCs and macrophages in a ChemR23-dependent manner. Therefore, chemerin appears as a potent chemoattractant protein of a novel class, which requires proteolytic activation and is specific for APCs.',\n",
       " '14530377': 'The firm adhesion and transplatelet migration of leukocytes on vascular thrombus are dependent on the interaction of the leukocyte integrin Mac-1 (alphaMbeta2, CD11b/CD18) and the platelet counter receptor glycoprotein (GP) Ibalpha. Previous studies have established a central role for the I domain, a stretch of approximately 200 amino acids within the alphaM subunit, in the binding of GP Ibalpha. This study was undertaken to establish the molecular basis of GP Ibalpha recognition by alphaMbeta2. The P201-K217 sequence, which spans an exposed loop and amphipathic alpha4 helix in the three-dimensional structure of the alphaMI domain, was identified as the binding site for GP Ibalpha. Mutant cell lines in which the alphaMI domain segments P201-G207 and R208-K217 were switched to the homologous, but non-GP Ibalpha binding, alphaL domain segments failed to support adhesion to GP Ibalpha. Mutation of amino acid residues within P201-K217, H210-A212, T213-I215, and R216-K217 resulted in the loss of the binding function of the recombinant alphaMI domains to GP Ibalpha. Synthetic peptides duplicating the P201-K217, but not scrambled versions, directly bound GP Ibalpha and inhibited alphaMbeta2-dependent adhesion to GP Ibalpha and adherent platelets. Finally, grafting critical amino acids within the P201-K217 sequence onto alphaL, converted alphaLbeta2 into a GP Ibalpha binding integrin. Thus, the P201-K217 sequence within the alphaMI domain is necessary and sufficient for GP Ibalpha binding. These observations provide a molecular target for disrupting leukocyte-platelet complexes that promote vascular inflammation in thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and angioplasty-related restenosis.',\n",

We provide evidence that SP-A and SP-D act in a dual manner, to enhance or suppress inflammatory mediator production depending on binding orientation. SP-A and SP-D bind SIRPalpha through their globular heads to initiate a signaling pathway that blocks proinflammatory mediator production. In contrast, their collagenous tails stimulate proinflammatory mediator production through binding to calreticulin/CD91. Together a model is implied in which SP-A and SP-D help maintain a non/anti-inflammatory lung environment by stimulating SIRPalpha on resident cells through their globular heads. However, interaction of these heads with PAMPs on foreign organisms or damaged cells and presentation of the collagenous tails in an aggregated state to calreticulin/CD91, stimulates phagocytosis and proinflammatory responses.',\n",

While rat and mouse orthologs of UII precursor protein have been reported, only the tentative structures of UII peptides of these animals have been demonstrated, since prepro-UII proteins lack typical processing sites for their mature peptides. In the present study, we isolated a novel peptide, UII-related peptide (URP), from the extract of the rat brain as the sole immunoreactive substance to anti-UII antibody; the amino acid sequence of the peptide was determined as ACFWKYCV. cDNAs encoding rat, mouse, and human precursor proteins for URP were cloned and revealed that the sequences of mouse and human URP peptides are the same as that for rat URP. Prepro-URP gene is expressed in several rat tissues such as those of the thymus, spleen, testis, and spinal cord, although with lower levels than the prepro-UII gene. In the human, the prepro-URP gene is expressed comparably to prepro-UII in several tissues except the spinal cord. URP was found to bind and activate the human or rat UII receptors (GPR14) and showed a hypotensive effect when administered to anesthetized rats. These results suggest that URP is the endogenous and functional ligand for UII receptor in the rat and mouse, and possibly in the human. We also describe the preparation of specific monoclonal antibodies raised against UII peptide and the establishment of a highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay system for UII peptides.',\n",

Here we investigated the molecular basis of the interactions between galectin-1 and SMCs. Galectin-1 modulated SMC attachment in a dose- and beta-galactoside-dependent manner. Direct binding of galectin-1 to beta1 integrin was detected by the immune precipitation of beta1 integrin after chemical cross-linking of 125I-labelled galectin-1 to the cell surface proteins. Galectin-1 transiently increased availability of beta1 integrins on the cell surface to antibodies against beta1 integrin. Incubation of SMCs with galectin-1 transiently increased the amount of the active form of beta1 integrin and tyrosine phosphorylation of two cytoskeleton-associated proteins; one of them coincided with focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Galectin-1 is likely to affect SMC adhesion by interacting with beta1 integrin on the cell surface of SMCs and inducing outside-in signalling.',\n",

Characteristic of these receptors is a cytokine receptor homology region consisting of two such fibronectin domains defined by a set of four conserved cysteines and a tryptophan-serine-X-tryptophan-serine sequence motif. On target cells, interleukin-6 first binds to its specific receptor and subsequently to a homodimer of the signal transducer protein gp130. The interleukin-6 receptor consists of three extracellular domains. The N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain is not involved in ligand binding, whereas the third membrane proximal fibronectin-like domain accounts for more than 90% of the binding energy to IL-6. Here, the key residues of this fibronectin-like domain involved in the interaction with IL-6 are described. Chemical shift mapping data with 15N-labeled IL-6R-D3 and unlabeled IL-6 coupled with recent structural data clearly reveal the epitope within the IL-6R-D3 responsible for mediating the high affinity interaction with its cognate cytokine.',\n",

Here we show that one of its possible functions is to transport cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to lipoprotein particles by a process involving PLTP interactions with cellular ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). When ABCA1 was induced in murine macrophages or ABCA1-transfected baby hamster kidney cells, PLTP gained the ability to promote cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from cells. Although PLTP alone had lipid efflux activity, its maximum activity was observed in the presence of high density lipoprotein particles. Pulsechase studies showed that the interaction of PLTP with ABCA1-expressing cells played a role in promoting lipid efflux. Overexpression of ABCA1 dramatically increased binding of both PLTP and apoA-I to common sites on the cell surface. Both PLTP and apoA-I were covalently cross-linked to ABCA1, each protein blocked cross-linking of the other, and both PLTP and apoA-I stabilized ABCA1 protein. These results are consistent with PLTP and apoA-I binding to ABCA1 at the same or closely related sites. Thus, PLTP mimics apolipoproteins in removing cellular lipids by the ABCA1 pathway, except that PLTP acts more as an intermediary in the transfer of cellular lipids to lipoprotein particles.',\n",

Increasing evidence suggests that, in addition to the inhibitory Jagged1/Notch1 signaling cascade, other pathways act via Notch to mediate oligodendrocyte differentiation. The GPI-linked neural cell recognition molecule F3/contactin is clustered during development at the paranodal region, a vital site for axoglial interaction. Here, we show that F3/contactin acts as a functional ligand of Notch. This trans-extracellular interaction triggers gamma-secretase-dependent nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain. F3/Notch signaling promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and upregulates the myelin-related protein MAG in OLN-93 cells. This can be blocked by dominant negative Notch1, Notch2, and two Deltex1 mutants lacking the RING-H2 finger motif, but not by dominant-negative RBP-J or Hes1 antisense oligonucleotides. Expression of constitutively active Notch1 or Notch2 does not upregulate MAG. Thus, F3/contactin specifically initiates a Notch/Deltex1 signaling pathway that promotes oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination.',\n",

It is the most heavily glycosylated plasma protein, containing 13 definitively identified glycosylation sites as well as an additional 7 potential glycosylation sites. C1INH consists of two distinct domains: a serpin domain and an amino-terminal domain. The serpin domain retains all the protease-inhibitory function, while the amino-terminal domain bears most of the glycosylation sites. The present studies test the hypothesis that plasma C1INH bears sialyl Lewis(x)-related moieties and therefore binds to selectin adhesion molecules. We demonstrated that plasma C1INH does express sialyl Lewis(x)-related moieties on its N-glycan as detected using mAb HECA-452 and CSLEX1. The data also show that plasma C1INH can bind to P- and E-selectins by FACS and immunoprecipitation experiments. In a tissue culture model of endothelial-leukocyte adhesion, C1INH showed inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. Significant inhibition (>50%) was achieved at a concentration of 250 micro g/ml or higher. This discovery may suggest that C1INH plays a role in the endothelial-leukocyte interaction during inflammation. It may also provide another example of the multifaceted anti-inflammatory effects of C1INH in various animal models and human diseases.',\n",

Both ligands and soluble receptors were found to be monomeric in solution; homo- or heterodimers are not formed even at elevated concentrations. Under native conditions, both IL-19 and IL-20 form stable ternary 1:1:1 complexes with the sIL-20R1 and sIL20R2 receptors, as well as high-affinity binary complexes with sIL-20R2. Unexpectedly, sIL-20R1 does not bind on its own to either IL-19 or IL-20. Thus, one of the possible consecutive mechanisms of formation of the signaling ternary complex may involve two steps: first, the ligand binds to receptor II, creating a high-affinity binding site for the receptor I, and only then does receptor I complete the complex.',\n",
       " '14585398': 'Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a cysteine-rich, extracellular matrix-associated heparin-binding protein implicated in a variety of fibrotic disorders. CTGF is initially synthesized as a mosaic protein containing four discrete structural modules (CTGF(1-4)) but this is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage yielding isoforms comprising modules 3 and 4 (CTGF(3-4)) or module 4 alone (CTGF(4)). In this study, we show that cultured rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) produce CTGF(1-4) and CTGF(3-4) following treatment with transforming growth factor-beta and that CTGF is a cell adhesion factor for activated HSCs. Low density lipoprotein receptor-associated protein (LRP) is a receptor for CTGF(1-4) or CTGF(3-4), but not CTGF(4), whereas cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are binding sites for all CTGF isoforms. Prior occupancy of LRP with other LRP ligands, receptor associated protein, anti-LRP, or a thrombospondin type I peptide (TEWSACSKTCG) resulted in a 50% decrease in the adhesion of activated HSCs to CTGF(1-4) or CTGF(3-4) whereas there was no effect on CTGF(4)-mediated adhesion. Co-incubation of CTGF with heparin or perturbation of cell surface HSPGs with heparinase or sodium chlorate completely blocked adhesion of activated HSCs to all CTGF isoforms. Freshly isolated HSCs demonstrated only weak binding to CTGF but strong binding to fibronectin. Thus HSC adhesion is at least partially promoted by CTGF through its binding to LRP, a process that is heparin-dependent. CTGF-LRP interactions are likely mediated by module 3 and CTGF-heparin interactions occur principally in module 4, although additional motifs may account for the heparin-dependency of LRP binding. These data show that LRP and HSPGs are utilized by HSCs for binding to CTGF and suggest that these cell surface molecules may be involved in mediating CTGF activity or adhesive signaling during the activation process.',\n",

Binding persisted even after phosphatidylinositol- specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) removal of GPI-linked F3 from the cell surface, suggesting a direct interaction between Nogo-66 and Caspr. Both Nogo-A and Caspr co-immunoprecipitated with Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, and the developmental expression pattern of both paralleled compared with Kv1.1, implicating a transient interaction between Nogo-A-Caspr and K(+) channels at early stages of myelination. In pathological models that display paranodal junctional defects (EAE rats, and Shiverer and CGT(-/-) mice), distances between the paired labeling of K(+) channels were shortened significantly and their localization shifted toward paranodes, while paranodal Nogo-A congregation was markedly reduced. Our results demonstrate that Nogo-A interacts in trans with axonal Caspr at CNS paranodes, an interaction that may have a role in modulating axon-glial junction architecture and possibly K(+)-channel localization during development.',\n",

Whereas netrin-G1 is expressed highly in mouse thalamic axons, NGL-1 is most abundant in the striatum and the cerebral cortex--the intermediate and final targets, respectively, of thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Surface-bound NGL-1 stimulates, but soluble NGL-1 disrupts, the growth of embryonic thalamic axons, and in vitro data indicate that NGL-1 activity may be mediated at least partially by netrin-G1.

Mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing confirmed the identity of each fragment at purified yields of several milligrams per liter. Despite the large number of disulfide linkages and glycosylation sites in each LDL receptor homology region (sLRP), all were shown to be competent for binding to several LRP1 ligands. Each sLRP also bound human RAP, which is thought to be a generalized receptor antagonist, in solution-binding experiments. As expected, sLRP2 bound the receptor-binding domain of alpha(2)-macroglobulin (residues 1304-1451). All three sLRPs bound human apolipoprotein-enriched beta very low density lipoprotein, the canonical ligand for this receptor. All three sLRPs also bound lactoferrin and thrombin-protease nexin 1 complexes. Only sLRP4 bound thrombin-antithrombin III complexes. The results show that binding-competent LDL receptor homology regions (sLRPs) can be produced in high yield in P. pastoris and readily purified.

Recently, using ICOS-deficient mice, we have examined the roles of ICOS in immune responses. ICOS is required for humoral immunity. In organ-specific autoimmune responses, however, ICOS has contrast roles in different disease models. On the one hand, ICOS-/- mice exhibited extreme sensitivity to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); on the other, ICOS gene deletion led to complete resistance to collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice.

Expression of the messengers coding these isoforms, compared with that of previously described V28 messengers, is lower in monocytes and NK cells, but higher in CD4(+) T lymphocytes. CX3CR1 and its extended isoforms were expressed in HEK-293 cells and compared for expression, ligand binding, and cellular responses. In steady state experiments, all three CX3CR1 isoforms bound CX3CL1 with similar affinity. In kinetic binding studies, however, k(on) and k(off) were significantly greater for the extended CX3CR1 isoforms, thereby suggesting that the N-terminal extensions may alter the functions induced by CX3CL1. In signaling studies, all three CX3CR1 isoforms mediated agonist-dependent calcium mobilization, but the EC(50) was lower for the extended than for the standard isoforms. In addition, chemotactic responses for these extended isoforms shifted left, also indicating a more sensitive response. Finally, the longer variants appeared to be more potent HIV coreceptors when tested in fusion and infection assays. In conclusion, we identified and characterized functionally two novel isoforms of CX3CR1 that respond more sensitively to CX3CL1 and HIV viral envelopes. These data reveal new complexity in CX3CR1 cell activation and confirm the critical role of the N-terminal domain of the chemokine receptors in ligand recognition and cellular response.',\n",

P., Jr., Hudson, B. G., and Brooks, P. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 8051-8061). The recombinant alpha3NC1 domain contained a RGD site as part of a short collagenous sequence at the N terminus, designated herein as RGD-alpha3NC1. Others, using synthetic peptides, have concluded that this RGD site is nonfunctional in cell adhesion, and therefore, the anti-angiogenic activity is attributed exclusively to alpha(v)beta(3) integrin interactions with non-RGD motifs of the RGD-alpha3NC1 domain (Maeshima, Y., Colorado, P. C., and Kalluri, R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 23745-23750). This nonfunctionality is surprising given that RGD is a binding site for alpha(v)beta(3) integrin in several proteins. In the present study, we used the alpha3NC1 domain with or without the RGD site, expressed in HEK 293 cells for native conformation, as an alternative approach to synthetic peptides to assess the functionality of the RGD site and non-RGD motifs. Our results demonstrate a predominant role of the RGD site for endothelial adhesion and for binding of alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(v)beta(5) integrins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the two non-RGD peptides, previously identified as the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-binding sites of the alpha3NC1 domain, are 10-fold less potent in competing for integrin binding than the native protein, indicating the importance of additional structural and/or conformational features of the alpha3NC1 domain for integrin binding. Therefore, the RGD site, in addition to non-RGD motifs, may contribute to the mechanisms of endothelial cell adhesion in the human vasculature and the anti-angiogenic activity of the RGD-alpha3NC1 domain.',\n",

Calcitonin is essential for calcium balance, whereas CGRP and ADM are important for neurotransmission and cardiovascular and respiratory regulation. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we identified intermedin as a novel member of the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family. Analysis of intermedin expression indicated that intermedin is expressed primarily in the pituitary and gastrointestinal tract. Intermedin increased cAMP production in SK-N-MC and L6 cells expressing endogenous CGRP receptors and competed with labeled CGRP for binding to its receptors in these cells. In addition, treatment of 293T cells expressing recombinant calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and one of the three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) showed that a CRLR/RAMP receptor complex is required for intermedin signaling. In contrast to CGRP and ADM, which exhibited a preferential stimulation of CRLR when co-expressed with RAMP1 and RAMP2 or RAMP3, respectively, intermedin represents a nonselective agonist for the RAMP coreceptors. In vivo studies demonstrated that intermedin treatment led to blood pressure reduction in both normal and spontaneously hypertensive rats via interactions with the CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes. Furthermore, in vivo treatment in mice with intermedin led to suppression of gastric emptying activity and food intake. Thus, identification of intermedin as a novel member of the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family capable of signaling through CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes provides an additional player in the regulation of peripheral tissues by CRLR and will allow development of new therapeutic agents for pathologies associated with diverse vascular and gastrointestinal disorders.',\n",

In an animal model of thioglycollate-induced acute peritonitis, leukocyte recruitment was significantly impaired in RAGE-deficient mice as opposed to wild-type mice. In diabetic wild-type mice we observed enhanced leukocyte recruitment to the inflamed peritoneum as compared with nondiabetic wild-type mice; this phenomenon was attributed to RAGE as it was abrogated in the presence of soluble RAGE and was absent in diabetic RAGE-deficient mice. In vitro, RAGE-dependent leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells was mediated by a direct interaction of RAGE with the beta2-integrin Mac-1 and, to a lower extent, with p150,95 but not with LFA-1 or with beta1-integrins. The RAGE-Mac-1 interaction was augmented by the proinflammatory RAGE-ligand, S100-protein. These results were corroborated by analysis of cells transfected with different heterodimeric beta2-integrins, by using RAGE-transfected cells, and by using purified proteins. The RAGE-Mac-1 interaction defines a novel pathway of leukocyte recruitment relevant in inflammatory disorders associated with increased RAGE expression, such as in diabetes, and could provide the basis for the development of novel therapeutic applications.',\n",

However, it is not known whether ASMC express CXCR6, the receptor for CXCL16, or whether CXCL16 affects ASMC biology. To dissect the biological and signal transduction pathways elicited by CXCL16, human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were treated with pharmacological inhibitors or transiently transfected with pathway-specific dominant-negative or kinase-dead expression vectors prior to the addition of CXCL16. HASMC expressed CXCR6 at basal conditions. Exposure of HASMC to CXCL16 increased NF-kappa B DNA binding activity, induced kappa B-driven luciferase activity, and up-regulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in an NF-kappa B-dependent manner. However, treatment with pertussis toxin (G(i) inhibitor), wortmannin or LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K inhibitors)), or Akt inhibitor or overexpression of dominant-negative (dn) PI3K gamma, dnPDK-1, kinase-dead (kd) Akt, kdIKK-beta, dnIKK-gamma, dnI kappa B-alpha, or dnI kappa B-beta significantly attenuated CXCL16-induced NF-kappa B activation.

In conclusion, CXCL16 is a potent and direct activator of NF-kappaB and induces kappa B-dependent proinflammatory gene transcription. CXCL16-mediated NF-kappa B activation occurred via heterotrimeric G proteins, PI3K, PDK-1, Akt, and I kappa B kinase (IKK). CXCL16 induced I kappa B phosphorylation and degradation. Most importantly, CXCL16 increased cell-cell adhesion and induced kappa B-dependent ASMC proliferation, indicating that CXCL16 may play an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease.',\n",

To identify mechanisms underlying glioblastoma invasion and motility, we used Transwell invasion chambers to select for a more potently invasive subpopulation of U87MG human glioblastoma cells. The stable population of tumor cells (U87-C1) obtained through this in vitro selection process were three times more invasive than parental U87MG cells and demonstrated faster monolayer wound healing and enhanced radial motility from cell spheroids. This enhanced invasiveness was associated with an 80% increase in matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) activation. No differences in expression levels of pro-MMP-2, membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase I (MT1-MMP), or integrin alphavbeta3 (mediators of MMP-2 activation) were detected. However, U87-C1 cells exhibited two-fold elevation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2 mRNA and protein relative to parental cells. Exogenous addition of comparable levels of purified TIMP-2 to parental U87MG cells increased MMP-2 activation and invasion. Similarly, U87MG cells engineered to overexpress TIMP-2 at the same levels as U87-C1 cells also demonstrated increased MMP-2 activation, indicating that an increase in physiological levels of TIMP-2 can promote MMP-2 activation and invasion in glioblastoma cells. However, exogenous administration or recombinant overexpression of higher amounts of TIMP-2 in U87MG cells resulted in inhibition of MMP-2 activation. These results demonstrate that the complex balance between TIMP-2 and MMP-2 is a critical determinant of glioblastoma invasion, and indicate that increasing TIMP-2 in glioblastoma patients may potentially cause adverse effects, particularly in tumors containing high levels of MT1-MMP and MMP-2.',\n",

Whether RANTES uses proteoglycans (PGs) belonging to the syndecan family to attach to primary cells expressing RANTES G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) was investigated. We demonstrate that RANTES specifically binds to high and low affinity binding sites on human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). We show by co-immunoprecipitation experiments that RANTES is associated on these cells with syndecan-1 and syndecan-4, but neither with syndecan-2 nor with betaglycan, in addition to CD44 and its GPCRs, CCR5 and CCR1. Glycosaminidases pre-treatment of the monocyte derived-macrophages strongly decreases the binding of RANTES to syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 and also to CCR5, and abolishes RANTES binding to CD44. This suggests that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are involved in RANTES binding to the PGs and that such bindings facilitate the subsequent interaction of RANTES with CCR5, on the MDM, characterized by low membrane expression of CCR5. The role of these interactions in the pathophysiology of RANTES deserves further study.',\n",

We also show that both LRP and gp330 bind an additional ligand, bovine lactoferrin, which is known to inhibit the hepatic clearance of chylomicron remnants. Lactoferrin blocked the LRP-dependent stimulation of cholesteryl ester synthesis in cultured human fibroblasts elicited by apoprotein E-beta-VLDL or lipoprotein lipase-beta-VLDL complexes. Cross-competition experiments in fibroblasts showed that the multiple ligands recognize at least three distinct, but partially overlapping sites on the LRP molecule. Binding of all ligands to LRP and gp330 was inhibited by the 39-kDa protein, which co-purifies with the two receptors, suggesting that the 39-kDa protein is a universal regulator of ligand binding to both receptors. The correlation of the inhibitory effects of lactoferrin in vivo and in vitro support the notion that LRP functions as a chylomicron remnant receptor in liver. LRP and gp330 share a multiplicity of binding sites, and both may function as endocytosis-mediating receptors for a large number of ligands in different organs.',\n",

Components of the AMH signaling pathway have been identified in gonads and gonadal cell lines. The AMH type II receptor is highly specific. In contrast, the identity of the AMH type I receptor is not clear; three type I receptors of Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), Alk2, Alk3 and Alk6 may transduce AMH signals, but none of them has all the characteristics of an AMH type I receptor.

Results of previous studies from our laboratory and others suggest that vascular sensitivity to CGRP is enhanced during pregnancy and that the female sex steroid hormones estradiol-17beta (E2) and progesterone (P4) may be involved in this process. We hypothesized that CGRP receptors in the mesenteric artery are increased during pregnancy and with sex steroid hormone treatments. In the present study, we investigated whether pregnancy and female sex steroid hormones modulate the CGRP-receptors CGRP-A and CGRP-B in the mesenteric artery in the rat. The CGRP-A receptor consists of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1); however, the CGRP-B receptor needs to be further characterized. Messenger RNA levels for CRLR and RAMP1 were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and CGRP-B receptor proteins levels were determined by Western blot analysis. In addition, [125I]CGRP binding was measured by Scatchard analysis. Both mRNA for CGRP-A (CRLR and RAMP1) and the protein for CGRP-B receptors in mesenteric arteries were increased with pregnancy compared to nonpregnant, diestrous animals. A P4 antagonist, RU-486, downregulated and P4 upregulated these receptors in mesenteric arteries (P < 0.05) in pregnant rats. In adult ovariectomized rats, P4 upregulated CRLR and RAMP1 mRNA levels as well as [125I]CGRP-binding sites. The CGRP-B-receptor protein levels were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated by P4 and by combined E2 and P4 treatment. Together with earlier findings, these data suggest that increases in the expression of CGRP-A (CRLR and RAMP1) and CGRP-B receptors in mesenteric arteries may be important in reducing vascular resistance and in vascular adaptations that occur during pregnancy; in addition, P4 may be involved in this process.',\n",

GDF-9 is indispensable for the development of ovarian follicles from the primary stage, and treatment with GDF-9 enhances the progression of early follicles into small preantral follicles. Similar to other TGF-beta family ligands, GDF-9 likely initiates signaling mediated by type I and type II receptors with serine/threonine kinase activity, followed by the phosphorylation of intracellular transcription factors named Smads. We have shown previously that GDF-9 interacts with the BMP type II receptor (BMPRII) in granulosa cells, but the type I receptor involved is unknown. Using P19 cells, we now report that GDF-9 treatment stimulated the CAGA-luciferase reporter known to be responsive to TGF-beta mediated by the type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)5. In contrast, GDF-9 did not stimulate BMP-responsive reporters. In addition, treatment with GDF-9 induced the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in P19 cells, and the stimulatory effect of GDF-9 on the CAGA-luciferase reporter was blocked by the inhibitory Smad7, but not Smad6. We further reconstructed the GDF-9 signaling pathway using Cos7 cells that are not responsive to GDF-9. After overexpression of ALK5, with or without exogenous Smad3, the Cos7 cells gained GDF-9 responsiveness based on the CAGA-luciferase reporter assay. The roles of ALK5 and downstream pathway genes in mediating GDF-9 actions were further tested in ovarian cells. In cultured rat granulosa cells from early antral follicles, treatment with GDF-9 stimulated the CAGA-luciferase reporter activity and induced the phosphorylation of Smad3. Furthermore, transfection with small interfering RNA for ALK5 or overexpression of the inhibitory Smad7 resulted in dose-dependent suppression of GDF-9 actions. In conclusion, although GDF-9 binds to the BMP-activated type II receptor, its downstream actions are mediated by the type I receptor, ALK5, and the Smad2 and Smad3 proteins. Because ALK5 is a known receptor for TGF-beta, diverse members of the TGF-beta family of ligands appear to interact with a limited number of receptors in a combinatorial manner to activate two downstream Smad pathways.',\n",

Although both interactions have similar K(D)s, TM binding is rapid and reversible while binding of the mAb is slow and nearly irreversible. The enthalpic contribution to the DeltaG(bind) was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry and van't Hoff analysis. The contribution to the DeltaG(bind) from electrostatic steering was assessed from the dependence of the k(a) on ionic strength. Release of solvent H(2)O molecules from the interface was assessed by monitoring the decrease in amide solvent accessibility at the interface upon protein-protein binding. The mAb binding is enthalpy driven and has a slow k(d). TM binding appears to be entropy driven and has a fast k(a). The favorable entropy of the thrombin-TM interaction seems to be derived from electrostatic steering and a contribution from solvent release.

Ephrins have been shown to undergo regulated cleavage after interaction with their receptors. This process is inhibited by co-expression of ephrin-A1a and ephrin-A1b, indicating that ephrin-A1b influences the cleavage process.

Chemotactic activities of this region of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 are also mediated by alpha4beta1, whereas antagonism of fibroblast growth factor-2-stimulated chemotaxis is not mediated by this region. Immobilized N-terminal regions of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 promote endothelial cell survival and proliferation in an alpha4beta1-dependent manner.

The latter inhibition is thrombospondin-1-dependent and not observed in explants from thrombospondin-1-/- mice. Antagonizing alpha4beta1 may in part block proangiogenic activities of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2, because N-terminal regions of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 containing the alpha4beta1 binding sequence stimulate angiogenesis in vivo.

Chemerin is synthesized as a secreted precursor, prochemerin, which is poorly active, but converted into a full agonist of chemerinR by proteolytic removal of the last six amino acids. In the present work, we have synthesized a number of peptides derived from the C-terminal domain of human prochemerin and have investigated their functional properties as agonists or antagonists of human chemerinR. We found that the nonapeptide (149)YFPGQFAFS(157) (chemerin-9), corresponding to the C terminus of processed chemerin, retained most of the activity of the full-size protein, with regard to agonism toward the chemerinR. Extension of this peptide at its N terminus did not increase the activity, whereas further truncations rapidly resulted in inactive compounds. The C-terminal end of the peptide appeared crucial for its activity, as addition of a single amino acid or removal of two amino acids modified the potency by four orders of magnitude. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified residues Tyr(149), Phe(150), Gly(152), Phe(154), and Phe(156) as the key positions for chemerinR activation. A modified peptide (YHSFFFPGQFAFS) was synthesized and iodinated, and a radioligand binding assay was established. It was found that the ability of the various peptides to activate the chemerin receptor was strictly correlated with their affinity in the binding assay. These results confirm that a precise C-terminal processing is required for the generation of a chemerinR agonist. The possibility to restrict a medium sized protein to a nonapeptide, while keeping a low nanomolar affinity for its receptor is unusual among G protein-coupled receptors ligands. The identification of these short bioactive peptides will considerably accelerate the pharmacological analysis of chemerin-chemerinR interactions.',\n",

In this study, we sought to locate the binding sites of laminin-10 (alpha5beta1gamma1) for alpha(3)beta(1) and alpha(6)beta(1) integrins and alpha-dystroglycan through the production of a series of recombinant laminin-10 proteins with deletions of the LG (laminin G-like) modules within the globular domain. We found that deletion of the LG4-5 modules did not compromise the binding of laminin-10 to alpha(3)beta(1) and alpha(6)beta(1) integrins but completely abrogated its binding to alpha-dystroglycan. Further deletion up to the LG3 module resulted in loss of its binding to the integrins, underlining the importance of LG3 for integrin binding by laminin-10. When expressed individually as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase or the N-terminal 70-kDa region of fibronectin, only LG4 was capable of binding to alpha-dystroglycan, whereas neither LG3 nor any of the other LG modules retained the ability to bind to the integrins. Site-directed mutagenesis of the LG3 and LG4 modules indicated that Asp-3198 in the LG3 module is involved in the integrin binding by laminin-10, whereas multiple basic amino acid residues in the putative loop regions are involved synergistically in the alpha-dystroglycan binding by the LG4 module.',\n",

CADASIL is caused by mutations in NOTCH3, one of the four mammalian homologs to the Drosophila melanogaster NOTCH gene. Disease-associated mutations are distributed throughout the 34 epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGFRs) that compose the extracellular domain of the Notch3 receptor and result in a loss or a gain of a cysteine residue in one of these EGFRs. In human adults, Notch3 expression is highly restricted to vascular smooth-muscle cells. In patients with CADASIL, there is an abnormal accumulation of Notch3 in the vessel. Molecular pathways linking NOTCH3 mutations to degeneration of vascular smooth-muscle cells are as yet poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of CADASIL mutations on Notch3 activity. We studied five naturally occurring mutations: R90C and C212S, located in the previously identified mutational hotspot EGFR2-5; C428S, shown in this study to be located in the ligand-binding domain EGFR10-11; and C542Y and R1006C, located in EGFR13 and EGFR26, respectively. All five mutant proteins were correctly processed. The C428S and C542Y mutant receptors exhibited a significant reduction in Jagged1-induced transcriptional activity of a RBP/JK responsive luciferase reporter, relative to wild-type Notch3. Impaired signaling activity of these two mutants arose through different mechanisms; the C428S mutant lost its Jagged1-binding ability, whereas C542Y retained it but exhibited an impaired presentation to the cell surface. In contrast, the R90C, C212S, and R1006C mutants retained the ability to bind Jagged1 and were associated with apparently normal levels of signaling activity.

The purpose of this study was to identify the neuronal receptor that interacts with VFDNFVLK and to investigate the hypothesis that FD and FV are important for receptor binding. Function-blocking antibodies against both alpha7 and beta1 integrin subunits were found to abolish VFDNFVLK-mediated process extension from cerebellar granule neurons. VFDNFVLK but not its mutant, VSPNGSLK, induced clustering of neuronal beta1 integrin immunoreactivity. This strongly implicates FD and FV as important structural elements for receptor activation. Moreover, biochemical experiments revealed an association of the alpha7beta1 integrin with tenascin-C peptides containing the VFDNFVLK sequence but not with peptides with alterations in FD and/or FV. These findings are the first to provide evidence that the alpha7beta1 integrin mediates a response to tenascin-C and the first to demonstrate a functional role for the alpha7beta1 integrin receptor in CNS neurons.',\n",

It has long been suspected that neural CAMs might physically interact with RTKs, but their activation by specific cell adhesion events has not been directly demonstrated. Here we report that gain-of-function conditions of the Drosophila L1-type CAM Neuroglian result in profound sensory axon pathfinding defects in the developing Drosophila wing. This phenotype can be suppressed by decreasing the normal gene dosage of the Drosophila EGF receptor gene. Furthermore, in Drosophila S2 cells, cell adhesion mediated by human L1-CAM results in the specific activation of human EGF tyrosine kinase at cell contact sites and EGF receptors engage in a physical interaction with L1-CAM molecules.

In this study, we transfected hCGRP receptors into human embryonic kidney 293 cells and examined their pharmacological profiles using three dominant-negative (DN) RAMP mutants and various hCGRPalpha analogs. Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis revealed that their cotransfection with CTR2 induced cell surface expression of all three RAMPs, and the three CTR2/RAMP heterodimers mediated equivalent levels of cAMP production in response to hCGRPalpha that were approximately 50-fold greater than were seen with CTR2 alone. By contrast, [Tyr0]hCGRPalpha binding and signaling were markedly weaker with CTR2/RAMP2 or -3 than with CTR2/RAMP1 or CRLR/RAMP1; likewise, 125I-[His10]hCGRPalpha bound most potently to CTR2/RAMP1. When CTR2 was coexpressed with DN RAMP1 or -2, hCGRPalpha-evoked responses were similar to those seen with CTR2 alone, despite the expression of both CTR2 and DN RAMP at the cell surface. But coexpression of DN RAMP3 with CTR2 significantly diminished hCGRPalpha signaling compared with that seen with CTR2 alone, indicating that DN RAMP3 is able to function as a negative regulator of CTR2 function. Competition experiments showed the relative agonist sensitivity of the four receptors to be hCGRPalpha > [Tyr0]hCGRPalpha > [Cys(Et)2,7]hCGRPalpha > [Cys(ACM)2,7]hCGRPalpha.

Thus, among the three CGRP8-37-insensitive receptors, CTR2/RAMP1 is most sensitive to the two linear analogs, suggesting that it could be classified as a CGRP2 receptor.

Here, we report the crystal structure of the three-Ig form of FGFR3c in complex with FGF1, an FGF that binds promiscuously to each of the seven principal FGFRs. In this structure, D1 and the D1-D2 linker are completely disordered, demonstrating that these regions are dispensable for FGF binding. Real-time binding experiments using surface plasmon resonance show that relative to two-Ig form, the three-Ig form of FGFR3c exhibits lower affinity for both FGF1 and heparin. Importantly, we demonstrate that this autoinhibition is mediated by intramolecular interactions of D1 and the D1-D2 linker with the minimal FGF and heparin-binding D2-D3 region. As in the FGF1-FGFR2c structure, but not the FGF1-FGFR1c structure, the alternatively spliced betaC'-betaE loop is ordered and interacts with FGF1 in the FGF1-FGFR3c structure. However, in contrast to the FGF1-FGFR2c structure in which the betaC'-betaE loop interacts with the beta-trefoil core region of FGF1, in the FGF1-FGFR3c structure, this loop interacts extensively with the N-terminal region of FGF1, underscoring the importance of the FGF1 N terminus in conferring receptor-binding affinity and promiscuity.

Activation of the pathway leading to NF-kappaB by IL-1F6 and IL-1F8 follows a similar time course to activation by IL-1beta, suggesting that signaling by the novel family members occurs through a direct mechanism. In a mammary epithelial cell line, NCI/ADR-RES, which naturally expresses IL-1Rrp2, all three cytokines signal without further receptor transfection. IL-1Rrp2 antibodies block activation of the pathway leading to NF-kappaB by IL-1F6, IL-1F8, and IL-1F9 in both Jurkat and NCI/ADR-RES cells. In NCI/ADR-RES cells, the three IL-1 homologs activated the MAPKs, JNK and ERK1/2, and activated downstream targets as well, including an IL-8 promoter reporter and the secretion of IL-6. We also provide evidence that IL-1RAcP, in addition to IL-1Rrp2, is required for signaling by all three cytokines.

       " '14734748': 'The MHC class Ib molecule Qa-1 is the primary ligand for mouse CD94/NKG2A inhibitory receptors expressed on NK cells, in addition to presenting Ags to a subpopulation of T cells. CD94/NKG2A receptors specifically recognize Qa-1 bound to the MHC class Ia leader sequence-derived peptide Qdm. Qdm is the dominant peptide loaded onto Qa-1 under physiological conditions and this peptide has an optimal sequence for binding to Qa-1. Peptide dissociation experiments demonstrated that Qdm dissociates from soluble or cell surface Qa-1(b) molecules with a t(1/2) of approximately 1.5 h at 37 degrees C. In comparison, complexes of an optimal peptide (SIINFEKL) bound to the MHC class Ia molecule H-2K(b) dissociated with a t(1/2) in the range from 11 to 31 h. In contrast to K(b), the stability of cell surface Qa-1(b) molecules was independent of bound peptides, and several observations suggested that empty cell surface Qa-1(b) molecules might be unusually stable. Consistent with the rapid dissociation rate of Qdm from Qa-1(b), cells become susceptible to lysis by CD94/NKG2A(+) NK cells under conditions in which new Qa-1(b)/Qdm complexes cannot be continuously generated at the cell surface. These results support the hypothesis that Qa-1 has been selected as a specialized MHC molecule that is unable to form highly stable peptide complexes. We propose that the CD94/NKG2A-Qa-1/Qdm recognition system has evolved as a rapid sensor of the integrity of the MHC class I biosynthesis and Ag presentation pathway.',\n",

Here we show that mLRP4T100, a minireceptor of LRP1, another member of the LDLR family, interacts with the human Fz-1 (HFz1), previously shown to serve as a receptor transmitting the canonical Wnt-3a-induced signaling cascade. However, in contrast to LRP5/6, mLRP4T100, as well as the full-length LRP1, did not cooperate with HFz1 in transmitting the Wnt-3a signaling but rather repressed it. mLRP4T100 inhibitory effect was displayed also by endocytosis-defective mLRP4T100 mutants, suggesting that LRP1 repressive effect is not attributable to LRP1-mediated enhanced HFz1 internalization and subsequent degradation. Enforced expression of mLRP4T100 decreased the capacity of HFz1 cysteine-rich domain (CRD) to interact with LRP6, in contrast to HFz1-CRD/Wnt-3a interaction that was not disrupted by overexpressing mLRP4T100. These data suggest that LRP1, by sequestering HFz1, disrupts the receptor/coreceptor complex formation, leading to the repression of the canonical Wnt signaling. Thus, this study implies that the ability to interact with Fz receptors is shared by several members of the LDLR family. However, whereas some members of the LDLR family, such as LRP5/6, interact with Fz and serve as Wnt coreceptors, others negatively regulate Wnt signaling, presumably by sequestering Fz.',\n",

Lipid-free apoE3 inhibited the binding of (125)I-apoA-I to ABCA1 more efficiently than reconstituted HDL particles (IC(50) = 2.5 +/- 0.4 microg/ml vs. 12.3 +/- 1.3 microg/ml). ApoE isoforms showed similar binding for ABCA1 and exhibited identical kinetics in their abilities to induce ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux. Mutation of ABCA1 associated with Tangier disease (C1477R) abolished both apoE3 binding and apoE3-mediated cholesterol efflux. Analysis of apoE3-containing particles generated during the incubation of lipid-free apoE3 with stimulated normal cells showed nascent apoE3/cholesterol/phospholipid complexes that exhibited prebeta-electrophoretic mobility with a particle size ranging from 9 to 15 nm, whereas lipid-free apoE3 incubated with ABCA1 mutant (C1477R) cells was unable to form such particles. These results demonstrate that 1). apoE association with lipids reduced its ability to interact with ABCA1; 2). apoE isoforms did not affect apoE binding to ABCA1; 3). apoE-mediated ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux was not affected by apoE isoforms in fibroblasts; and 4). the lipid translocase activity of ABCA1 generates apoE-containing high density-sized lipoprotein particles.

Binding of biotin-HK to suPAR was inhibited by HK, 56HKa, and 46HKa with an IC50 of 60, 110, and 8 nm, respectively. We identified two suPAR-binding sites, a higher affinity site in the light chain of HK and 46HKa (His477-Gly496) and a lower affinity site within the heavy chain (Cys333-Lys345). HK predominantly bound to suPAR fragments containing domains 2 and 3 (S-D2D3). Binding of HK to domain 1 (S-D1) was also detected, and the addition of S-D1 to S-D2D3 completely inhibited biotin-HK or -46HKa binding to suPAR. Using sequential and overlapping 20-amino acid peptides prepared from suPAR, two regions for HK binding were identified. One on the carboxyl-terminal end of D2 (Leu166-Thr195) blocked HK binding to suPAR and to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). This site overlapped with the urokinase-binding region, and urokinase inhibited the binding of HK to suPAR. A second region on the amino-terminal portion of D3 (Gln215-Asn255) also blocked HK binding to HUVEC. Peptides that blocked HK binding to uPAR also inhibited prekallikrein activation on HUVEC. Therefore, HK interacts with suPAR at several sites. HK binds to uPAR as part of its interaction with its multiprotein receptor complex on HUVEC, and the biological functions that depend upon this binding are modulated by urokinase.',\n",

BCMA has been implicated as a receptor for both a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B cell-activating factor (BAFF), tumor necrosis factor ligands that bind to multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor and have been reported to play a role in autoimmune disease and cancer. The results presented herein provide a dual perspective analysis of BCMA binding to both APRIL and BAFF. First, we characterized the binding affinity of monomeric BCMA for its ligands; BAFF binding affinity (IC50 = 8 +/- 5 microm) is about 1000-fold reduced compared with the high affinity interaction of APRIL (IC50 = 11 +/- 3 nm). Second, shotgun alanine scanning of BCMA was used to map critical residues for either APRIL or BAFF binding. In addition to a previously described \"DXL\" motif (Gordon, N. C., Pan, B., Hymowitz, S. G., Yin, J., Kelley, R. F., Cochran, A. G., Yan, M., Dixit, V. M., Fairbrother, W. J., and Starovasnik, M. A. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 5977-5983), the alanine scanning results predicted four amino acid positions in BCMA (Tyr13, Ile22, Gln25, and Arg27) that could impart ligand specificity. Substitution of Tyr13 was tolerated for BAFF binding but not APRIL binding. Arg27 was required for high affinity binding to APRIL, whereas substitutions of this residue had minimal effect on affinity for BAFF. Further phage display experiments suggested the single mutations of I22K, Q25D, and R27Y as providing the greatest difference in APRIL versus BAFF binding affinity. Incorporation of the Q25D and R27Y substitutions into BCMA produced a dual specificity variant, since it has comparable binding affinity for both APRIL and BAFF, IC50 = 350 and 700 nm, respectively. Binding of the I22K mutant of monomeric BCMA to BAFF was undetectable (IC50 > 100 microm), but affinity for binding to APRIL was similar to wild-type BCMA. Based on these results, a BCMA-Fc fusion with the single I22K mutation was produced that binds APRIL, IC50 = 12 nm, and has no measurable affinity for BAFF. These results suggest that APRIL is the preferred ligand for BCMA and show that specificity can be further modified through amino acid substitutions.',\n",

Signaling through the IL-26R results in activation of STAT1 and STAT3 which can be blocked by neutralizing Abs against IL-20R1 or IL-10R2. IL-10R2 is broadly expressed on a wide variety of tissues, whereas only a limited number of tissues express IL-20R1.

However, in reconstituted non-neuronal systems, NgR1 and p75 together are unable to activate RhoA, suggesting that additional components of the receptor may exist. Here we describe LINGO-1, a nervous system-specific transmembrane protein that binds NgR1 and p75 and that is an additional functional component of the NgR1/p75 signaling complex. In non-neuronal cells, coexpression of human NgR1, p75 and LINGO-1 conferred responsiveness to oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein, as measured by RhoA activation. A dominant-negative human LINGO-1 construct attenuated myelin inhibition in transfected primary neuronal cultures. This effect on neurons was mimicked using an exogenously added human LINGO-1-Fc fusion protein. Together these observations suggest that LINGO-1 has an important role in CNS biology.',\n",

EDS cells also show reduced levels of fibronectin (FN) in the culture medium and lack an FN fibrillar network. Finally, EDS cells prevalently organize alpha(v)beta(3) integrin instead of alpha(5)beta(1) integrin. The alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, distributed on the whole EDS cell surface, shows FN binding and assembly properties when the cells are treated with purified FN. Treatment of EDS cells with purified COLLV or COLLIII, but not with FN, restores the control phenotype (COLL(+), FN(+), alpha(v)beta(3)(-), alpha(5)beta(1)(+), alpha(2)beta(1)(+)).

These results show that in human fibroblasts alpha(2)beta(1) integrin organization and function are controlled by its ligand, and that the alpha(2)beta(1)-COLL interaction, in turn, regulates FN integrin receptor recruitment: high alpha(2)beta(1) integrin levels induce alpha(5)beta(1) integrin organization, while low alpha(2)beta(1) integrin levels lead to alpha(v)beta(3) integrin organization.',\n",

Unlike a number of other ADAM proteins, which interact with integrin receptors via their disintegrin domains, there is currently no evidence for an ADAM-17-integrin association. By analyzing the adhesion of a series of cell lines with recombinant fragments of the extracellular domain of ADAM-17, we now demonstrate a functional interaction between ADAM-17 and alpha(5)beta(1) integrin in a trans orientation. Because ADAM-17-mediated adhesion was sensitive to RGD peptides and EDTA, and the integrin-binding site within ADAM-17 was narrowed down to the disintegrin/cysteine-rich region, the two molecules appear to have a ligand-receptor relationship mediated by the alpha(5)beta(1) ligand binding pocket. Intriguingly, ADAM-17 and alpha(5)beta(1) were found to co-localize in both membrane ruffles and focal adhesions in HeLa cells. When confluent HeLa cell monolayers were wounded, ADAM-17 and alpha(5)beta(1) redistributed to the leading edge and co-localized, which is suggestive of a cis orientation.

S2 protein increased in the renal interstitium in diabetes and regulated TGF-beta-mediated increased matrix deposition in vitro. Transfection of renal papillary fibroblasts with S2 or a S2 construct that has a truncated cytoplasmic domain (S2DeltaS) promoted TGF-beta binding and S2 core protein ectodomain directly bound TGF-beta.

Sema6D also exerts region-specific activities on cardiac explants, a migration-promoting activity on outgrowing cells from the conotruncal segment, and a migration-inhibitory activity on those from the ventricle. Plexin-A1 mediates these activities as the major Sema6D-binding receptor. Plexin-A1 forms a receptor complex with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 in the conotruncal segment or with Off-track in the ventricle segment; these complexes are responsible for the effects of Sema6D on the respective regions.

To accomplish this diverse role, LRP is composed of repetitive amino acid motifs consisting of complement-type and EGF precursor-type repeats. Within these repeats are six conserved cysteine residues that form the core disulfide bond structure of each repeat. To accommodate the intricate folding that such a complex structure dictates, a specialized chaperone is present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) called the receptor-associated protein (RAP) that binds to LRP immediately following its biosynthesis and assists in its exocytic transport. Interestingly, RAP -/- mice show reduced LRP expression in certain cell types, but not a more global affect on LRP expression that was expected. Such a tissue-restricted effect by RAP prompted an investigation if other ER chaperones associate with LRP to assist in its complex folding requirements and compensate for the absence of RAP in RAP -/- cells. Fibroblasts obtained from RAP -/- mice demonstrate similar LRP expression levels and subcellular distribution as RAP +/+ fibroblasts. Moreover, RAP -/- cells show an identical exocytic trafficking rate for LRP as RAP +/+ cells and comparable cell surface internalization kinetics. In RAP -/- cells, three well-known ER chaperones, calnexin, calreticulin, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), associate with LRP and likely compensate for the absence of RAP.',\n",

Subsequent gamma-secretase cleavage in the transmembrane region of the C-terminal fragment induces secretion of small extracellular peptides, including Abeta40 and Abeta42, which are instrumental in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and intracellular release of a cytoplasmic tail fragment. Although APP resembles a cell-surface receptor, no functionally active extracellular ligand for APP that might regulate its proteolytic processing has been described. We now show that F-spondin, a secreted signaling molecule implicated in neuronal development and repair, binds to the conserved central extracellular domain of APP and inhibits beta-secretase cleavage of APP.

It acts as a receptor for neurotensin, but predominates in regions of the nervous system that neither synthesize nor respond to this neuropeptide, suggesting that sortilin has additional roles. Sortilin is expressed during embryogenesis in areas where nerve growth factor (NGF) and its precursor, proNGF, have well-characterized effects. These neurotrophins can be released by neuronal tissues, and they regulate neuronal development through cell survival and cell death signalling. NGF regulates cell survival and cell death via binding to two different receptors, TrkA and p75NTR (ref. 10). In contrast, proNGF selectively induces apoptosis through p75NTR but not TrkA. However, not all p75NTR-expressing cells respond to proNGF, suggesting that additional membrane proteins are required for the induction of cell death.

Consistent with this, it also retained the ability to block the uptake and degradation of (125)I-TSP-1. However, TSP-1(1-90) itself was poorly endocytosed and this truncated amino-terminal domain was considerably more effective than the full-length heparin-binding domain (HBD) of TSP-1 in blocking the catabolism of endogenously expressed TSP-1.

Low-affinity binding is associated with a 55-kDa alpha chain, intermediate-affinity binding with a 70-75-kD beta chain, and high-affinity binding with a bimolecular complex of the alpha and beta subunits. In a previous study of the IL-2 receptors expressed on NK cells obtained from cancer patients after in vivo IL-2 therapy, we documented a discrepancy between the level of beta chain and the level of intermediate-affinity IL-2 binding sites expressed on the cell surface. Based on this result, we postulated that formation of intermediate-affinity receptor sites required a component in addition to the beta chain, and that this component was present at limiting levels in the patient NK cells. In the present study we have examined the structure of the intermediate-affinity receptor complex using monoclonal antibodies that recognize the beta chain, but that do not interfere with its ability to bind IL-2. Evidence is presented establishing the physical association of a novel protein of 64 kD with the beta chain in intermediate-affinity IL-2 binding sites. This molecule, termed IL-2R gamma chain, coprecipitated with beta chains prepared from cells that had been incubated with IL-2, but was undetectable in immunoprecipitates prepared in the absence of IL-2. Examination of gamma chain expression in post-IL-2 therapy NK cells, where only low levels of intermediate-affinity IL-2 binding were detectable, revealed that the gamma chain was associated with, on average, only 10-12% of the beta chains expressed on such cells. This contrasted with approximately equal levels of beta and gamma chain expression on YT cells, a cell line that has both high levels of cell surface beta chain expression and high levels of IL-2 binding. Thus, the ratio of gamma chain to beta chain present in the immunoprecipitates roughly correlated with the proportion of beta chain involved in intermediate-affinity receptor sites. This result suggests that the 64-kD gamma chain is the component responsible for regulating the affinity of IL-2 association with the beta subunit. By further defining the structural components necessary for IL-2 receptor formation, these studies provide additional insight into mechanisms whereby lymphocytes might regulate their responsiveness to IL-2.',\n",

Strong adhesion of the blastocyst to fibronectin (FN) requires integrin signaling initiated by exogenous fibronectin. However, it is not known how integrin signaling enhances blastocyst adhesion. We present new evidence that the integrin, alphaIIbbeta3, plays a key role in trophoblast adhesion to fibronectin during mouse peri-implantation development. Trafficking of alphaIIb to the apical surface of the trophoblast increased dramatically after blastocysts were exposed to fibronectin, whereas other fibronectin-binding integrins, alpha5beta1 and alphaVbeta3, were resident at the apical surface before ligand exposure. Functional comparisons among the three integrins revealed that ligation of alpha5beta1 most efficiently strengthened blastocyst fibronectin-binding activity, while subsequent trophoblast cell migration was dependent primarily on the beta3-class integrins. In vivo, alphaIIb was highly expressed by invasive trophoblast cells in the ectoplacental cone and trophoblast giant cells of the parietal yolk sac.

In this study, we show that NK cells recognize PVR through an additional receptor, CD96, or T cell-activated increased late expression (Tactile). CD96 promotes NK cell adhesion to target cells expressing PVR, stimulates cytotoxicity of activated NK cells, and mediates acquisition of PVR from target cells. Thus, NK cells have evolved a dual receptor system that recognizes nectins and nectin-like molecules on target cells and mediates NK cell adhesion and triggering of effector functions. As PVR is highly expressed in certain tumors, this receptor system may be critical for NK cell recognition of tumors.',\n",

Norrin, the protein product of the Norrie disease gene, is a secreted protein of unknown biochemical function. One form of FEVR is caused by defects in Frizzled-4 (Fz4), a presumptive Wnt receptor. We show here that Norrin and Fz4 function as a ligand-receptor pair based on (1) the similarity in vascular phenotypes caused by Norrin and Fz4 mutations in humans and mice, (2) the specificity and high affinity of Norrin-Fz4 binding, (3) the high efficiency with which Norrin induces Fz4- and Lrp-dependent activation of the classical Wnt pathway, and (4) the signaling defects displayed by disease-associated variants of Norrin and Fz4. These data define a Norrin-Fz4 signaling system that plays a central role in vascular development in the eye and ear, and they indicate that ligands unrelated to Wnts can act through Fz receptors.',\n",

Although not characterized extensively yet, its expression profile coincides with a potential role in allergic inflammation. We recently reported that eotaxin-3 is an antagonist for CCR2 (Ogilvie, P., Paoletti, S., Clark-Lewis, I., and Uguccioni, M. (2003) Blood 102, 789-784). In the present report, we provide evidence that eotaxin-3 acts as a natural antagonist on CCR1 and -5 as well. Eotaxin-3 bound to cells transfected with either CCR1 or -5 as well as to monocytes expressing both receptors. Further, it inhibited chemotaxis, the release of free intracellular calcium, and actin polymerization when cells were stimulated with known agonists of CCR1 and -5. An analysis of its three-dimensional structure indicated the presence of two distinct epitopes that may be involved in specific binding to CCR1, -2, -3, and -5. Taken together, our data thus indicate eotaxin-3 to be the first human chemokine that features broadband antagonistic activities, suggesting that it may have a modulatory rather than an inflammatory function. Further, eotaxin-3 may play an unrecognized role in the polarization of cellular recruitment by attracting Th2 lymphocytes as well as eosinophils and basophils via CCR3, while concomitantly blocking the recruitment of Th1 lymphocytes and monocytes via CCR1, -2, and -5.',\n",

In GPI-ACE expressing cells, the B(2) receptor was still activated by the agonists, but ACE inhibitors did not resensitize. Pretreatment with filipin returned the sensitivity to inhibitors. In immunocytochemistry, GPI-ACE showed patchy, uneven distribution on the plasma membrane that was restored by filipin. Thus, ACE inhibitors were inactive as long as GPI-ACE was sequestered in cholesterol-rich membrane domains.

The 3.0-A resolution crystal structure of the complex formed between human DPPIV and bovine ADA presented here shows that each beta-propeller domain of the DPPIV dimer binds one ADA. At the binding interface, two hydrophobic loops protruding from the beta-propeller domain of DPPIV interact with two hydrophilic and heavily charged alpha-helices of ADA, giving rise to the highest percentage of charged residues involved in a protein-protein contact reported thus far. Additionally, four glycosides linked to Asn229 of DPPIV bind to ADA.

For Eph receptor ligands, it provides the switch between cell-cell adhesion and repulsion. Ligand shedding is tightly controlled by intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, which for Eph receptors relies on the release of an inhibitory interaction of the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane segment with the kinase domain. However, a mechanism linking kinase and sheddase activities had remained elusive. We demonstrate that it is a membrane-proximal localisation of the latent kinase domain that prevents ephrin ligand shedding in trans. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and electron tomography reveal that activation extends the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase intracellular domain away from the cell membrane into a conformation that facilitates productive association with ADAM10. Accordingly, EphA3 mutants with constitutively-released kinase domains efficiently support shedding, even when their kinase is disabled. Our data suggest that this phosphorylation-activated conformational switch of EphA3 directly controls ADAM-mediated shedding.']},\n",

We expressed a recombinant MDC-15 disintegrin-like domain as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (designated D-15) in bacteria and examined its binding function to integrins using mammalian cells expressing different recombinant integrins.

It could be shown that PACAP(1-27) exhibited a distinct and much higher susceptibility to VIP-amino acid substitutions, compared to PACAP(1-38). Positions 4 and 5 seem to be most important for receptor binding of PACAP(1-27), whereas position 13 was identified to be crucial for maximal affinity of PACAP(1-38).

The aim of the present study was to identify PACAP receptor isoforms and to determine whether PACAP can affect intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and catecholamine secretion. Using primary cultures and specific stimulation of chromaffin cells, we demonstrate that PACAP-38 induced an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) that was blocked by PACAP (6-38), was independent of external Ca(2+), and originated from thapsigargin-insensitive internal stores. The PACAP-triggered Ca(2+) increase was not affected by inhibition of PLC beta (preincubation with U-73122) or by pretreatment of cells with Xestospongin C, indicating that the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive stores were not mobilized. However, forskolin (FSK), which raises cytosolic cAMP, induced an increase in Ca(2+) similar to that recorded with PACAP-38. Blockage of PKA by H-89 or (R(p))-cAMPS suppressed both PACAP-38 and FSK calcium responses. The effect of PACAP-38 was also abolished by emptying the caffeine/ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) stores. Furthermore, treatment of cells with orthovanadate (100 microm) impaired Ca(2+) reloading of PACAP-sensitive stores indicating that PACAP-38 can mobilize Ca(2+) from secretory vesicles. Moreover, PACAP induced catecholamine secretion by chromaffin cells. It is concluded that PACAP-38, through the PAC(1) receptor, acts as a neurotransmitter in human fetal chromaffin cells inducing catecholamine secretion, through nonclassical, recently described, ryanodine/caffeine-sensitive pools, involving a cAMP- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation mechanism.',\n",

It is widely distributed in the body, and a variety of biological actions have been reported. PACAP exerts its biological effects by binding to specific receptors that are coupled to GTP-binding proteins. Recent studies have shown that there is a family of PACAP receptors (PACAPRs), and two members of this family have been identified. We report here the cloning, functional expression, and tissue distribution of a third PACAPR subtype, designated PACAPR-3. The cDNA encoding PACAPR-3 has been isolated from a mouse insulin-secreting beta-cell line MIN6 cDNA library. Mouse PACAPR-3 is a protein of 437 amino acids that has 50% and 51% identity with rat PACAP type I and type II receptors, respectively. Expression of recombinant mouse PACAPR-3 in mammalian cells shows that it binds to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide as well as PACAP-38 and -27, with a slightly higher affinity for PACAP-38, and is positively coupled to adenylate cyclase. The expression of PACAPR-3 in Xenopus oocytes indicates that calcium-activated chloride currents are evoked by PACAP and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, suggesting that PACAPR-3 can also be coupled to phospholipase C. RNA blot analysis studies reveal that PACAPR-3 mRNA is expressed at high levels in MIN6, at moderate levels in pancreatic islets and other insulin-secreting cell lines, HIT-T15 and RINm5F, as well as in the lung, brain, stomach, and colon, and at low levels in the heart. Furthermore, insulin secretion from MIN6 cells is significantly stimulated by PACAP-38. These results suggest that the diverse biological effects of PACAP are mediated by a family of structurally related proteins and that PACAPR-3 participates in the regulation of insulin secretion.',\n",

The adsorbed PACAP receptors were eluted with an acidic buffer containing 1.0 M NaCl (pH 4.0). The eluted receptors were purified further by hydroxylapatite and gel filtration chromatography. A single protein band with a M(r) = 55,000-60,000 was found in the final preparation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Affinity labeling of the purified receptors with 125I-PACAP27 labeled the M(r) 55,000-60,000 protein specifically. The dissociation constant and the specific activity of the purified receptors were 25.8 pM and 17.2 nmol of ligand binding per mg of protein, respectively. Inhibitory constants determined by competitive binding experiments were 30.0 pM for PACAP27, 4.6 pM for PACAP38, and 37.3 nM for vasoactive intestinal peptide. Therefore, the purified PACAP receptor retained high affinity and ligand specificity. The sequence of the amino-terminal 29 residues was derived from the purified receptor.',\n",

In addition, we demonstrated that the potencies of the two forms of PACAP are similar for adenylate cyclase stimulation, whereas PACAP-38 is more potent than PACAP-27 in phospholipase C activation. In the present work, we document the existence of a new splice variant of the PACAP receptor that was characterized by a 21-amino-acid deletion in the N-terminal extracellular domain. We demonstrate that this domain modulates receptor selectivity with respect to PACAP-27 and -38 binding and controls the relative potencies of the two agonists in phospholipase C stimulation.']},\n",

To investigate whether PACAP alters chief cell function, we prepared isolated chief cells (> 90% pure) from guinea pig stomach. PACAP-38, PACAP-27, VIP, and secretin all caused a threefold increase in pepsinogen release. The dose-response curves of PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP were biphasic, whereas with secretin it was not. The first phase comprised 40% of maximal release, and each of the three peptides (PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP) were equipotent (EC50 0.1-0.3 nM). For the second phase, comprising 60% of maximal release, the relative potencies were PACAP-38 > PACAP-27 = VIP. 125I-labeled secretin, 125I-VIP, and 125I-PACAP-27 all demonstrated saturable binding to chief cells. Binding of both 125I-PACAP-27 and 125I-VIP was inhibited completely and with similar potencies by PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP. Secretin had a > 500-fold lower affinity than PACAP-38 for displacing both 125I-PACAP-27 and 125I-VIP. With 125I-secretin, secretin was the most potent, and was 197 times more potent than PACAP-38, which was 6-8 times more potent than both PACAP-27 and VIP. We conclude that both PACAP-38 and PACAP-27 stimulate pepsinogen secretion from dispersed chief cells. In contrast to a number of other tissues, no evidence for a high-affinity receptor that interacted only with PACAP was found.

Unlike carbachol, PACAP and VIP had no effect on inositol phosphate production. In the PAC1-deficient mouse, the insulinotropic effect of PACAP was reduced, and its differential effect on cAMP production was abolished, whereas the effects of VIP remained unchanged. These results clearly show that the insulinotropic effect of PACAP involved both VPAC and PAC1.

The key isoform of CD97 expressed on leukocytes binds the complement regulatory protein CD55 (also termed decay-accelerating factor). CD97 has been shown recently to mediate co-stimulation of T cells via CD55. Here, we demonstrate that blocking the interaction between CD55 on monocytes and CD97 on T cells leads to inhibition of proliferation and interferon-gamma secretion. This implies that bidirectional interactions between CD97 and CD55 are involved in T cell regulation. Structural studies presented here reveal the molecular basis for this activity. We have solved the structure of EMR2, a very close homolog of CD97, using x-ray crystallography. NMR-based chemical shift mapping of the EMR2-CD55 interaction has allowed us to generate a model for the CD97-CD55 complex. The structure of the complex reveals that the T cell and complement regulatory activities of CD55 occur on opposite faces of the molecule. This suggests that CD55 might simultaneously regulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses, and we have shown that CD55 can still regulate complement when bound to CD97.']},\n",

CD97 was upregulated on polymorphonuclear cells (PMNC) of patients with psoriasis. In psoriatic skin lesions, CD97(+) myeloid cells colocalized with Thy-1(+) EC of small vessels in microabscesses, suggesting an interaction between CD97 and Thy-1 that was further examined by adhesion and protein-binding assays. PMNC and cell lines stably overexpressing CD97 adhered specifically to Thy-1(+)-activated human dermal EC, Thy-1(+) CHO cells, and immobilized Thy-1 protein. Binding of the CD97(+) CHO clones correlated with their CD97 expression level. Soluble CD97 bound specifically to immobilized Thy-1 protein, as well as Thy-1(+)-activated EC and CHO cells. In all assays, cellular adhesion or protein binding was blocked partially by CD97 and Thy-1-blocking mAb. Our data suggested that CD97 interacts via its stalk with Thy-1 because mAb directed to the stalk of CD97 showed stronger blocking compared with mAb to its epidermal growth factor-like domains, and binding was calcium independent. Moreover, soluble CD97 without the stalk and soluble EMR2, containing highly homologous epidermal growth factor-like domains but a different stalk, failed to bind. In summary, binding of leukocytes to activated endothelium mediated by the interaction of CD97 with Thy-1 is involved in firm adhesion of PMNC during inflammation and may play a role in the regulation of leukocyte trafficking to inflammatory sites.']},\n",

These observations are potentially intriguing in view of the proposed role for Drosophila teneurins in determining synapse specificity. However, teneurins in Drosophila were suggested to act as homophilic cell-adhesion molecules, whereas our findings suggest a heterophilic interaction mechanism. Thus, we tested whether mammalian teneurins also are homophilic cell-adhesion molecules, in addition to binding to latrophilins as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules. Strikingly, we find that although teneurins bind to each other in solution, homophilic teneurin-teneurin binding is unable to support stable cell adhesion, different from heterophilic teneurin-latrophilin binding.

Analysis of intermedin expression indicated that intermedin is expressed primarily in the pituitary and gastrointestinal tract. Intermedin increased cAMP production in SK-N-MC and L6 cells expressing endogenous CGRP receptors and competed with labeled CGRP for binding to its receptors in these cells. In addition, treatment of 293T cells expressing recombinant calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and one of the three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) showed that a CRLR/RAMP receptor complex is required for intermedin signaling. In contrast to CGRP and ADM, which exhibited a preferential stimulation of CRLR when co-expressed with RAMP1 and RAMP2 or RAMP3, respectively, intermedin represents a nonselective agonist for the RAMP coreceptors. In vivo studies demonstrated that intermedin treatment led to blood pressure reduction in both normal and spontaneously hypertensive rats via interactions with the CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes.

An expressed sequence tag was identified that encodes Agouti-related protein, whose RNA is normally expressed in the hypothalamus and whose levels were increased eightfold in ob/ob mice. Recombinant Agouti-related protein was a potent, selective antagonist of Mc3r and Mc4r, melanocortin receptor subtypes implicated in weight regulation. Ubiquitous expression of human AGRP complementary DNA in transgenic mice caused obesity without altering pigmentation. Thus, Agouti-related protein is a neuropeptide implicated in the normal control of body weight downstream of leptin signaling.',\n",
       "   'Agouti protein and the Agouti-related protein (AGRP) are antagonists of the melanocortin-3 receptor and melanocortin-4 receptor. Both proteins contain 10 cysteines in the C-terminal domain arranged in five disulfide bonds. One possible arrangement of the disulfide bonds predicts an octapeptide loop, and the chemical properties of four residues within this loop (residues 111-114 in human AGRP) bear striking resemblance to those of several melanocortin peptides, including alpha-MSH, MT-II, and SHU-9119. We showed that cyclic synthetic octapeptides based on the sequence of this loop from Agouti protein or human AGRP are functional antagonists of the human melanocortin-4 receptor. All peptides had a lower affinity for the melanocortin-3 receptor than for the melanocortin-4 receptor. Substitution of serines for cysteines resulted in linear peptides which had reduced binding affinities for both receptors. Mutational analysis of human AGRP indicated that its C-terminal domain is functionally equivalent to the intact human AGRP. The RFF111-113 triplet appears to be the most critical portion of AGRP in determining the binding affinity for both melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors. These data strongly suggest that the loop defined by Cys-110 and Cys-117 is critical in determining the antagonist activity of human AGRP. Our data provide indirect evidence for the suggestion that the Cys-110 to Cys-117 octapeptide loop of human AGRP mimics the conformation of alpha-MSH, MT-II, and SHU-9119.']},\n",

       "  'Abstracts': ['Agouti-related protein (AGRP) is a naturally occurring antagonist of melanocortin action that is thought to play an important role in the hypothalamic control of feeding behavior. The exact mechanism of AGRP and Agouti protein action has been difficult to examine, in part because of difficulties in producing homogeneous forms of these molecules that can be used for direct binding assays. In this report we describe the application of chemical protein synthesis to the construction of two novel AGRP variants. Examination of the biological activity of the AGRP variants demonstrates that a truncated variant, human AGRP(87-132), a 46-amino acid variant based on the carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich domain of AGRP, is equipotent to an 111-amino acid variant, mouse [Leu127Pro]AGRP (mature AGRP minus its signal sequence), in its ability to dose dependently inhibit alpha-MSH-generated cAMP generation at the cloned melanocortin receptors. Furthermore, deletion of the amino-terminal portion of the full-length variant did not alter the MCR subtype specificity of AGRP(87-132). Finally, iodination of human AGRP(87-132) provided a useful reagent with which the binding properties of AGRP could be analyzed. In both conventional and photoemulsion binding studies [125I]AGRP(87-132) was observed only to bind to cells expressing melanocortin receptors MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R. These results demonstrate that the residues critical for receptor binding, alpha-MSH inhibition, and melanocortin receptor subtype specificity are all located in the carboxyl terminus of the molecule. Because [Nle4, D-Phe7] (NDP)-MSH displaces the binding of [125I]AGRP(87-132) to MCRs and AGRP(87-132) displaces the binding of [125I]NDP-MSH, we conclude that these molecules bind in a competitive fashion to melanocortin receptors.']},\n",

Their potencies are lower in the presence of bovine serum albumin. 5. Preincubation with the insurmountable antagonist candesartan decreased the maximal angiotensin II induced inositol phosphate accumulation up to 94% and, concomitantly, decreased the maximal binding capacity of the cell surface receptors. These inhibitory effects were half-maximal for 0.6 nM candesartan and were attenuated by simultaneous preincubation with 1 microM losartan indicating a syntopic action of both antagonists. 6. Losartan caused a parallel rightward shift of the angiotensin II concentration-response curves and did not affect the maximal binding capacity. EXP3174 (the active metabolite of losartan) and irbesartan showed a mixed-type behavior in both functional and binding studies. 7.

       "   'The octapeptide hormone, angiotensin II (Ang II), exerts its major physiological effects by activating AT(1) receptors. In vivo Ang II is degraded to bioactive peptides, including Ang III (angiotensin-(2-8)) and Ang IV (angiotensin-(3-8)). These peptides stimulate inositol phosphate generation in human AT(1) receptor expressing CHO-K1 cells, but the potency of Ang IV is very low. Substitution of Asn(111) with glycine, which is known to cause constitutive receptor activation by disrupting its interaction with the seventh transmembrane helix (TM VII), selectively increased the potency of Ang IV (900-fold) and angiotensin-(4-8), and leads to partial agonism of angiotensin-(5-8). Consistent with the need for the interaction between Arg(2) of Ang II and Ang III with Asp(281), substitution of this residue with alanine (D281A) decreased the peptide\\'s potency without affecting that of Ang IV. All effects of the D281A mutation were superseded by the N111G mutation. The increased affinity of Ang IV to the N111G mutant was also demonstrated by binding studies. A model is proposed in which the Arg(2)-Asp(281) interaction causes a conformational change in TM VII of the receptor, which, similar to the N111G mutation, eliminates the constraining intramolecular interaction between Asn(111) and TM VII. The receptor adopts a more relaxed conformation, allowing the binding of the C-terminal five residues of Ang II that switches this \"preactivated\" receptor into the fully active conformation.',\n",
       "   'Enhanced renal expression for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is detected in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Previous data showed an altered glomerular expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), suggesting a regulatory response to high intrarenal angiotensin II (Ang II) concentration in IgAN. In this study, the expression and regulation of Ang II receptors were examined in human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) in IgAN. Tubular expression of AT1R and Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) was increased in IgAN. In vitro culture experiment showed that the upregulation of Ang II receptors was not due to the direct effect of IgA but the indirect effect after IgA deposition on human mesangial cell. When PTEC were cultured with conditioned culture medium from human mesangial cells activated with IgA, Ang II production was upregulated, leading to inflammation and apoptosis via the AT1R and AT2R, respectively. Sequential expression of Ang II receptors determined the injury of PTEC induced by mediators in the conditioned medium. The initial interaction between Ang II and AT1R activated both protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, leading to inflammatory responses. This early AT1R-dependent event was followed by upregulation of AT2R expression and continued Ang II release. The interaction between Ang II and AT2R subsequently led to expression of cleaved poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase through downregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The data suggest that appropriate control of Ang II receptor activities in PTEC may ameliorate tubulointerstitial injury in IgAN.',\n",

       "   'Serum albumin filtered in renal glomeruli is reabsorbed very efficiently in the proximal tubule by endocytosis. The present study was undertaken to determine whether megalin/gp330 binds and mediates endocytosis of albumin. Rat serum albumin (RSA) labeled with 125I and colloidal gold particles labeled with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were microinfused into rat surface proximal tubules in vivo, and tubular uptake was determined in the presence or absence of different substances known to interfere with ligand binding to megalin. Binding of 125I-BSA and 125I-RSA to purified megalin was also determined directly using Sepharose columns. The results revealed that the tubular uptake of 125I-labeled RSA was significantly inhibited by receptor-associated protein (RAP), which reduced the uptake by > 50% and by cold RSA. The uptake of BSA gold by the proximal tubule was very intensive. BSA gold was found in small and large endocytic vacuoles, dense apical tubules, and in lysosomes. The uptake was reduced by RAP to 17%, by EDTA to 19%, by BSA to 16%, by megalin to 35%, by cytochrome c to 49%, and, together with gentamicin, there was virtually no uptake. Megalin-Sepharose columns bound 125I-labeled BSA as well as 125I-RSA, the binding was inhibited by RAP and EDTA, and analysis of the eluate revealed the bound tracer to be albumin. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that megalin is a mediator of albumin reabsorption in renal proximal tubules.']},\n",

Moreover, ALCAM-blocking antibodies interfere with DC-T-cell conjugate formation, demonstrating that CD6-ALCAM binding is essential for stable T-cell-APC contact. We now demonstrate that besides their role in establishing initial contacts, CD6-ALCAM interactions are also required during the proliferative phase of the T-cell response; the presence of CD6-blocking antibodies or recombinant ALCAM-Fc proteins results in a strong and sustained inhibition of T-cell proliferation. Furthermore, simultaneous crosslinking of CD6 and CD3 induces enhanced proliferation and transcriptional activity to a similar level as observed after CD3 and CD28 co-crosslinking, demonstrating that CD6 is an important costimulatory molecule. The stability of ALCAM-CD6 binding, which contrasts with transient homotypic ALCAM-ALCAM interactions, further supports the long-lasting effects observed on T-cell proliferation.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based competition assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments analyzing the binding of Ang-1 and Ang-2 to truncation mutants of the extracellular domain of Tie-2 showed that the first Ig-like loop of Tie-2 in combination with the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (amino acids 1-360) is required for angiopoietin binding.

Concomitantly, we made the surprising finding that Tie-2 exon-2 knockout mice do express a mutated Tie-2 protein that lacks 104 amino acids of the first Ig-like domain. This mutant Tie-2 receptor is functionally inactive as shown by the lack of ligand binding and receptor phosphorylation.

Elucidating Ang2-dependent mechanisms of vascular destablization is critical for rational design of angiopoietin antagonists that have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in cancer trials. Here, we report that Ang2, but not Ang1, activates Î²1-integrin, leading to endothelial destablization. Autocrine Ang2 signalling upon Tie2 silencing, or in Ang2 transgenic mice, promotes Î²1-integrin-positive elongated matrix adhesions and actin stress fibres, regulating vascular endothelial-cadherin-containing cell-cell junctions. The Tie2-silenced monolayer integrity is rescued by Î²1-integrin, phosphoinositide-3 kinase or Rho kinase inhibition, and by re-expression of a membrane-bound Tie2 ectodomain. Furthermore, Tie2 silencing increases, whereas Ang2 blocking inhibits transendothelial tumour cell migration in vitro.

Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) is an angiogenic factor that signals through the endothelial cell-specific Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase. Like vascular endothelial growth factor, Ang1 is essential for normal vascular development in the mouse. An Ang1 relative, termed angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), was identified by homology screening and shown to be a naturally occurring antagonist for Ang1 and Tie2. Transgenic overexpression of Ang2 disrupts blood vessel formation in the mouse embryo. In adult mice and humans, Ang2 is expressed only at sites of vascular remodeling.

TEK comprises a subfamily of RTK with TIE, and these two receptors play critical roles in vascular maturation, maintenance of integrity and remodeling. We generated mAb against the extracellular domain of human TEK protein to elucidate its expression pattern in human hematopoietic cells. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow cells revealed that TEK was expressed in 27% of CD34+ cells, 20% of c-KIT+ cells and 26% of CD34+CD38- cells, indicating that TEK is expressed in a subset of primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). TEK was also expressed in 20% of CD19+ B lymphocytes but not in other lineage-committed cells. Progenitor assays in methylcellulose culture showed that CD34+TEK+ cells formed significantly less BFU-E and CFU-Mix than CD34+TEK- cells, but there was no difference in the number of CFU-GM between these two populations. Two recently identified TEK ligands, termed Angiopoietin-1 and -2, bound to TEK with similar affinities, and Angiopoietin-1 effectively induced TEK phosphorylation in hematopoietic cells. Angiopoietin-2 also induced a low level of TEK phosphorylation and weakened the phosphorylation induced by Angiopoietin-1, suggestive of an elaborate regulator of the TEK-TEK ligand signaling pathway. Although neither ligands affected the proliferation of TEK-transfected hematopoietic cells or the colony formation of CD34+TEK+ bone marrow cells, both promoted the adhesion of TEK-transfected hematopoietic cells to a collagen matrix or a layer of bone marrow stromal cells. These findings indicate that the TEK-TEK ligand signaling pathway is regulated in a refined manner and is involved in hematopoietic cell-microenvironment interaction.']},\n",

Interestingly, while ANGPTL4 modestly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2, promotion of vascular permeability by ANGPTL4 was independent of this receptor. Instead, we found that ANGPTL4 binds directly to neuropilin 1 (NRP1) and NRP2 on endothelial cells (ECs), leading to rapid activation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway and breakdown of EC-EC junctions. Treatment with a soluble fragment of NRP1 (sNRP1) prevented ANGPTL4 from binding to NRP1 and blocked ANGPTL4-induced activation of RhoA as well as EC permeability in vitro and retinal vascular leakage in diabetic animals in vivo. In addition, sNRP1 reduced the stimulation of EC permeability by aqueous fluid from patients with DME.

We have previously demonstrated that anosmin-1, a glycosylated extracellular matrix protein, interacts with the FGFR1 signaling complex and enhances its activity in an IIIc isoform-specific and HS-dependent manner. The molecular mechanism of anosmin-1 action on FGFR1 signaling, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that anosmin-1 directly binds to FGFR1 with high affinity. This interaction involves domains in the N terminus of anosmin-1 (cysteine-rich region, whey acidic protein-like domain and the first fibronectin type III domain) and the D2-D3 extracellular domains of FGFR1. In contrast, anosmin-1 binds to FGFR2IIIc with much lower affinity and displays negligible binding to FGFR3IIIc. We also show that FGFR1-bound anosmin-1, although capable of binding to FGF2 alone, cannot bind to a FGF2.heparin complex, thus preventing FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex formation. By contrast, heparin-bound anosmin-1 binds to pre-formed FGF2.FGFR1 complex, generating an anosmin-1.FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex. Furthermore, a functional interaction between anosmin-1 and the FGFR1 signaling complex is demonstrated by immunofluorescence co-localization and Transwell migration assays where anosmin-1 was shown to induce opposing effects during chemotaxis of human neuronal cells.

These structurally diverse ligands specifically interact directly with recombinant human ALXR demonstrated by specific radioligand binding and function as well as immunoprecipitation of PMN receptors. In addition, the combination of both ATL and ANXA1-derived peptides limited PMN infiltration and reduced production of inflammatory mediators (that is, prostaglandins and chemokines) in vivo.

To translate these findings in in vivo settings, we have used an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) procedure to promote leukocyte-endothelium interactions in the mouse mesenteric microcirculation. In naive mice, the annexin 1 mimetic peptide Ac2-26 (20 to 100 microg administered intravenously prior to reperfusion) abolished I/R-induced cell adhesion and emigration, but not cell rolling. In FPR-deficient mice, peptide Ac2-26 retained significant inhibitory actions (about 50% of the effects in naive mice), and these were blocked by an FPR antagonist, termed butyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe, or Boc2. In vitro, neutrophils taken from these animals could be activated at high concentrations of formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (30 microM; fMLP), and this effect was blocked by cell incubation with peptide Ac2-26 (66 microM) or Boc2 (100 microM). FPR-deficient neutrophils expressed ALXR mRNA and protein. Both ALXR agonists, lipoxin A(4) and peptide Ac2-26, provoked detachment of adherent leukocytes in naive as well as in FPR-deficient mice, whereas the CXC chemokine KC or fMLP were inactive.

Analysis of the effects of ANXA1 and Ac2-26 on PMN adhesion molecule expression supported the flow chamber results, with Ac2-26 but not ANXA1 causing l-selectin and PSGL-1 shedding. ANXA1 and its peptide act via the FPR family of receptors. This was corroborated using HEK-293 cells transfected with FPR or FPRL-1/ALX (the 2 members of this family expressed by human PMNs).

Finally, blockade of FPRL-1/ALX with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody was found to abrogate the effects of ANXA1 in the flow chamber but was without effect on Ac2-26-mediated inhibition of rolling.

Addition of ELA to HEK293 cells over-expressing GFP-AJP fusion protein resulted in rapid internalization of the fusion receptor. In Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells over-expressing human APJ, ELA suppresses cAMP production with EC50 of 11.1\\u2005nM, stimulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation with EC50 of 14.3\\u2005nM and weakly induces intracellular calcium mobilization. Finally, we tested ELA biological function in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and showed that ELA induces angiogenesis and relaxes mouse aortic blood vessel in a dose-dependent manner through a mechanism different from apelin. Collectively, we demonstrate that the ELA-AJP signaling pathways are functional in mammalian systems, indicating that ELA likely serves as a hormone regulating the circulation system in adulthood as well as in embryonic development.',\n",
       "   'The G protein-coupled apelin receptor regulates important processes of the cardiovascular homeostasis, including cardiac development, cardiac contractility, and vascular tone. Most recently, a novel endogenous peptide ligand for the apelin receptor was identified in zebrafish, and it was named apela/elabela/toddler. The peptide was originally considered as an exclusively embryonic regulator, and so far its function in the adult organism remains elusive. We show here that apela is predominantly expressed in the non-cardiomyocyte fraction in the adult rodent heart. We also provide evidence that apela binds to apelin receptors in the heart. Using isolated adult rat hearts, we demonstrate, that just like the fellow receptor agonist apelin, apela increases cardiac contractility and induces coronary vasodilation already in the nanomolar level. The inotropic effect, as revealed by Western blot analysis, is accompanied by a significant increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 activation markedly attenuates the apela-induced inotropy. Analysis of samples from infarcted mouse hearts showed that expression of both apela and apelin receptor is induced in failing mouse hearts and correlate with left ventricular ejection fraction. Hence, we conclude that apela is present in the adult heart, is upregulated in post-infarction cardiac remodeling, and increases cardiac contractility in an ERK1/2-dependent manner.',\n",

These responses were almost completely inhibited by a specific inhibitor for G(i) or that for Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. (125)I -Labeled [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 analogue specifically bound to APJ with a high affinity, and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 was more potent than apelin-36 in competitive inhibition assays. Because pretreatment with apelin-36 but not [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 drastically reduced the binding of the labeled apelin to APJ, the different patterns of acidification induced by these two peptides appeared to reflect their dissociation rather than association with APJ. Apelin elicited the migration of APJ-expressing cells, and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 was more potent than apelin-36 in this activity. Heterogeneous molecular forms of apelin corresponding to apelin-36 and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 were produced in bovine colostrum.

The expression levels of apelin mRNA and ir-apelin seemed to be consistent among tissues: they were highly expressed in the lung and mammary gland. By the combination of gel filtration and EIA, we found that the molecular forms of apelin differ among respective tissues: apelin molecules with sizes close to apelin-36 (long forms) were major components in the lung, testis, and uterus, but both long and short (whose sizes were close to [<Glu(65)]apelin-13) forms were detected in the mammary gland. In Scatchard analyses, the radioiodinated apelin-36 analogue bound to the receptor, APJ, with high affinity.

However, little is known about the physiological roles of this ligand-receptor pairing. In the present study we investigated the pharmacology of several apelin analogues at the human recombinant APJ receptor using radioligand binding and functional assays. This has led to the identification of key residues in the apelin peptide required for functional potency and binding affinity through structure-activity studies. In particular, we have identified that replacement of leucine in position 5, or arginine in position 2 and 4 of the C-terminal apelin peptide, apelin-13, resulted in significant changes in pharmacology. We also investigated the detailed localization of pre-proapelin and APJ receptor mRNA in a wide range of human, rat and mouse tissues using quantitative RT-PCR, and carried out a detailed immunohistochemical study of the distribution of the APJ receptor in rat brain and spinal cord. Interestingly, the APJ receptor was not only co-localized in white matter with GFAP in the spinal cord, but was also clearly localized on neurones in the brain, suggesting that this receptor and its peptide may be involved in a wide range of biological process yet to be determined.',\n",

Studies with animal models suggested that APJ and apelin play an important role in the hypothalamic regulation of water intake and the endocrine axis, in the regulation of blood pressure, and in cardiac contractility. Apelin has been found to block the activity of APJ as a human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) coreceptor. In this study, we combined chemical synthetic approaches with alanine substitution to evaluate the structural requirements for interactions with the APJ receptor. We demonstrated that apelin peptides in aqueous solution adopt a random conformation, and the positive charge and hydrophobic residues of apelin-13 play important roles in interactions with the APJ receptor. We have observed an important correlation between receptor binding affinity and cell-cell fusion inhibitory activity. The elucidation of structural requirements of apelin-13 in its interaction with the APJ receptor is critical for further investigation of apelin-APJ functions in vivo and in the design of small molecular inhibitors for potential treatment of HIV-1 infection in the CNS.',\n",
       "   'Apelin is a novel neuropeptide involved in the regulation of body fluid homeostasis and cardiovascular functions. It acts through a G protein-coupled receptor, the APJ receptor. We studied the structure-activity relationships of apelin at the rat apelin receptor, tagged at its C-terminal end with enhanced green fluorescent protein and stably expressed in CHO cells. We evaluated the potency of N- and C-terminal deleted fragments of K17F to bind with high affinity to the apelin receptor, and to inhibit cAMP production and to induce apelin receptor internalization. We first characterized the internalization and trafficking of the rat apelin receptor. This receptor was internalized via a clathrin-dependent mechanism and our results suggest that receptor trafficking may follow a recycling pathway. We then tried to identify the amino acids of K17F required for apelin activity. The first five N-terminal and the last two C-terminal amino acids of K17F were not essential for apelin binding or the inhibition of cAMP production. However, the full-length sequence of K17F was the most potent inducer of apelin receptor internalization because successive N-terminal amino-acid deletions progressively reduced internalization and the removal of a single amino acid at the C-terminus abolished this process. Finally, the most novel observation of this work is that hypotensive actions of apelin peptides correlate best with the ability of those ligands to internalize. Thus, apelin receptor signaling and endocytosis are functionally dissociated, possibly reflecting the existence of several conformational states of this receptor, stabilized by the binding of different apelin fragments to the apelin receptor.',\n",

By monitoring this activity, we isolated an APJ receptor ligand, designated apelin, from bovine stomach extracts. The structures of bovine and human apelin preproproteins were deduced from the sequences of the corresponding cDNAs. The preproproteins consisted of 77 amino acid residues, and the apelin sequence was encoded in the C-terminal regions. Synthetic peptides derived from the C-terminal amino acid sequence of bovine preproapelin were capable of specifically promoting the acidification rate in the cells expressing the APJ receptor in a range from 10(-7) to 10(-10) M, indicating that apelin is an endogenous ligand for the APJ receptor.']},\n",

To investigate the structural requirements for the cellular cholesterol efflux mediated by ABCA1, we have determined the topology of these two domains and generated transporters harboring five naturally occurring missense mutations in them. These mutants, unlike wild type ABCA1, produced little or no apoA-I-stimulated cholesterol efflux when transfected into 293 cells, establishing their causality in Tangier disease. Because all five mutant proteins were well expressed and detectable on the plasma membrane, their interaction with the ABCA1 ligand, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, was measured using bifunctional cross-linking agents. Four of five mutants had a marked decline in cross-linking to apoA-I, whereas one (W590S) retained full cross-linking activity. Cross-linking of apoA-I was temperature-dependent, rapid in onset, and detectable with both lipid- and water-soluble cross-linking agents. These results suggest that apoA-I-stimulated cholesterol efflux cannot occur without a direct interaction between the apoprotein and critical residues in two extracellular loops of ABCA1. The behavior of the W590S mutant indicates that although binding of apoA-I by ABCA1 may be necessary, it is not sufficient for stimulation of cholesterol efflux.',\n",

We show here that phosphorylation of ABCA1 in HEK293 cells was reduced by 63 +/- 2.4% after removal of the PEST sequence (ABCA1delPEST) or by incubation of cells with apoAI (58 +/- 3.3%). By contrast, ABCA1delPEST showed no further decrease of phosphorylation upon apoAI treatment. To assess the hypothesis that PEST sequence phosphorylation could regulate ABCA1 calpain proteolysis, we mutagenized S/T residues in the PEST sequence and identified Thr-1286 and Thr-1305 as constitutively phosphorylated residues. The ABCA1-T1286A/T1305A mutant was not degraded by calpain and was not further stabilized upon apoA-I treatment. The T1286A/T1305A mutant showed a 3.1-fold increase in cell surface expression and a 2.3-fold increase of apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux compared with wild type ABCA1. In conclusion, we propose a mechanism of regulation of ABCA1 cell surface expression and function in which the interaction with apoA-I results in dephosphorylation of the ABCA1 PEST sequence and thereby inhibits calpain degradation leading to an increase of ABCA1 cell surface expression.',\n",

HDL is thought to partly protect individuals from atherosclerosis due to its ability to remove excess cholesterol and act as an antioxidant.

In male mice, transiently increasing the levels of HDL reduced the acute deposition of fluorescently labeled LDL in the atheroprone inner curvature of the aorta. Reduced LDL deposition was also observed when increasing circulating wild-type APOA1 or the APOA1-Milano variant, with a more robust inhibition from the APOA1-Milano.

While only the C-terminal EGF module contains the consensus sequence associated with calcium binding, a noncanonical calcium binding site in the N-terminal domain has been revealed using solution NMR spectroscopy. The calcium dissociation constants for the N- and C-terminal sites have been measured under physiologically relevant pH and ionic strength conditions using a combination of solution NMR, intrinsic protein fluorescence, and chromophoric chelator methods to be approximately 50 microM and approximately 10-20 microM, respectively. Identification of the novel calcium binding motif in LDLR sequences from other species suggests that it may confer specificity within the LDLR gene family. Comparison of the K(d) for the C-terminal site with the calcium concentration in late vesicles indicates that the binding properties of this module may be tuned to titrate upon endocytosis of the LDL receptor-ligand complex, and thus calcium binding may play a role in the ligand dissociation process.',\n",

However, the cellular localization of LRP6 in the mutant cells shifted from cell surface to late endosomes/lysosomes. Plasma membrane expression levels of LRP6(R611C) was lower compared to wild-type receptor and declined to a greater extent in LDL-rich medium. Further examinations revealed lower efficacy of apolipoprotein B dissociation from LRP6(R611C) compared to wild-type receptor at an acidic pH. These studies identify LRP6 as a receptor for LDL endocytosis and imply that R611C mutation results in reduced LRP6 membrane expression and decreased LDL clearance.

These findings indicate that the endogenous apoE participates in the release of previously synthesized cholesterol but not newly synthesized one. Whereas, exogenously added human apoE induced release of both newly synthesized and previously synthesized cholesterols to generate apoE/HDL with lower density, suggesting that the cellular pool of cholesterol released by endogenous and exogenous apoE is different. The endogenous apoE was distributed in the caveolin-1-rich domain along with ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) in the membrane fraction and immuno-precipitated using an anti-ABCA1 antibody.

Using different APOE transgenic mice, including mice with ablation and/or inhibition of cyclophilin A (CypA), here we show that expression of APOE4 and lack of murine Apoe, but not APOE2 and APOE3, leads to BBB breakdown by activating a proinflammatory CypA-nuclear factor-ÎºB-matrix-metalloproteinase-9 pathway in pericytes.

Chylomicrons formed in the intestinal mucosa during the absorption of the products of digestion, are processed by the peripheral circulation by lipoprotein lipase, which catalyses the breakdown of triglycerides in chylomicrons to free fatty acids and glycerol. The resulting chylomicron remnants, which are cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, are subsequently taken up in the liver. A second distinct protein that binds to apo E-containing lipoproteins, but not to LDL, has been proposed to be the receptor mediating the clearance of chylomicron remnants from the plasma.

In this work, surface plasmon resonance analysis was employed to investigate how amphipathic alpha-helix properties and basic residue organization in this region modulate binding of apoE to heparin. The apoE/heparin interaction involves a two-step process; apoE initially binds to heparin with fast association and dissociation rates, followed by a step exhibiting much slower kinetics. Circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance experiments using a disulfide-linked mutant, in which opening of the N-terminal helix bundle was prevented, demonstrated that there is no major secondary or tertiary structural change in apoE upon heparin binding. Mutations of Lys-146, a key residue for the heparin interaction, greatly reduced the favorable free energy of binding of the first step without affecting the second step, suggesting that electrostatic interaction is involved in the first binding step. Although lipid-free apoE2 tended to bind less than apoE3 and apoE4, there were no significant differences in rate and equilibrium constants of binding among the apoE isoforms in the lipidated state. Discoidal apoE3-phospholipid complexes using a substitution mutant (K143R/K146R) showed similar binding affinity to wild type apoE3, indicating that basic residue specificity is not required for the effective binding of apoE to heparin, unlike its binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor. In addition, disruption of the alpha-helix structure in the apoE heparin binding region led to an increased favorable free energy of binding in the second step, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions contribute to the second binding step.

These discoveries have re-ignited interest in the role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. TREM2 is highly expressed in microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. Along with its adaptor protein, DAP12, TREM2 regulates inflammatory cytokine release and phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons. Here, we report apolipoprotein E (apoE) as a novel ligand for TREM2. Using a biochemical assay, we demonstrated high-affinity binding of apoE to human TREM2. The functional significance of this binding was highlighted by increased phagocytosis of apoE-bound apoptotic N2a cells by primary microglia in a manner that depends on TREM2 expression. Moreover, when the AD-associated TREM2-R47H mutant was used in biochemical assays, apoE binding was vastly reduced. Our data demonstrate that apoE-TREM2 interaction in microglia plays critical roles in modulating phagocytosis of apoE-bound apoptotic neurons and establish a critical link between two proteins whose genes are strongly linked to the risk for AD.',\n",

Binding of these ligands by TREM2 was abolished or reduced by disease-associated mutations. Overexpression of wild-type TREM2 was sufficient to enhance uptake of LDL, CLU, and APOE in heterologous cells, whereas TREM2 disease variants were impaired in this activity. Trem2 knockout microglia showed reduced internalization of LDL and CLU. Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) binds to lipoproteins and this complex is efficiently taken up by microglia in a TREM2-dependent fashion. Uptake of AÎ²-lipoprotein complexes was reduced in macrophages from human subjects carrying a TREM2 AD variant.

In the adult brain, Reelin is expressed by GABA-ergic interneurons, suggesting a potential function as a modulator of neurotransmission. ApoE receptors have been indirectly implicated in memory and neurodegenerative disorders because their ligand, apoE, is genetically associated with Alzheimer disease. We have used knockout mice to investigate the role of Reelin and its receptors in cognition and synaptic plasticity. Mice lacking either the VLDL receptor or the apoER2 show contextual fear conditioning deficits. VLDL receptor-deficient mice also have a moderate defect in long term potentiation (LTP), and apoER2 knockouts have a pronounced one. The perfusion of mouse hippocampal slices with Reelin has no effect on baseline synaptic transmission but significantly enhances LTP in area CA1. This Reelin-dependent augmentation of LTP is abolished in VLDL receptor and apoER2 knockout mice. Our results reveal a role for Reelin in controlling synaptic plasticity in the adult brain and suggest that both of its receptors are necessary for Reelin-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Thus, the impairment of apoE receptor-dependent neuromodulation may contribute to cognitive impairment and synaptic loss in Alzheimer disease.']},\n",

Here we provide three lines of evidence that the phagocyte G protein-coupled receptor (N-formylpeptide receptor 2 (FPR2)) mediates these amyloid-beta-dependent functions in phagocytic cells. First, transfection of FPR2, but not related receptors, including the other known N-formylpeptide receptor FPR, reconstituted amyloid-beta-dependent chemotaxis and calcium flux in HEK 293 cells. Second, amyloid-beta induced both calcium flux and chemotaxis in mouse neutrophils (which express endogenous FPR2) with similar potency as in FPR2-transfected HEK 293 cells. This activity could be specifically desensitized in both cell types by preincubation with a specific FPR2 agonist, which desensitizes the receptor, or with pertussis toxin, which uncouples it from G(i)-dependent signaling. Third, specific and reciprocal desensitization of superoxide production was observed when N-formylpeptides and amyloid-beta were used to sequentially stimulate neutrophils from FPR -/- mice, which express FPR2 normally. Potential biological relevance of these results to the neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease was suggested by two additional findings: first, FPR2 mRNA could be detected by PCR in mouse brain; second, induction of FPR2 expression correlated with induction of calcium flux and chemotaxis by amyloid-beta in the mouse microglial cell line N9. Further, in sequential stimulation experiments with N9 cells, N-formylpeptides and amyloid-beta were able to reciprocally cross-desensitize each other.

EGFR truncation had no significant effect on AR binding to receptor but did result in defective GRB2 adaptor function.

Therefore, we have assessed the stimulation of erbB family receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by these hormones in a panel of mouse Ba/F3 cell lines expressing the four erbB family receptors, singly and in pairwise combinations. We also measured the stimulation of interleukin-3-independent survival or proliferation in this panel of Ba/F3 cell lines to compare the patterns of erbB family receptor coupling to physiologic responses induced by these peptides. EGF, TGF-alpha, AR, and HB-EGF all stimulated qualitatively similar patterns of erbB family receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and coupling to physiologic responses. Therefore, EGF, TGF-alpha, AR, and HB-EGF are functionally identical in this model system and behave differently from the EGF family hormones betacellulin and neuregulins.']},\n",

       "   'Despite their opposite effects on signal transduction, the nonapeptide hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and its V1a receptor-selective cyclic peptide antagonist d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP display homologous primary structures, differing only at residues 1 and 2. These structural similarities led us to hypothesize that both ligands could interact with the same binding pocket in the V1a receptor. To determine receptor residues responsible for discriminating binding of agonist and antagonist ligands, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of conserved aromatic and hydrophilic residues as well as nonconserved residues, all located in the transmembrane binding pocket of the V1a receptor. Mutation of aromatic residues of transmembrane region VI (W304, F307, F308) reduced affinity for the d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP and markedly decreased affinity for the unrelated strongly hydrophobic V1a-selective nonpeptide antagonist SR 49059. Replacement of these aromatic residues had no effect on AVP binding, but increased AVP-induced coupling efficacy of the receptor for its G protein. Mutating hydrophilic residues Q108, K128 and Q185 in transmembrane regions II, III and IV, respectively, led to a decrease in affinity for both agonists and antagonists. Finally, the nonconserved residues T333 and A334 in transmembrane region VII, controlled the V1a/V2 binding selectivity for both nonpeptide and cyclic peptide antagonists. Thus, because conserved aromatic residues of the V1a receptor binding pocket seem essential for antagonists and do not contribute at all to the binding of agonists, we propose that these residues differentiate agonist vs. antagonist ligand binding.',\n",

Binding experiments performed on various membrane preparations revealed that d[Cha(4)]AVP exhibits a nanomolar affinity for V1b receptors from various mammalian species (rat, bovine, human). It exhibits high V1b/V1a and V1b/oxytocin selectivity for rat, human, and bovine receptors. Furthermore, it exhibits high V1b/V2 specificity for both bovine and human vasopressin receptors. Functional studies performed on biological models that naturally express V1b receptors indicate that d[Cha4]AVP is an agonist. Like VP, it stimulated basal and corticotropin-releasing factor-stimulated ACTH secretion and basal catecholamine release from rat anterior pituitary and bovine chromaffin cells, respectively. In vivo experiments performed in rat revealed that d[Cha4]AVP was able to stimulate both ACTH and corticosterone secretion and exhibits negligible vasopressor activity. It retains about 30% of the antidiuretic activity of VP.

All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods using BOC chemistry for all but one peptide (8), which required the use of Fmoc chemistry. The binding and functional properties of these position 4 substituted analogues of dAVP (d[X(4)]AVP) and the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP (Derick et al. Endocrinology 2002, 143, 4655-4664) were evaluated on human arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1a), V(1b), and V(2) receptors and on the human oxytocin (OT) receptor expressed in living Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Binding studies revealed that broad modifications of the fourth residue of dAVP do not significantly alter affinity for the human V(1b) receptor. Only aromatic (Phe, Tyr, Trp) or negatively charged (Glu) residues reduce V(1b) affinity. By contrast, the human V(1a) and more particularly the human V(2) and the OT receptors are more sensitive to many of these modifications. Thus, the replacement of the Gln(4) residue of dAVP by aliphatic (Leu, Cha) or positively charged (Orn, Lys, Arg, Har) amino acids led to analogues exhibiting drastic reductions of their affinity for the human V(1a), V(2), and OT receptors. Consequently, in addition to the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP, peptides 6 and 17-20 display excellent selectivities for the human V(1b) receptor. The key structural requirement responsible for optimal V(1b) selectivity appears to be the length and branching of the aliphatic side chain of the fourth residue of dAVP. Functional studies performed on CHO cells expressing the different human AVP/OT receptors confirm the V(1b) selectivity of peptides 6, 17, 18, 20, and d[Cha(4)]AVP. However, d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), which triggers an excellent coupling between the human V(2) receptor and adenylyl cyclase, was found to exhibit both V(1b) and V(2) agonism in functional tests. More interestingly, these functional experiments revealed that, depending on the AVP/OT receptor, a given d[X(4)]AVP analogue may behave as a full agonist or as a partial agonist. This strongly suggests that the fourth residue of dAVP plays an important role in the coupling between the hormone-receptor complex, the heterotrimeric G protein, and the effectors. In conclusion, the synthesis of these d[X(4)]AVP analogues led to the discovery of new V(1b) agonists with high affinity and greatly enhanced selectivities. Thus, in addition to d[Cha(4)]AVP, d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), and d[Har(4)]AVP (20) are useful new tools for studying the structure and the function of the human V(1b) receptor.',\n",

SSR149415 showed pK(i) values of 9.34+/-0.06 at hV(1b) and 8.82+/-0.16 at hOT receptors. 3 d[Cha(4)]AVP stimulated [Ca(2+)](i) increase in hV(1b)-CHO cells with a pEC(50) value of 10.05+/-0.15. It showed pEC(50) values of 6.53+/-0.17 and 5.92+/-0.02 at hV(1a) and hV(2) receptors, respectively, and behaved as a weak antagonist at hOT receptors (pK(B)=6.31+/-0.12). SSR149415 inhibited the agonist-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase with pK(B) values of 9.19+/-0.07 in hV(1b)-CHO and 8.72+/-0.15 in hOT-CHO cells. A functional pK(i) value of 7.23+/-0.10 was found for SSR1494151 at hV(1a) receptors, whereas it did not inhibit 20 nM AVP response at hV(2) receptors up to 3 microM. 4 Data obtained confirmed the high potency and selectivity of d[Cha(4)]AVP at hV(1b) receptors, but revealed that SSR149415, in addition to the high potency at hV(1b) receptors, displays a significant antagonism at hOT receptors.',\n",
       "   'Vasopressin (AVP), the antidiuretic hormone, is a cyclic nonapeptide that acts through binding to G protein-coupled specific membrane receptors pharmacologically divided into three subtypes (V1a, V1b, and V2) linked to distinct second messengers. Within the family of human AVP receptors, the V2 AVP receptor has been cloned, but the structure of the human V1a and V1b AVP receptors remains unknown. We report here the structure and functional expression of a human V1a AVP receptor complementary DNA isolated from human liver cDNA libraries. Cloning and sequencing of a full-length clone isolated a 1472-nucleotide sequence encoding a 418-amino acid polypeptide with seven putative transmembrane domains typical of G protein-coupled receptors. Amino acid sequence identity with the rat liver V1a AVP receptor, the human and rat V2 AVP receptors, and the human oxytocin receptor was 72, 36, 37, and 45%, respectively. Functional characterization of the cloned receptor was done by transient expression in COS-7 cells and stable expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Localization of the expressed receptor at the cellular surface was illustrated by using the fluorescent linear analog phenylacetyl-D-Tyr(Et)-Phe-Gln-Asn-Lys-Pro-Arg-NH2 coupled to fluorescein-avidin by dodecabiotin. Competition binding experiments with phenylacetyl-D-Tyr(Et)-Phe-Val-Asn-Lys-Pro-[125I]Tyr-NH2 and AVP analogs revealed high affinity specific binding sites of the V1a subtype. Saturation binding experiments with [3H]AVP confirmed the presence of a single class of high affinity binding sites. Measurement of AVP-induced inositol phosphate production and calcium mobilization confirmed that the expressed V1a AVP receptor is coupled to phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. Thus, the human V1a AVP receptor belongs to the superfamily of seven-transmembrane segment receptors with a significant sequence identity with the other members of the AVP-oxytocin family of receptors.',\n",
       "   '1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) is considered a standard vasopressin V2 receptor-selective agonist with a potent antidiuretic effect through V2 receptor without the induction of vasoconstriction through V1a receptor. Furthermore, DDAVP was reported to act as an agonist on non-V1a, non-V2 receptor to cause the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ in several tissues. However, the agonistic activity of DDAVP against the other vasopressin receptor, V1b (or V3), which can accumulate intracellular Ca2+ and which we recently cloned, has not been clarified. Hence, we compared the characteristics of DDAVP on V1b receptor with those on the other vasopressin receptors. In binding experiments, DDAVP more strongly inhibited [3H]arginine vasopressin binding to V1b than to V2 receptor (Ki: 5.84 nM vs 65.9 nM). In addition, DDAVP dose-dependently stimulated inositol turnover in human V1b receptor-expressing COS-1 cells. DDAVP acted as a full agonist on human V1b receptor (EC50: 11.4 nM) as well as on human V2 receptor (EC50: 23.9 nM). However, DDAVP behaved as a partial agonist toward rat V1b receptor (intrinsic activity: 0.7, EC50: 43.5 nM), while there was no significant difference in the agonistic properties of arginine vasopressin on human and rat V1b receptor. In conclusion, DDAVP acts as an agonist on V1b receptor, as it does on V2 receptor. These findings will allow us to better understand the physiological role of V1b receptor in pancreatic beta cells and in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, and help us to identify as yet unknown vasopressin receptors through which DDAVP cause the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ in other tissues.',\n",
       "   'The vasopressin (AVP) V3 pituitary receptor (V3R) is a G protein-coupled corticotropic phenotypic marker that is overexpressed in ACTH-hypersecreting tumors. Studies of the agonist/antagonist binding profile and signal transduction pathways linked to the human V3R have been limited because of the scarcity of this protein. To define the signals activated by V3Rs and the eventual changes triggered by developmental or pathological receptor regulation, we developed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-V3 cells stably expressing low, medium, or high levels of human V3Rs (binding capacity, <10, 10-25, and 25-100 pmol/mg, respectively). The affinity of the V3R for 21 peptide and nonpeptide AVP analogs was clearly distinct from that exhibited by the human V1R and V2R. AVP triggered stimulation of phospholipase C in CHO-V3 cells (partially sensitive to treatment with pertussis toxin) with a potency directly proportional to receptor density. V3R-mediated arachidonic acid release also was also sensitive to pertussis toxin and more efficacious in cells exhibiting medium than in those with high receptor density. AVP also stimulated the pertussis toxin-insensitive uptake of [3H]thymidine in CHO-V3 cells. The concentration-response curves for this effect were monophasic in cells expressing low and medium levels of V3Rs; on the contrary, a biphasic curve was observed in cells with high V3R density. Coupling of V3R to increased production of cAMP was only observed in CHOV3 high cells, suggesting a negative relationship between increased cAMP production and DNA synthesis. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by V3R was pertussis toxin insensitive, but was dependent on activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C; both the level and duration of activation were a function of the receptor density. Thus, the human V3R has a pharmacological profile clearly distinct from that of the human V1R and V2R and activates several signaling pathways via different G proteins, depending on the level of receptor expression. The increased synthesis of DNA and cAMP levels observed in cells expressing medium and high levels of V3Rs, respectively, may represent important events in the tumorigenesis of corticotroph cells.',\n",
       "   'The study of antagonist-binding domains of the human V1a vasopressin receptor was performed using a radioiodinated photoreactive peptide antagonist. This ligand displayed a high affinity for the receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes, and specifically labeled two protein bands with apparent molecular mass at 85-90 and 46 kDa. Our results clearly show that the V1a receptor is degraded during incubation with the ligand and that the 46-kDa species is probably the result of the 85-90-kDa species proteolytic cleavage. Truncation of the receptor was then confirmed by deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F. A monoclonal antibody directed against a c-Myc epitope added at the receptor NH2 terminus allowed immunoprecipitation of the 85-90-kDa photolabeled species. The 46-kDa photolabeled protein never immunoprecipitated, indicating that the truncated form of the receptor lacks the NH2 terminus region. To localize photolabeled domains of the receptor, the 46-kDa protein was cleaved with V8 and/or Lys-C endoproteinases. The identity of the smallest photolabeled fragment, observed at approximately 6 kDa, was then confirmed by mutation of the potential V8 cleavage sites. Our results indicate that covalent labeling of the vasopressin V1a receptor with the photoreactive antagonist occurs in a region including transmembrane domain VII (residues Asn327-Lys370).',\n",

Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms for the specific binding of [3H]AVP to membranes, prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with human V1A, V1B and V2 receptors, yielded an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.67 nM, 0.28 nM and 2.14 nM and a maximum receptor density (Bmax) of 2180 fmol/mg protein, 369 fmol/mg protein and 2660 fmol/mg protein, respectively. YM087 showed high affinity for AVP V1A and V2 receptors with Ki values of 6.3 and 1.1 nM, respectively, but had no effect on [3H]AVP binding to AVP V1B receptors. In COS-1 cells expressing either AVP V1A or V1B receptors, AVP caused a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). YM087 inhibited the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in COS-1 cells expressing AVP V1A receptors in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 14.3 nM, but did not influence this increase in AVP V1B-receptor expressing cells. In contrast, stimulation of COS-1 cells expressing AVP V2 receptors resulted in an accumulation of cAMP. YM087 inhibited AVP-induced cAMP production in COS-1 cells expressing AVP V2 receptors in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 1.95 nM. In all assays used, YM087 was devoid of any agonistic activity. These results suggest that YM087 is a potent nonpeptide dual human AVP V1A and V2 receptor antagonist, and that YM087 will be a powerful tool in investigation of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of AVP.\",\n",
       "   'The pharmacological profile and the acute and chronic aquaretic effects of OPC-41061, a novel nonpeptide human arginine vasopressin (AVP) V2-receptor antagonist, were respectively characterized in HeLa cells expressing cloned human AVP receptors and in conscious male rats. OPC-41061 antagonized [3H]-AVP binding to human V2-receptors (Ki = 0.43 +/- 0.06 nM) more potently than AVP (Ki = 0. 78 +/- 0.08 nM) or OPC-31260 (Ki = 9.42 +/- 0.90 nM). OPC-41061 also inhibited [3H]-AVP binding to human V1a-receptors (Ki = 12.3 +/- 0.8 nM) but not to human V1b-receptors, indicating that OPC-41061 was 29 times more selective for V2-receptors than for V1a-receptors. OPC-41061 inhibited cAMP production induced by AVP with no intrinsic agonist activity. In rats, OPC-41061 inhibited [3H]-AVP binding to V1a-receptors (Ki = 325 +/- 41 nM) and V2-receptors (Ki = 1.33 +/- 0. 30 nM), showing higher receptor selectivity (V1a/V2 = 244) than with human receptors. A single oral administration of OPC-41061 in rats clearly produced dose-dependent aquaresis. In treatment by multiple OPC-41061 dosing for 28 days at 1 and 10 mg/kg p.o. in rats, significant aquaretic effects were seen throughout the study period. As the result of aquaresis, hemoconcentration was seen at 4 hr postdosing although, no differences were seen in serum osmolality, sodium, creatinine and urea nitrogen concentrations at 24 hr postdosing. Furthermore, there was no difference in serum AVP concentration, pituitary AVP content or the number and affinity of AVP receptors in the kidney and liver at trough throughout the study period. These results demonstrate that OPC-41061 is a highly potent human AVP V2-receptor antagonist and produces clear aquaresis after single and multiple dosing, suggesting the usefulness in the treatment of various water retaining states.',\n",
       "   'Three subtypes of human (h) arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptors, hV1A, hV1B and hV2, were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and characterized by [3H]-AVP binding studies. In addition, the coupling of the expressed receptor protein to a variety of signal transduction pathways was investigated. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms for the specific binding of [3H]-AVP to membranes, prepared from CHO cells transfected with hV1A, hV1B and hV2 receptors, yielded an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.39, 0.25 and 1.21 nM and a maximum receptor density (Bmax) of 1580 fmol mg(-1) protein, 5230 fmol mg(-1) protein and 7020 fmol mg(-1) protein, respectively. Hill coefficients did not differ significantly from unity, suggesting binding to homogenous, non-interacting receptor populations. Pharmacological characterization of the transfected human AVP receptors was undertaken by measuring the relative ability of nonpeptide AVP receptor antagonists, YM087, OPC-21268, OPC-31260, SR 49059 and SR 121463A, to inhibit binding of [3H]-AVP. At hV1A receptors, the relative order of potency was SR49059>YM087>OPC-31260>SR 121463A> >OPC-21268 and at hV2 receptors, YM087=SR 121463A>OPC-31260>SR 49059> >OPC-21268. In contrast, the relative order of potency, at hV1B receptors, was SR 49059> >SR 121463A=YM087=OPC-31260=OPC-21268. In CHO cells expressing either hV1A or hV1B receptors, AVP caused a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with an EC50 value of 1.13 nM and 0.90 nM, respectively. In contrast, stimulation of CHO cells expressing hV2 receptors resulted in an accumulation of cyclic AMP with an EC50 value of 2.22 nM. The potency order of antagonists in inhibiting AVP-induced [Ca2+]i or cyclic AMP response was similar to that observed in radioligand binding assays. In conclusion, we have characterized the pharmacology of human cloned V1A, V1B and V2 receptors and used these to determine the affinity, selectivity and potency of nonpeptide AVP receptor antagonists. Thus they may prove to be a valuable tool in further examination of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of AVP.']},\n",

OPC-51803 and dDAVP displaced [(3)H]-AVP binding to human V(2)- and V(1a)-receptors with K(i) values of 91.9+/-10.8 nM (n = 6) and 3.12+/-0.38 nM (n = 6) for V(2)-receptors, and 819+/-39 nM (n = 6) and 41.5+/-9.9 nM (n = 6) for V(1a)-receptors, indicating that OPC-51803 was about nine times more selective for V(2)-receptors, similar to the selectivity of dDAVP. OPC-51803 scarcely displaced [(3)H]-AVP binding to human V(1b)-receptors even at 10(-4) M, while dDAVP showed potent affinity to human V(1b)-receptors with the K(i) value of 13.7+/-3.2 nM (n = 4). OPC-51803 concentration-dependently increased cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production in HeLa cells expressing human V(2)-receptors with an EC(50) value of 189+/-14 nM (n = 6). The concentration-response curve for cyclic AMP production induced by OPC-51803 was shifted to the right in the presence of a V(2)-antagonist, OPC-31260. At 10(-5) M, OPC-51803 did not increase the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in HeLa cells expressing human V(1a)-receptors. On the other hand, dDAVP increased [Ca(2+)](i) in HeLa cells expressing human V(1a)- and V(1b)-receptors in a concentration-dependent fashion. From these results, OPC-51803 has been confirmed to be the first nonpeptide agonist for human AVP V(2)-receptors without agonistic activities for V(1a)- and V(1b)-receptors.

       "   'To date, there are no vasopressin (VP) agonists that exhibit a high affinity and selectivity for the VP V1b receptor with respect to the V1a, V2, and oxytocin receptors. In this study, we describe the synthesis and pharmacological properties of [1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] arginine vasopressin (d[Cha4]AVP). Binding experiments performed on various membrane preparations revealed that d[Cha(4)]AVP exhibits a nanomolar affinity for V1b receptors from various mammalian species (rat, bovine, human). It exhibits high V1b/V1a and V1b/oxytocin selectivity for rat, human, and bovine receptors. Furthermore, it exhibits high V1b/V2 specificity for both bovine and human vasopressin receptors. Functional studies performed on biological models that naturally express V1b receptors indicate that d[Cha4]AVP is an agonist. Like VP, it stimulated basal and corticotropin-releasing factor-stimulated ACTH secretion and basal catecholamine release from rat anterior pituitary and bovine chromaffin cells, respectively. In vivo experiments performed in rat revealed that d[Cha4]AVP was able to stimulate both ACTH and corticosterone secretion and exhibits negligible vasopressor activity. It retains about 30% of the antidiuretic activity of VP. This long-sought selective VP V1b receptor ligand with nanomolar affinity will allow a better understanding of V1b-mediated VP physiological effects and is a promising new tool for V1b receptor structure-function studies.',\n",
       "   'The glutamine(4) residue in [deamino-Cys(1)]arginine vasopressin (dAVP) was replaced by a broad series of aliphatic, aromatic, polar, and charged amino acids to give the following peptides: d[Gly(4)]AVP (1), d[Ala(4)]AVP (2), d[Abu(4)]AVP (3), d[Nva(4)]AVP (4), d[Nle(4)]AVP (5), d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Ile(4)]AVP (7), d[Thi(4)]AVP (8), d[Phe(4)]AVP (9), d[Tyr(4)]AVP (10), d[Trp(4)]AVP (11), d[Asn(4)]AVP (12), d[Ser(4)]AVP (13), d[Thr(4)]AVP (14), d[Dap(4)]AVP (15), d[Dab(4)]AVP (16), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), d[Har(4)]AVP (20), and d[Glu(4)]AVP (21). All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods using BOC chemistry for all but one peptide (8), which required the use of Fmoc chemistry. The binding and functional properties of these position 4 substituted analogues of dAVP (d[X(4)]AVP) and the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP (Derick et al. Endocrinology 2002, 143, 4655-4664) were evaluated on human arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1a), V(1b), and V(2) receptors and on the human oxytocin (OT) receptor expressed in living Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Binding studies revealed that broad modifications of the fourth residue of dAVP do not significantly alter affinity for the human V(1b) receptor. Only aromatic (Phe, Tyr, Trp) or negatively charged (Glu) residues reduce V(1b) affinity. By contrast, the human V(1a) and more particularly the human V(2) and the OT receptors are more sensitive to many of these modifications. Thus, the replacement of the Gln(4) residue of dAVP by aliphatic (Leu, Cha) or positively charged (Orn, Lys, Arg, Har) amino acids led to analogues exhibiting drastic reductions of their affinity for the human V(1a), V(2), and OT receptors. Consequently, in addition to the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP, peptides 6 and 17-20 display excellent selectivities for the human V(1b) receptor. The key structural requirement responsible for optimal V(1b) selectivity appears to be the length and branching of the aliphatic side chain of the fourth residue of dAVP. Functional studies performed on CHO cells expressing the different human AVP/OT receptors confirm the V(1b) selectivity of peptides 6, 17, 18, 20, and d[Cha(4)]AVP. However, d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), which triggers an excellent coupling between the human V(2) receptor and adenylyl cyclase, was found to exhibit both V(1b) and V(2) agonism in functional tests. More interestingly, these functional experiments revealed that, depending on the AVP/OT receptor, a given d[X(4)]AVP analogue may behave as a full agonist or as a partial agonist. This strongly suggests that the fourth residue of dAVP plays an important role in the coupling between the hormone-receptor complex, the heterotrimeric G protein, and the effectors. In conclusion, the synthesis of these d[X(4)]AVP analogues led to the discovery of new V(1b) agonists with high affinity and greatly enhanced selectivities. Thus, in addition to d[Cha(4)]AVP, d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), and d[Har(4)]AVP (20) are useful new tools for studying the structure and the function of the human V(1b) receptor.',\n",

       "   'Arginine vasopressin modulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone, beta-endorphin, and prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Release is mediated by the V1b receptor through the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. In contrast to its well characterized peripheral actions, such as antidiuresis, contraction of vascular smooth muscle, and stimulation of hepatic glycogenolysis, the exact site and mechanism of vasopressin action in the pituitary remain unclear. This is largely due to a lack of information on the molecular identity and exact localization of the V1b receptor. This lack prompted us to try to isolate this receptor subtype. Here we report the molecular cloning and functional expression of a complementary DNA encoding the human V1b receptor. The deduced 424-amino acid sequence of the receptor has highest overall homology with the V1a, V2, and oxytocin receptors, with homologies of 45, 39, and 45%, respectively. The receptor expressed in COS-1 cells has a single binding site for arginine vasopressin with a Kd of 0.17 +/- 0.04 nM. It binds various agonists and antagonists of vasopressin with affinities distinct from those of V1a and V2 receptors but consistent with those anticipated for the V1b receptor on the basis of the pharmacological studies. Furthermore, arginine vasopressin evoked calcium-dependent chloride current in Xenopus oocytes transfected with the receptor, which was not affected by a V1a/V2 antagonist. In contrast, the current evoked in oocytes transfected with V1a receptor was abolished by the antagonist. Northern blot analysis revealed that the receptor expression is restricted to the pituitary. These data clearly indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes the V1b receptor.',\n",

Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by V3R was pertussis toxin insensitive, but was dependent on activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C; both the level and duration of activation were a function of the receptor density. Thus, the human V3R has a pharmacological profile clearly distinct from that of the human V1R and V2R and activates several signaling pathways via different G proteins, depending on the level of receptor expression. The increased synthesis of DNA and cAMP levels observed in cells expressing medium and high levels of V3Rs, respectively, may represent important events in the tumorigenesis of corticotroph cells.',\n",

       "   'To date, there are no vasopressin (VP) agonists that exhibit a high affinity and selectivity for the VP V1b receptor with respect to the V1a, V2, and oxytocin receptors. In this study, we describe the synthesis and pharmacological properties of [1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] arginine vasopressin (d[Cha4]AVP). Binding experiments performed on various membrane preparations revealed that d[Cha(4)]AVP exhibits a nanomolar affinity for V1b receptors from various mammalian species (rat, bovine, human). It exhibits high V1b/V1a and V1b/oxytocin selectivity for rat, human, and bovine receptors. Furthermore, it exhibits high V1b/V2 specificity for both bovine and human vasopressin receptors. Functional studies performed on biological models that naturally express V1b receptors indicate that d[Cha4]AVP is an agonist. Like VP, it stimulated basal and corticotropin-releasing factor-stimulated ACTH secretion and basal catecholamine release from rat anterior pituitary and bovine chromaffin cells, respectively. In vivo experiments performed in rat revealed that d[Cha4]AVP was able to stimulate both ACTH and corticosterone secretion and exhibits negligible vasopressor activity. It retains about 30% of the antidiuretic activity of VP. This long-sought selective VP V1b receptor ligand with nanomolar affinity will allow a better understanding of V1b-mediated VP physiological effects and is a promising new tool for V1b receptor structure-function studies.',\n",
       "   'The glutamine(4) residue in [deamino-Cys(1)]arginine vasopressin (dAVP) was replaced by a broad series of aliphatic, aromatic, polar, and charged amino acids to give the following peptides: d[Gly(4)]AVP (1), d[Ala(4)]AVP (2), d[Abu(4)]AVP (3), d[Nva(4)]AVP (4), d[Nle(4)]AVP (5), d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Ile(4)]AVP (7), d[Thi(4)]AVP (8), d[Phe(4)]AVP (9), d[Tyr(4)]AVP (10), d[Trp(4)]AVP (11), d[Asn(4)]AVP (12), d[Ser(4)]AVP (13), d[Thr(4)]AVP (14), d[Dap(4)]AVP (15), d[Dab(4)]AVP (16), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), d[Har(4)]AVP (20), and d[Glu(4)]AVP (21). All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods using BOC chemistry for all but one peptide (8), which required the use of Fmoc chemistry. The binding and functional properties of these position 4 substituted analogues of dAVP (d[X(4)]AVP) and the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP (Derick et al. Endocrinology 2002, 143, 4655-4664) were evaluated on human arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1a), V(1b), and V(2) receptors and on the human oxytocin (OT) receptor expressed in living Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Binding studies revealed that broad modifications of the fourth residue of dAVP do not significantly alter affinity for the human V(1b) receptor. Only aromatic (Phe, Tyr, Trp) or negatively charged (Glu) residues reduce V(1b) affinity. By contrast, the human V(1a) and more particularly the human V(2) and the OT receptors are more sensitive to many of these modifications. Thus, the replacement of the Gln(4) residue of dAVP by aliphatic (Leu, Cha) or positively charged (Orn, Lys, Arg, Har) amino acids led to analogues exhibiting drastic reductions of their affinity for the human V(1a), V(2), and OT receptors. Consequently, in addition to the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP, peptides 6 and 17-20 display excellent selectivities for the human V(1b) receptor. The key structural requirement responsible for optimal V(1b) selectivity appears to be the length and branching of the aliphatic side chain of the fourth residue of dAVP. Functional studies performed on CHO cells expressing the different human AVP/OT receptors confirm the V(1b) selectivity of peptides 6, 17, 18, 20, and d[Cha(4)]AVP. However, d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), which triggers an excellent coupling between the human V(2) receptor and adenylyl cyclase, was found to exhibit both V(1b) and V(2) agonism in functional tests. More interestingly, these functional experiments revealed that, depending on the AVP/OT receptor, a given d[X(4)]AVP analogue may behave as a full agonist or as a partial agonist. This strongly suggests that the fourth residue of dAVP plays an important role in the coupling between the hormone-receptor complex, the heterotrimeric G protein, and the effectors. In conclusion, the synthesis of these d[X(4)]AVP analogues led to the discovery of new V(1b) agonists with high affinity and greatly enhanced selectivities. Thus, in addition to d[Cha(4)]AVP, d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), and d[Har(4)]AVP (20) are useful new tools for studying the structure and the function of the human V(1b) receptor.',\n",
       "   '1 A possible role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1b) receptor subtype in stress-related disorders has been recently highlighted by the discovery of the agonist [1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] AVP (d[Cha(4)]AVP) and the antagonist SSR149415. Both compounds have been proposed to target specifically V(1b) receptors, since the reported affinities for the related V(1a), V(2) and oxytocin receptors are in the micromolar or submicromolar range. In the present study, we further investigated the binding affinities of d[Cha(4)]AVP and SSR149415 at recombinant human vasopressin V(1b) (hV(1b)) and oxytocin (hOT) receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and functional properties of both compounds at hV(1b), hV(1a), hV(2) and hOT receptors. 2 d[Cha(4)]AVP bound to hV(1b) receptors and hOT receptors with pK(i) values of 9.68+/-0.06 and 7.68+/-0.09, respectively. SSR149415 showed pK(i) values of 9.34+/-0.06 at hV(1b) and 8.82+/-0.16 at hOT receptors. 3 d[Cha(4)]AVP stimulated [Ca(2+)](i) increase in hV(1b)-CHO cells with a pEC(50) value of 10.05+/-0.15. It showed pEC(50) values of 6.53+/-0.17 and 5.92+/-0.02 at hV(1a) and hV(2) receptors, respectively, and behaved as a weak antagonist at hOT receptors (pK(B)=6.31+/-0.12). SSR149415 inhibited the agonist-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase with pK(B) values of 9.19+/-0.07 in hV(1b)-CHO and 8.72+/-0.15 in hOT-CHO cells. A functional pK(i) value of 7.23+/-0.10 was found for SSR1494151 at hV(1a) receptors, whereas it did not inhibit 20 nM AVP response at hV(2) receptors up to 3 microM. 4 Data obtained confirmed the high potency and selectivity of d[Cha(4)]AVP at hV(1b) receptors, but revealed that SSR149415, in addition to the high potency at hV(1b) receptors, displays a significant antagonism at hOT receptors.',\n",
       "   'Using a three-dimensional model of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), we have previously succeeded in docking the neurohypophysial hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) into the V1a receptor. According to this model, the hormone is completely embedded in the transmembrane part of the receptor. Only the side chain of the Arg residue at position 8 projects outside the transmembrane core of the receptor and possibly interacts with a Tyr residue located in the first extracellular loop at position 115. Residue 8 varies in the two natural neurohypophysial hormones, AVP and oxytocin (OT); similarly, different residues are present at position 115 in the different members of the AVP/OT receptor family. Here we show that Arg8 is crucial for high affinity binding of AVP to the rat V1a receptor. Moreover, when Tyr115 is replaced by an Asp and a Phe, the amino acids naturally occurring in the V2 and in the OT receptor subtypes, the agonist selectivity of the V1a receptor switches accordingly. Our results indicate that the interaction between peptide residue 8 and the receptor residue at position 115 is not only crucial for agonist high affinity binding but also for receptor selectivity.',\n",
       "   '1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) is considered a standard vasopressin V2 receptor-selective agonist with a potent antidiuretic effect through V2 receptor without the induction of vasoconstriction through V1a receptor. Furthermore, DDAVP was reported to act as an agonist on non-V1a, non-V2 receptor to cause the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ in several tissues. However, the agonistic activity of DDAVP against the other vasopressin receptor, V1b (or V3), which can accumulate intracellular Ca2+ and which we recently cloned, has not been clarified. Hence, we compared the characteristics of DDAVP on V1b receptor with those on the other vasopressin receptors. In binding experiments, DDAVP more strongly inhibited [3H]arginine vasopressin binding to V1b than to V2 receptor (Ki: 5.84 nM vs 65.9 nM). In addition, DDAVP dose-dependently stimulated inositol turnover in human V1b receptor-expressing COS-1 cells. DDAVP acted as a full agonist on human V1b receptor (EC50: 11.4 nM) as well as on human V2 receptor (EC50: 23.9 nM). However, DDAVP behaved as a partial agonist toward rat V1b receptor (intrinsic activity: 0.7, EC50: 43.5 nM), while there was no significant difference in the agonistic properties of arginine vasopressin on human and rat V1b receptor. In conclusion, DDAVP acts as an agonist on V1b receptor, as it does on V2 receptor. These findings will allow us to better understand the physiological role of V1b receptor in pancreatic beta cells and in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, and help us to identify as yet unknown vasopressin receptors through which DDAVP cause the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ in other tissues.',\n",
       "   'The vasopressin (AVP) V3 pituitary receptor (V3R) is a G protein-coupled corticotropic phenotypic marker that is overexpressed in ACTH-hypersecreting tumors. Studies of the agonist/antagonist binding profile and signal transduction pathways linked to the human V3R have been limited because of the scarcity of this protein. To define the signals activated by V3Rs and the eventual changes triggered by developmental or pathological receptor regulation, we developed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-V3 cells stably expressing low, medium, or high levels of human V3Rs (binding capacity, <10, 10-25, and 25-100 pmol/mg, respectively). The affinity of the V3R for 21 peptide and nonpeptide AVP analogs was clearly distinct from that exhibited by the human V1R and V2R. AVP triggered stimulation of phospholipase C in CHO-V3 cells (partially sensitive to treatment with pertussis toxin) with a potency directly proportional to receptor density. V3R-mediated arachidonic acid release also was also sensitive to pertussis toxin and more efficacious in cells exhibiting medium than in those with high receptor density. AVP also stimulated the pertussis toxin-insensitive uptake of [3H]thymidine in CHO-V3 cells. The concentration-response curves for this effect were monophasic in cells expressing low and medium levels of V3Rs; on the contrary, a biphasic curve was observed in cells with high V3R density. Coupling of V3R to increased production of cAMP was only observed in CHOV3 high cells, suggesting a negative relationship between increased cAMP production and DNA synthesis. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by V3R was pertussis toxin insensitive, but was dependent on activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C; both the level and duration of activation were a function of the receptor density. Thus, the human V3R has a pharmacological profile clearly distinct from that of the human V1R and V2R and activates several signaling pathways via different G proteins, depending on the level of receptor expression.

In vivo experiments performed in rat revealed that d[Cha4]AVP was able to stimulate both ACTH and corticosterone secretion and exhibits negligible vasopressor activity. It retains about 30% of the antidiuretic activity of VP.

All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods using BOC chemistry for all but one peptide (8), which required the use of Fmoc chemistry. The binding and functional properties of these position 4 substituted analogues of dAVP (d[X(4)]AVP) and the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP (Derick et al. Endocrinology 2002, 143, 4655-4664) were evaluated on human arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1a), V(1b), and V(2) receptors and on the human oxytocin (OT) receptor expressed in living Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Binding studies revealed that broad modifications of the fourth residue of dAVP do not significantly alter affinity for the human V(1b) receptor. Only aromatic (Phe, Tyr, Trp) or negatively charged (Glu) residues reduce V(1b) affinity. By contrast, the human V(1a) and more particularly the human V(2) and the OT receptors are more sensitive to many of these modifications. Thus, the replacement of the Gln(4) residue of dAVP by aliphatic (Leu, Cha) or positively charged (Orn, Lys, Arg, Har) amino acids led to analogues exhibiting drastic reductions of their affinity for the human V(1a), V(2), and OT receptors. Consequently, in addition to the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP, peptides 6 and 17-20 display excellent selectivities for the human V(1b) receptor. The key structural requirement responsible for optimal V(1b) selectivity appears to be the length and branching of the aliphatic side chain of the fourth residue of dAVP. Functional studies performed on CHO cells expressing the different human AVP/OT receptors confirm the V(1b) selectivity of peptides 6, 17, 18, 20, and d[Cha(4)]AVP. However, d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), which triggers an excellent coupling between the human V(2) receptor and adenylyl cyclase, was found to exhibit both V(1b) and V(2) agonism in functional tests. More interestingly, these functional experiments revealed that, depending on the AVP/OT receptor, a given d[X(4)]AVP analogue may behave as a full agonist or as a partial agonist. This strongly suggests that the fourth residue of dAVP plays an important role in the coupling between the hormone-receptor complex, the heterotrimeric G protein, and the effectors. In conclusion, the synthesis of these d[X(4)]AVP analogues led to the discovery of new V(1b) agonists with high affinity and greatly enhanced selectivities. Thus, in addition to d[Cha(4)]AVP, d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), and d[Har(4)]AVP (20) are useful new tools for studying the structure and the function of the human V(1b) receptor.',\n",

BAT3 triggered NKp30-mediated cytotoxicity and was necessary for tumor rejection in a multiple myeloma model. These data identify BAT3 as a cellular ligand for NKp30.

However, the mechanisms underlying the exposure of the intracellular ligand BAT3 to surface NKp30 and its role in NK-DC cross talk remained elusive. Electron microscopy and flow cytometry demonstrate that exosomes released from 293T cells and iDCs express BAT3 on the surface and are recognized by NKp30-Ig. Overexpression and depletion of BAT3 in 293T cells directly correlates with the exosomal expression level and the activation of NK cell-mediated cytokine release. Furthermore, the NKp30-mediated NK/DC cross talk resulting either in iDC killing or maturation was BAT3-dependent. Taken together this puts forward a new model for the activation of NK cells through intracellular signals that are released via exosomes from accessory cells. The manipulation of the exosomal regulation may offer a novel strategy to induce tumor immunity or inhibit autoimmune diseases caused by NK cell-activation.',\n",

Based on these data, we show for the first time that BAG-6(686-936) comprises a subdomain of BAG-6, which is sufficient for receptor docking and inhibition of NKp30-dependent NK cell cytotoxicity as part of a tumor immune escape mechanism.

In sympathetic neurons coexpressing sortilin and p75NTR, we found that proBDNF is an apoptotic ligand that induces death at subnanomolar concentrations.

Moreover, addition of preformed complexes of soluble sortilin and proBDNF failed to induce apoptosis of cells coexpressing both sortilin and p75NTR, suggesting that interaction of proBDNF with both receptors on the cell surface is required to initiate cell death.

Within minutes of BDNF application to cultured hippocampal neurons, spontaneous firing rate was dramatically increased, as were the frequency and amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents. The increased frequency of postsynaptic currents resulted from the change in presynaptic firing. However, the increased amplitude was postsynaptic in origin because it was selectively blocked by intracellular injection of the tyrosine kinase receptor (Ntrk2/TrkB) inhibitor K-252a and potentiated by injection of the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid.

       "   'ALK1 is an endothelial-specific type I receptor of the TGFbeta receptor family whose heterozygous mutations cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2. Although TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta3 have been shown to bind ALK1 under specific experimental conditions, they may not represent the physiological ligands for this receptor. In the present study, we demonstrate that BMP9 induces the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in microvascular endothelial cells, and this phosphorylation lasts over a period of 24 hours. BMP9 also activates the ID1 promoter-derived BMP response element (BRE) in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 45 +/- 27 pg/mL), and this activation is abolished by silencing ALK1 expression or addition of ALK1 extracellular domain. Overexpression of endoglin increases the BMP9 response, whereas silencing of both BMPRII and ActRIIA expressions completely abolishes it. BMP10, which is structurally close to BMP9, is also a potent ALK1 ligand. Finally, we demonstrate that BMP9 and BMP10 potently inhibit endothelial cell migration and growth, and stimulate endothelial expression of a panel of genes that was previously reported to be activated by the constitutively active form of ALK1. Taken together, our results suggest that BMP9 and BMP10 are two specific ALK1 ligands that may physiologically trigger the effects of ALK1 on angiogenesis.',\n",

Introduction of BMP10-specific residues into BMP9 yields BMP10-like ligands with diminished signalling activity in C2C12 cells, validating the tripartite mechanism. The loss of osteogenic signalling in C2C12 does not translate into non-osteogenic activity in vivo and BMP10 also induces bone-formation.

       "   'BMPR2 is a type II Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-Î² family receptor that is fundamentally associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in humans. BMPR2 shares functional similarities with the type II activin receptors ACVR2A and ACVR2B, as it interacts with an overlapping group of TGF-Î² family growth factors (GFs). However, how BMPR2 recognizes GFs remains poorly understood. Here, we solved crystal structures of BMPR2 in complex with the GF activin B and of ACVR2A in complex with the related GF activin A. We show that both BMPR2 and ACVR2A bind GFs with nearly identical geometry using a conserved hydrophobic hot spot, while differences in contacting residues are predominantly found in loop areas. Upon further exploration of the GF-binding spectrum of the two receptors, we found that although many GFs bind both receptors, the high-affinity BMPR2 GFs comprise BMP15, BMP10, and Nodal, whereas those of ACVR2A are activin A, activin B, and GDF11. Lastly, we evaluated GF-binding domain BMPR2 variants found in human PAH patients. We demonstrate that mutations within the GF-binding interface resulted in loss of GF binding, while mutations in loop areas allowed BMPR2 to retain the ability to bind cognate GFs with high affinity. In conclusion, the in\\xa0vitro activities of BMPR2 variants and the crystal structures reported here indicate biochemically relevant complexes that explain how some GF-binding domain variants can lead to PAH.']},\n",

To obtain further insight into its function, we cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized the extracellular domain (ECD) of mouse and human endoglin fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain. We found that mouse and human endoglin ECD-Fc bound directly, specifically, and with high affinity to bone morphogenetic proteins 9 and 10 (BMP9 and BMP10) in surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) and cell-based assays. We performed a function mapping analysis of the different domains of endoglin by examining their contributions to the selectivity and biological activity of the protein. The BMP9/BMP10 binding site was localized to the orphan domain of human endoglin composed of the amino acid sequence 26-359. We established that endoglin and type II receptors bind to overlapping sites on BMP9. In the in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, the mouse and the truncated human endoglin ECD-Fc both significantly reduced VEGF-induced vessel formation. Finally, murine endoglin ECD-Fc acted as an anti-angiogenic factor that decreased blood vessel sprouting in VEGF/FGF-induced angiogenesis in in vivo angioreactors and reduced the tumor burden in the colon-26 mouse tumor model. Together our findings indicate an important role of soluble endoglin ECD in the regulation of angiogenesis and highlight efficacy of endoglin-Fc as a potential anti-angiogenesis therapeutic agent.']},\n",

BMPR2 shares functional similarities with the type II activin receptors ACVR2A and ACVR2B, as it interacts with an overlapping group of TGF-Î² family growth factors (GFs). However, how BMPR2 recognizes GFs remains poorly understood. Here, we solved crystal structures of BMPR2 in complex with the GF activin B and of ACVR2A in complex with the related GF activin A. We show that both BMPR2 and ACVR2A bind GFs with nearly identical geometry using a conserved hydrophobic hot spot, while differences in contacting residues are predominantly found in loop areas. Upon further exploration of the GF-binding spectrum of the two receptors, we found that although many GFs bind both receptors, the high-affinity BMPR2 GFs comprise BMP15, BMP10, and Nodal, whereas those of ACVR2A are activin A, activin B, and GDF11. Lastly, we evaluated GF-binding domain BMPR2 variants found in human PAH patients. We demonstrate that mutations within the GF-binding interface resulted in loss of GF binding, while mutations in loop areas allowed BMPR2 to retain the ability to bind cognate GFs with high affinity. In conclusion, the in\\xa0vitro activities of BMPR2 variants and the crystal structures reported here indicate biochemically relevant complexes that explain how some GF-binding domain variants can lead to PAH.']},\n",

Targeted disruption of BMP3 in mice results in increased trabecular bone formation, whereas transgenic overexpression of BMP3 in skeletal cells leads to spontaneous fracture, consistent with BMP3 having a negative role in bone mass regulation. Here we investigate the importance of BMP3 as a mediator of BMP signaling in the adult skeleton. We find that osteoblasts (OBL) and osteocytes are the source of BMP3 in adult bone. Using in vitro cultures of primary bone marrow stromal cells, we show that overexpression of BMP3 suppresses OBL differentiation, whereas loss of BMP3 increases colony-forming unit fibroblasts and colony-forming unit OBL. The ability of BMP3 to affect OBL differentiation is due to its interaction with activin receptor type 2b (Acvr2b) because knockdown of endogenous Acvr2b in bone marrow stromal cells reduces the suppressive effect of BMP3 on OBL differentiation. These findings best fit a model in which BMP3, produced by mature bone cells, acts to reduce BMP signaling through Acvr2b in skeletal progenitor cells, limiting their differentiation to mature OBL. Our data further support the idea that endogenous BMPs have a physiological role in regulating adult bone mass.']},\n",

BMP induces its signal to regulate growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of various cells upon trimeric complex formation with two distinct type I and type II receptors on the cell surface: both are single-transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. To identify the amino acid residues on BMP type I receptor responsible for its ligand binding, the structure-activity relationship of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the BMP type IA receptor (sBMPR-IA) was investigated by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The mutant receptors, as well as sBMPR-IA, were expressed as fusion proteins with thioredoxin in Escherichia coli, and purified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) after digestion with enterokinase. Structural analysis of the parent protein and representative mutants in solution by CD showed no detectable differences in their folding structures. The binding affinity of the mutants to BMP-4 was determined by surface plasmon resonance biosensor. All the mutant receptors examined, with the exception of Y70A, displayed reduced affinities to BMP-4 with the rank order of decreases: I52A (17-fold) approximately F75A (15-fold) >> T64A (4-fold) = T62A (4-fold) approximately E54A (3-fold). The decreases in binding affinity observed for the latter three mutants are mainly due to decreased association rate constants while alterations in rate constants both, for association and dissociation, result in the drastically reduced affinities for the former two mutants. These results allow us to conclude that sBMPR-IA recognizes the ligand using the concave face of the molecule. The major ligand-binding site of the BMP type IA receptor consists of Phe75 in loop 2 and Ile52, Glu54, Thr62 and Thr64 on the three-stranded beta-sheet.

       "   'Normal human bone marrow stroma cells include stem cells for both haemopoietic and osteochondrogenic lineages and express both bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I and type II receptors. As a member of the TGF-beta super-family, BMP-6 binds to both BMP type I and type II receptors and is involved in the developmental processes of renal and hepatic systems as well as of human foetal intestine. Also, BMP-6 induces osteoblastic differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells and is an autocrine stimulator of chondrocyte differentiation. The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of BMP-6 on human cobblestone-area-forming cells (CAFC), that represent the functional primitive repopulating haemopoietic stem cell in long-term bone marrow culture. Also, the effect of BMP-6 on marrow stroma production of interleukin-6, -11 and their common receptor gp130 that is expressed in haemopoietic stem cells and is indispensable for their proliferation and tri-lineage differentiation was examined. Moreover, the effect of BMP-6 on marrow stroma release of soluble adhesion molecule VCAM-1 mediating the primitive haemopoietic stem cell adhesion to marrow stroma was examined. The number of CAFC was significantly reduced after BMP-6 treatment from 88+/-10 per 10(5)cells in control cultures in a dose dependent manner to only 48+/-3 per 10(5)cells in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated cultures, P< 0.01. Quantitative ELISA measurement revealed 50 ng/ml BMP-6 was able to significantly reduce IL-6 and IL-11 production from marrow stroma, P< 0.01. Also, BMP-6 significantly increased soluble gp130 release by 7.4-fold in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated marrow stroma cultures. The profound rapid increase in this natural antagonist of human IL-6 cytokine family may reduce the gp130 signaling. Also, the soluble VCAM-1 released increased by two-fold in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated marrow stroma cultures. The marked increase in the soluble form may exert an antagonist effect on the function of VCAM-1 (ligand for VLA4). Recently, blocking the VLA4/VCAM-1 adhesion pathway was shown to mobilise haemopoietic CD34 positive cells in normal individuals. Also, we previously observed a significantly lower expression of VLA4 (CD49d) on G-CSF-mobilised blood CD34 positive cells than on bone marrow CD34 positive cells before mobilisation in the same normal donors. Since BMP are currently being used in clinical trials for bone repair and fracture healing, the present results suggest a possible role for BMP-6 in mobilising CD34 positive cells for transplantation. Further in vitro tests are required to evaluate this potential mobilising role of BMP-6 in human long-term bone marrow culture.']},\n",

By contrast, BMP-6 and BMP-7 induce alkaline phosphatase activity through Smad1 and Smad5, but not through Smad8. Consistent with these findings, BMP-4 induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8, but BMP-6 activated only Smad1 and Smad5. BMP-4 and GDF-5 are known to bind to activin receptor-like kinase 3 (ALK-3) and/or ALK-6 (also termed BMP type IA and type IB receptors, respectively), whereas BMP-6 and BMP-7 preferentially bind to ALK-2.

Moreover, addition of BMP-4 and BMP-6 to C2C12 cells resulted in higher alkaline phosphatase activity than that of only one of these BMPs.

       "   'Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare human genetic disorder characterized by altered skeletal development and extraskeletal ossification. All cases of FOP are caused by activating mutations in the type I BMP/TGFÎ² cell surface receptor ACVR1, which over-activates signaling through phospho-Smad1/5 (pSmad1/5). To investigate the mechanism by which FOP-ACVR1 enhances pSmad1/5 activation, we used zebrafish embryonic dorsoventral (DV) patterning as an assay for BMP signaling. We determined that the FOP mutants ACVR1-R206H and -G328R do not require their ligand binding domain to over-activate BMP signaling in DV patterning. However, intact ACVR1-R206H has the ability to respond to both Bmp7 and Activin A ligands. Additionally, BMPR1, a type I BMP receptor normally required for BMP-mediated patterning of the embryo, is dispensable for both ligand-independent signaling pathway activation and ligand-responsive signaling hyperactivation by ACVR1-R206H. These results demonstrate that FOP-ACVR1 is not constrained by the same receptor/ligand partner requirements as WT-ACVR1.',\n",
       "   'Heterodimeric TGF-Î² ligands outperform homodimers in a variety of developmental, cell culture, and therapeutic contexts; however, the mechanisms underlying this increased potency remain uncharacterized. Here, we use dorsal-ventral axial patterning of the zebrafish embryo to interrogate the BMP2/7 heterodimer signaling mechanism. We demonstrate that differential interactions with BMP antagonists do not account for the reduced signaling ability of homodimers. Instead, we find that while overexpressed BMP2 homodimers can signal, they require two nonredundant type I receptors, one from the Acvr1 subfamily and one from the Bmpr1 subfamily. This implies that all BMP signaling within the zebrafish gastrula, even BMP2 homodimer signaling, requires Acvr1. This is particularly surprising as BMP2 homodimers do not bind Acvr1 in vitro. Furthermore, we find that the roles of the two type I receptors are subfunctionalized within the heterodimer signaling complex, with the kinase activity of Acvr1 being essential, while that of Bmpr1 is not. These results suggest that the potency of the Bmp2/7 heterodimer arises from the ability to recruit both Acvr1 and Bmpr1 into the same signaling complex.',\n",

ALK-5 is a TGF-beta type I receptor, whereas ALK-2 and ALK-4 are activin type I receptors. Here we investigated the binding of proteins in the BMP family to ALKs. In transfected COS cells, the binding of osteogenic protein (OP)-1 and BMP-4 to certain ALKs was observed in the absence of type II receptors, and their binding was increased after co-transfection of a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans, DAF-4. OP-1 bound to ALK-2 and ALK-6 efficiently, and to ALK-3 less efficiently, whereas BMP-4 bound to ALK-3 and ALK-6 efficiently. Similarly, OP-1 bound to ALK-2, ALK-3, and/or ALK-6 in various nontransfected cell lines, although the binding profiles were different between different cell types. BMP-4 bound to ALK-3 in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and human foreskin fibroblasts.

However, certain effects of activin, like induction of follicle stimulating hormone secretion in rat pituitary cells were not observed for OP-1.

In contrast, activin induced phosphorylation of Smad2, association with Smad4, and induction of the activin response element from the Xenopus Mix.2 gene. Biochemical analysis revealed that constitutively active ALK2 associated with and phosphorylated Smad1 on the COOH-terminal SSXS motif, and also regulated Smad5 and Smad8 phosphorylation. Activated ALK2 also induced the Tlx2 promoter in the absence of BMP7. Furthermore, we show that ALK1 (TSRI), an orphan receptor that is closely related to ALK2 also mediates Smad1 signaling. Thus, ALK1 and ALK2 induce Smad1-dependent pathways and ALK2 functions to mediate BMP7 but not activin signaling.']},\n",

BMPR2 shares functional similarities with the type II activin receptors ACVR2A and ACVR2B, as it interacts with an overlapping group of TGF-Î² family growth factors (GFs). However, how BMPR2 recognizes GFs remains poorly understood. Here, we solved crystal structures of BMPR2 in complex with the GF activin B and of ACVR2A in complex with the related GF activin A. We show that both BMPR2 and ACVR2A bind GFs with nearly identical geometry using a conserved hydrophobic hot spot, while differences in contacting residues are predominantly found in loop areas. Upon further exploration of the GF-binding spectrum of the two receptors, we found that although many GFs bind both receptors, the high-affinity BMPR2 GFs comprise BMP15, BMP10, and Nodal, whereas those of ACVR2A are activin A, activin B, and GDF11. Lastly, we evaluated GF-binding domain BMPR2 variants found in human PAH patients. We demonstrate that mutations within the GF-binding interface resulted in loss of GF binding, while mutations in loop areas allowed BMPR2 to retain the ability to bind cognate GFs with high affinity. In conclusion, the in\\xa0vitro activities of BMPR2 variants and the crystal structures reported here indicate biochemically relevant complexes that explain how some GF-binding domain variants can lead to PAH.',\n",
       "   'Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) are universal regulators of animal development. We report the identification and cloning of the BMP type II receptor (BMPR-II), a missing component of this receptor system in vertebrates. BMPR-II is a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase that binds BMP-2 and BMP-7 in association with multiple type I receptors, including BMPR-IA/Brk1, BMPR-IB, and ActR-I, which is also an activin type I receptor. Cloning of BMPR-II resulted from a strong interaction of its cytoplasmic domain with diverse transforming growth factor beta family type I receptor cytoplasmic domains in a yeast two-hybrid system. In mammalian cells, however, the interaction of BMPR-II is restricted to BMP type I receptors and is ligand dependent. BMPR-II binds BMP-2 and -7 on its own, but binding is enhanced by coexpression of type I BMP receptors. BMP-2 and BMP-7 can induce a transcriptional response when added to cells coexpressing ActR-I and BMPR-II but not to cells expressing either receptor alone. The kinase activity of both receptors is essential for signaling. Thus, despite their ability to bind to type I and II receptors receptors separately, BMPs appear to require the cooperation of these two receptors for optimal binding and for signal transduction. The combinatorial nature of these receptors and their capacity to crosstalk with the activin receptor system may underlie the multifunctional nature of their ligands.']},\n",

Competitive binding analysis and mutagenesis reveals a unique BTLA binding site centered on a critical lysine residue in cysteine-rich domain 1 of HVEM. The BTLA binding site on HVEM overlaps with the binding site for the herpes simplex virus 1 envelope glycoprotein D, but is distinct from where LIGHT binds, yet glycoprotein D inhibits the binding of both ligands, potentially nullifying the pathway. The binding site on HVEM for BTLA is conserved in the orphan TNFR, UL144, present in human CMV. UL144 binds BTLA, but not LIGHT, and inhibits T cell proliferation, selectively mimicking the inhibitory cosignaling function of HVEM. The demonstration that distinct herpesviruses target the HVEM-BTLA cosignaling pathway suggests the importance of this pathway in regulating T cell activation during host defenses.']},\n",

In structural homology studies and computational docking experiments we delineated the N-terminal region of the globular C1q region of CTRP8 and the leucine-rich repeat units 7 and 8 of RXFP1 to mediate this new ligand-receptor interaction. CTRP8 secreted from HEK293T cells, recombinant human (rh) CTRP8, and short synthetic peptides derived from the C1q globular domain of human CTRP8 caused the activation of RXFP1 as determined by elevated intracellular cAMP levels and the induction of a marked pro-migratory phenotype in established glioblastoma (GB) cell lines and primary cells from GB patients. Employing a small competitor peptide, we were able to disrupt the CTRP8-RXFP1-induced increased GB motility. The CTRP8-RXFP1-mediated migration in GB cells involves the activation of PI3K and specific protein kinase C pathways and the increased production/secretion of the potent lysosomal protease cathepsin B (cathB), a known prognostic marker of GB. Specific inhibition of CTRP8-induced cathB activity effectively blocked the ability of primary GB to invade laminin matrices. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed the direct interaction of human CTRP8 with RXFP1. Our results support a therapeutic approach in GB aimed at targeting multiple steps of the CTRP8-RXFP1 signalling pathway by a combined inhibitor and peptide-based strategy to block GB dissemination within the brain.']},\n",

We have found that the negatively charged side chains of Glu-744 and Glu-747 are important for the interaction between C3(H2O) and factor H, a result in general agreement with an earlier synthetic peptide study (Fishelson, Z.

The first are residues required for sCR1 to be an I cofactor for the first two cleavages of alpha-chain. These are all acidic residues and include the Glu-736/Glu-737 pair, Glu-747, and the Glu-754/Asp-755 pairing. The second class affects only the ability of sCR1 to be a cofactor for the third factor I cleavage and include Glu-744 and the Lys-757/Glu-758 pairing. The dominance of acidic residues in the loss-of-function mutants is striking and suggests that H and CR1 contribute basic residues to the interface. Additionally, although there is partial overlap, the contacts required for CR1 binding appear to extend over a wider portion of the 727-767 segment than is the case for factor H.

Due to the importance of C3d-CR2 interaction in the design of vaccines, many studies have indicated the interactions are pH-dependent. Moreover, C3d-CR2 interactions at pH 5.0 are unknown. To investigate the molecular mechanism of pH-regulating C3d-CR2 interaction, molecular dynamics simulations for C3d-CR2 complex in different pH are performed. Our results revealed that the protonation of His9 in C3d at pH 6.0 slightly weakens C3d-CR2 association as reducing pH from 7.4 to 6.0, initiated from a key hydrogen bond formed between Gly270 and His9 in C3d at pH 6.0. When reducing pH from 6.0 to 5.0, the protonation of His33 in C3d weakens C3d-SCR1 association by changing the hydrogen-bond network of Asp36, Glu37, and Glu39 in C3d with Arg13 in CR2. In addition, the protonation of His90 significantly enhances C3d-SCR2 association. This is because the enhanced hydrogen-bond interactions of His90 with Glu63 and Ser69 of the linker change the conformations of the linker, Cys112-Asn116 and Pro87-Gly91 regions. This study uncovers the molecular mechanism of the mediation of pH on C3d-CR2 interaction, which is valuable for vaccine design.']},\n",

Ligand blot experiments with human (125)I-C3 on endosomal proteins show binding to a 600-kDa protein, indistinguishable from LRP/alpha(2)MR by the following criteria: it is competed by receptor-associated protein (the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein that impairs binding of all ligands to LRP/alpha(2)MR) and by lactoferrin and Pseudomonas exotoxin, other well known ligands of the multifunctional receptor. Binding of C3 is sensitive to reduction of the receptor and is Ca(2+)-dependent. All these features are typical for cysteine-rich binding repeats of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. In LRP/alpha(2)MR, they are found in four cassettes (2, 8, 10, and 11 repeats). Ligand blotting to chicken LR8 demonstrates that a single 8-fold repeat is sufficient for binding.

We investigated the interaction between C4BP and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), an endocytic receptor involved in the catabolism of various heparin-binding proteins. Both plasma-derived C4BP and recombinant C4BP consisting of only its alpha-chains (rC4BPalpha) bound efficiently to immobilized LRP, as determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Complementary, two distinct fragments of LRP, i.e. clusters II and IV, both associated to immobilized rC4BPalpha, and binding could be inhibited by the LRP antagonist receptor-associated protein. Further analysis showed that association of rC4BPalpha to LRP was inhibited by heparin or by anti-C4BP antibody RU-3B9, which recognizes the heparin-binding region of the C4BP alpha-chains. In cellular degradation experiments, LRP-expressing fibroblasts effectively degraded (125)I-labeled rC4BPalpha, whereas their LRP-deficient counterparts displayed a 4-fold diminished capacity of degrading (125)I-rC4BPalpha. Finally, initial clearance of C4BP in mice was significantly delayed upon co-injection with receptor-associated protein. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the alpha-chains of C4BP comprise a binding site for LRP. We propose that LRP mediates at least in part the catabolism of C4BP and, as such, may regulate C4BP participation in complement and hemostatic processes.']},\n",

In this study we compared a new cyclic antagonist, F-[OPdChaWR], with an acyclic derivative, MeFKPdChaWr, for their capacities to bind to C5aR on human PMN and human umbilical artery membranes. We also compared their inhibition of myeloperoxidase (MPO) secretion from human PMNs and their inhibition of human umbilical artery contraction induced by human recombinant C5a. 2. In both PMNs and umbilical artery, the cyclic and acyclic C5a antagonists displayed insurmountable antagonism against C5a. There were differences in selectivities for the C5aR with F-[OPdChaWR] (pKb 8.64+/-0.21) being 30 times more potent than MeFKPdChaWr (pKb 7.16+/-0.11, P<0.05) in PMNs, but of similar potency (pKb 8.19+/-0.38 vs pKb 8.28+/-0.29, respectively) in umbilical artery. This trend was also reflected in their relative binding affinities, both antagonists having similar affinities (-logIC50 values) for C5aR in umbilical artery membranes (F-[OPdChaWR], 7.00+/-0.46; MeFKPdChaWr, 7.23+/-0.17), whereas in PMN membranes the C5aR affinity of the cycle F-[OPdChaWR] (7.05+/-0. 06) was four times higher than that of acyclic MeFKPdChaWr (6.43+/-0. 24, P<0.05). 3. In summary, the results reveal that these antagonists are insurmountable in nature against C5a for C5aR on at least two human cell types, and the differences in relative receptor binding affinities and antagonistic potencies against C5a are consistent with differences in receptors within these cell types. The nature of these differences is yet to be elucidated.',\n",
       "   'The substantial variations in the responses of cells to the anaphylatoxin C5a and its desarginated form, C5adR(74), suggest that more than one type of cell surface receptor for these ligands might exist. However, only a single receptor for C5a and C5adR(74), CD88, has been characterized to date. Here we report that the orphan receptor C5L2/gpr77, which shares 35% amino acid identity with CD88, binds C5a with high affinity but has a 10-fold higher affinity for C5adR(74) than CD88. C5L2 also has a moderate affinity for anaphylatoxin C3a, but cross-competition studies suggest that C3a binds to a distinct site from C5a.

Unlike CD88 and C3a receptor, C5L2 transfected into RBL-2H3 cells does not support degranulation or increases in intracellular [Ca(2+)] and is not rapidly internalized in response to ligand binding. However, ligation of C5L2 by anaphylatoxin did potentiate the degranulation response to cross-linkage of the high affinity IgE receptor by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism.

       "   'The C terminus is responsible for all of the agonist activity of C5a at human C5a receptors (C5aRs). In this report we have mapped the ligand binding site on the C5aR using a series of agonist and antagonist peptide mimics of the C terminus of C5a as well as receptors mutated at putative interaction sites (Ile(116), Arg(175,) Arg(206), Glu(199), Asp(282), and Val(286)). Agonist peptide 1 (Phe-Lys-Pro-d-cyclohexylalanine-cyclohexylalanine-d-Arg) can be converted to an antagonist by substituting the bulkier Trp for cyclohexylalanine at position 5 (peptide 2). Conversely, mutation of C5aR transmembrane residue Ile(116) to the smaller Ala (I116A) makes the receptor respond to peptide 2 as an agonist (Gerber, B. O., Meng, E. C., Dotsch, V., Baranski, T. J., and Bourne, H. R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3394-3400). However, a potent cyclic hexapeptide antagonist, Phe-cyclo-[Orn-Pro-d-cyclohexylalanine-Trp-Arg] (peptide 3), derived from peptide 2 and which binds to the same receptor site, remains a full antagonist at I116AC5aR. This suggests that although the residue at position 5 might bind near to Ile(116), the latter is not essential for either activation or antagonism. Arg(206) and Arg(175) both appear to interact with the C-terminal carboxylate of C5a agonist peptides, suggesting a dynamic binding mechanism that may be a part of a receptor activation switch. Asp(282) has been previously shown to interact with the side chain of the C-terminal Arg residue, and Glu(199) may also interact with this side chain in both C5a and peptide mimics. Using these interactions to orient NMR-derived ligand structures in the binding site of C5aR, a new model of the interaction between peptide antagonists and the C5aR is presented.']},\n",

       "   'CADM1 (Cell adhesion molecule 1), a cell adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, is involved in cell-cell interaction and the formation and maintenance of epithelial structure. Expression of CADM1 is frequently downregulated in various tumors derived from epithelial cells. However, the intracellular signaling pathways activated by CADM1-mediated cell adhesion remain unknown. Here, we established a cell-based spreading assay to analyze the signaling pathway specifically activated by the trans-homophilic interaction of CADM1. In the assay, MDCK cells expressing exogenous CADM1 were incubated on the glass coated with a recombinant extracellular fragment of CADM1, and the degree of cell spreading was quantified by measuring their surface area. Assay screening of 104 chemical inhibitors with known functions revealed that LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), efficiently suppressed cell spreading in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibitors of Akt and Rac1, downstream effectors of PI3K, also partially suppressed cell spreading, while the addition of both inhibitors blocked cell spreading to the same extent as did LY294002. Furthermore, MPP3 and Dlg, membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs (MAGuK) proteins, connect CADM1 with p85 of PI3K by forming a multi-protein complex at the periphery of cells. These results suggest that trans-homophilic interaction mediated by CADM1 activates the PI3K pathway to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton and form epithelial cell structure.',\n",

       "   'The CADM family of proteins consists of four neuronal specific adhesion molecules (CADM1, CADM2, CADM3 and CADM4) that mediate the direct contact and interaction between axons and glia. In the peripheral nerve, axon-Schwann cell interaction is essential for the structural organization of myelinated fibres and is primarily mediated by the binding of CADM3, expressed in axons, to CADM4, expressed by myelinating Schwann cells. We have identified-by whole exome sequencing-three unrelated families, including one de novo patient, with axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2) sharing the same private variant in CADM3, Tyr172Cys. This variant is absent in 230\\u2009000 control chromosomes from gnomAD and predicted to be pathogenic. Most CADM3 patients share a similar phenotype consisting of autosomal dominant CMT2 with marked upper limb involvement. High resolution mass spectrometry analysis detected a newly created disulphide bond in the mutant CADM3 potentially modifying the native protein conformation. Our data support a retention of the mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and reduced cell surface expression in vitro. Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy imaging revealed decreased co-localization of the mutant with CADM4 at intercellular contact sites. Mice carrying the corresponding human mutation (Cadm3Y170C) showed reduced expression of the mutant protein in axons. Cadm3Y170C mice showed normal nerve conduction and myelin morphology, but exhibited abnormal axonal organization, including abnormal distribution of Kv1.2 channels and Caspr along myelinated axons.

       "   'Receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) are a family of single transmembrane domain proteins shown to be important for the transport and ligand specificity of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor. In this report, we describe the analysis of pharmacological properties of the human calcitonin receptor (hCTR) coexpressed with different RAMPs with the use of the Xenopus laevis melanophore expression system. We show that coexpression of RAMP3 with human calcitonin receptor changed the relative potency of hCTR to human calcitonin (hCAL) and rat amylin. RAMP1 and RAMP2, in contrast, had little effect on the change of hCTR potency to hCAL or rat amylin. When coexpressed with RAMP3, hCTR reversed the relative potency by a 3.5-fold loss in sensitivity to hCAL and a 19-fold increase in sensitivity to rat amylin. AC66, an inverse agonist, produced apparent simple competitive antagonism of hCAL and rat amylin, as indicated by linear Schild regressions. The potency of AC66 was changed in the blockade of rat amylin but not hCAL responses with RAMP3 coexpression. The mean pK(B) for AC66 to hCAL was 9.4 +/- 0.3 without RAMP3 and 9.45 +/- 0.07 with RAMP3. For the antagonism of AC66 to rat amylin, the pK(B) was 9.25 +/- 0.15 without RAMP3 and 8.2 +/- 0.35 with RAMP3. The finding suggests that RAMP3 might modify the active states of calcitonin receptor in such a way as to create a new receptor phenotype that is \"amylin-like.\" Irrespective of the physiological association of the new receptor species, the finding that a coexpressed membrane protein can completely change agonist and antagonist affinities for a receptor raises implications for screening in recombinant receptor systems.',\n",

Whether transfected alone or together with RAMP, human (h)CTR(I1-) appeared mainly at the surface of HEK-293 cells. Expression of CTR(I1-) alone led to significant increases in cAMP in response to hCGRP or hAM, though both peptides remained about 100-fold less potent than hCT. However, the apparent potency of AM, like that of CGRP, approached that of CT when CTR(I1-) was co-expressed with RAMP. CGRP- or AM-evoked cAMP production was strongly inhibited by salmon CT-(8-32), a selective amylin receptor antagonist, but not by hCGRP-(8-37) or hAM-(22-52), antagonists of CGRP and AM receptors, respectively. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of CT-(8-32) were much stronger in cells co-expressing CTR(I1-) and RAMP than in cells expressing CTR(I1-) alone. Co-expression of CTR(I1-) with RAMP thus appears to produce functional CT-(8-32)-sensitive AM receptors.',\n",
       "   'Calcitonin receptors (CTRs) dimerize with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) to generate high-affinity amylin (AMY) receptors; however, the relative contribution of individual RAMP domains to the formation of AMY receptors is poorly understood. We have used chimeras between RAMP1 and RAMP2 that specifically exchanged the N-terminal, transmembrane, or C-terminal domain and examined these in assays of [(125)I]amylin binding or peptide-induced cAMP signaling in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with wild-type or chimeric RAMPs and human CTRa. The specificity of peptides in competition for [(125)I]amylin binding was principally dictated by the N-terminal domain present in the chimeras; however, the maximal level of binding induced was dictated by the transmembrane domain present. This extended previous data (Zumpe et al., 2000) to provide a distinction between the transmembrane domain and the C terminus in this function. In contrast to the effects on binding, each of the RAMP domains played a role in the signaling phenotype of the receptors. In particular, the potency of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was most influenced by the C-terminal domain present, in which the presence of the RAMP1 C-terminal domain led to increased potency over CTRa alone, whereas chimeras with the RAMP2 C-terminal domain did not induce increased CGRP potency. The data provide additional support for the importance of the N terminus in determining binding affinity but reveal a prominent role of the transmembrane domain in the strength of amylin binding and a unique role for the C terminus in signaling by peptides to stimulate cAMP production.',\n",

Both form heterodimeric RAMP/receptor complexes at the cell surface. This association represents a novel principle of G protein-coupled receptor function. RAMP1 is transported to the cell surface together with the CRLR or the CT receptor. Here, we have investigated the functional relevance of the short C-terminal intracellular tail QSKRTEGIV and of the single transmembrane domain of human (h) RAMP1 for their interactions with the hCRLR to constitute a CGRP receptor. To this end, hRAMP1 has been sequentially truncated from the C-terminus, and [(125)I]h alpha CGRP/hRAMP1/hCRLR association at the cell surface and cAMP accumulation in response to h alpha CGRP have been examined. With the C-terminal truncation of hRAMP1 by four amino acids wild-type hRAMP1 function was maintained, and the hCRLR was required for the transport of hRAMP1 to the cell surface. Further truncation of hRAMP1 through removal of the remaining five intracellular amino acids revealed CRLR-independent cell surface delivery but otherwise normal hRAMP1 activity. Sequential shortening of the hRAMP1 transmembrane domain resulted in progressively impaired association with the hCRLR and, as a consequence, abolished CGRP receptor function. In conclusion, the intracellular QSKRT sequence adjacent to the transmembrane domain of hRAMP1 provides a signal for intracellular retention. The sequence is unrelated to consensus endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval motives and overridden by the presence of the hCRLR. The entire single transmembrane domain of hRAMP1 together with one hydrophilic amino acid residue at its C-terminus is required for the formation of a fully functional CGRP/hRAMP1/hCRLR receptor complex.',\n",
       "   'Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator neuropeptide known to be involved in the regulation of vascular tone. Results of previous studies from our laboratory and others suggest that vascular sensitivity to CGRP is enhanced during pregnancy and that the female sex steroid hormones estradiol-17beta (E2) and progesterone (P4) may be involved in this process. We hypothesized that CGRP receptors in the mesenteric artery are increased during pregnancy and with sex steroid hormone treatments. In the present study, we investigated whether pregnancy and female sex steroid hormones modulate the CGRP-receptors CGRP-A and CGRP-B in the mesenteric artery in the rat. The CGRP-A receptor consists of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1); however, the CGRP-B receptor needs to be further characterized. Messenger RNA levels for CRLR and RAMP1 were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and CGRP-B receptor proteins levels were determined by Western blot analysis. In addition, [125I]CGRP binding was measured by Scatchard analysis. Both mRNA for CGRP-A (CRLR and RAMP1) and the protein for CGRP-B receptors in mesenteric arteries were increased with pregnancy compared to nonpregnant, diestrous animals. A P4 antagonist, RU-486, downregulated and P4 upregulated these receptors in mesenteric arteries (P < 0.05) in pregnant rats. In adult ovariectomized rats, P4 upregulated CRLR and RAMP1 mRNA levels as well as [125I]CGRP-binding sites. The CGRP-B-receptor protein levels were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated by P4 and by combined E2 and P4 treatment. Together with earlier findings, these data suggest that increases in the expression of CGRP-A (CRLR and RAMP1) and CGRP-B receptors in mesenteric arteries may be important in reducing vascular resistance and in vascular adaptations that occur during pregnancy; in addition, P4 may be involved in this process.',\n",

The receptor for CGRP is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that requires three proteins for function. CGRP binds to a heterodimer composed of the GPCR calcitonin-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP1), a single transmembrane protein required for pharmacological specificity and trafficking of the CLR/RAMP1 complex to the cell surface. In addition, the CLR/RAMP1 complex requires a third protein named CGRP-receptor component protein (RCP) for signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that depletion of RCP from cells inhibits CLR signaling, and in vivo studies have demonstrated that expression of RCP correlates with CLR signaling and CGRP efficacy. It is not known whether RCP interacts directly with CLR to exert its effect. The current studies identified a direct interaction between RCP and an intracellular domain of CLR using yeast two-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation. When this interacting domain of CLR was expressed as a soluble fusion protein, it coimmunoprecipitated with RCP and inhibited signaling from endogenous CLR. Expression of this dominant-negative domain of CLR did not significantly inhibit trafficking of CLR to the cell surface, and thus RCP may not have a chaperone function for CLR. Instead, RCP may regulate CLR signaling in the cell membrane, and direct interaction between RCP and CLR is required for CLR activation. To date, RCP has been found to interact only with CLR and represents a novel neuroendocrine regulatory step in GPCR signaling.']},\n",

We used agonists and antagonists to define their pharmacology, expressing the CT(a) receptor alone or with RAMPs in COS-7 cells and measuring cAMP accumulation. Intermedin short, otherwise known as adrenomedullin 2, mirrored the action of alpha CGRP, being a weak agonist at CT(a), AMY(2a), and AMY(3a) receptors but considerably more potent at AMY(1a) receptors. Likewise, the linear calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) analogs (Cys(ACM)(2,7))h alpha CGRP and (Cys(Et)(2,7))h alpha CGRP were only effective at AMY(1a) receptors, but they were partial agonists. As previously observed in COS-7 cells, there was little induction of the AMY(2a) receptor phenotype; thus, AMY(2a) was not examined further in this study. The antagonist peptide salmon calcitonin(8-32) (sCT(8-32)) did not discriminate strongly between CT and AMY receptors; however, AC187 was a more effective antagonist of AMY responses at AMY receptors, and AC413 additionally showed modest selectivity for AMY(1a) over AMY(3a) receptors. CGRP(8-37) also demonstrated receptor-dependent effects. CGRP(8-37) more effectively antagonized AMY at AMY(1a) than AMY(3a) receptors, although it was only a weak antagonist of both, but it did not inhibit responses at the CT(a) receptor. Low CGRP(8-37) affinity and agonism by linear CGRP analogs at AMY(1a) are the classic signature of a CGRP2 receptor. Our data indicate that careful use of combinations of agonists and antagonists may allow pharmacological discrimination of CT(a), AMY(1a), and AMY(3a) receptors, providing a means to delineate the physiological significance of these receptors.']},\n",

A three-dimensional model of the [CCK-AR-CCK] complex was built. In this model, Arg197 was the best candidate residue for a ionic interaction with the sulfate of CCK. Arg197 was exchanged for a methionine by site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type and mutated CCK-AR were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells for pharmacological and functional analysis. The mutated receptor on Arg197 did not bind the agonist radioligand 125I-BH-[Thr, Nle]-CCK-9; however, it bound the nonpeptide antagonist [3H]-SR27,897 as the wild-type receptor. The mutant was approximately 1,470- and 3,200-fold less potent than the wild-type CCK-AR to activate G proteins and to induce inositol phosphate production, respectively. This is consistent with the 500-fold lower potency and 800-fold lower affinity of nonsulfated CCK relative to sulfated CCK on the wild-type receptor. These data, together with those showing that the mutated receptor failed to discriminate nonsulfated and sulfated CCK while it retained other pharmacological features of the CCK-AR, strongly support an interaction between Arg197 of the CCK-AR binding site and the sulfate of CCK.

We analyzed the role played by the two partners of this interaction. The exchange of Met-195 for a leucine caused a minor decrease (2. 8-fold) on the affinity of the high affinity sites for sulfated CCK-9, a strong drop (73%) of their number, and a 30-fold decrease on the affinity of the low and very low affinity sites for sulfated CCK-9, with no change in their number. The mutation also caused a 54-fold decrease of the potency of the receptor to induce inositol phosphates production. The high affinity sites of the wild-type CCK-A receptor were highly selective (800-fold) toward sulfated versus nonsulfated CCK, whereas low and very low affinity sites were poorly selective (10- and 18-fold). In addition, the M195L mutant bound, and responded to, sulfated CCK analogues with decreased affinities and potencies, whereas it bound and responded to nonsulfated CCK identically to the wild-type receptor. Thus, Met-195 interacts with the aromatic ring of the sulfated tyrosine to correctly position the sulfated group of CCK in the binding site of the receptor. This interaction is essential for CCK-dependent transition of the CCK-A receptor to a high affinity state.

This represents the first direct evidence that, despite having identical affinities for binding and potencies for activating type A and B receptors, CCK is docked via distinct mechanisms, with the amino terminus more exposed to the aqueous milieu when bound to the type B CCK receptor than to the type A CCK receptor. Of interest, despite this difference in binding, activation of both receptors results in analogous direction of movement of the fluorescent indicator probes.\",\n",
       "   'The predominant brain cholecystokinin receptor (CCK-B/gastrin) has been implicated in mediating many of the central effects of cholecystokinin, including anxiety, panic attacks, satiety, and analgesia, suggesting it is an important pharmacologic target. We now report the cloning and characterization of the cDNA encoding the human brain CCK-B/gastrin receptor. The cDNA was isolated from a human brain library by low stringency screening using the canine \"gastrin\" receptor cDNA as a hybridization probe. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame encoding a 447-amino-acid protein with seven putative hydrophobic transmembrane domains and significant homology with other known members of the gastrin/cholecystokinin receptor family. Agonist and antagonist affinities of the recombinant human brain receptor expressed in COS-7 cells are consistent with a classical \"CCK-B\" receptor as defined by the literature. In COS-7 cells expressing the cloned receptor, CCK-8-stimulated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization suggesting second messenger signaling through phospholipase C. CCK-B/gastrin receptor transcripts were identified in human brain, stomach, and pancreas using high stringency Northern blot analysis. Southern blot hybridization analysis of human genomic DNA indicates that a single gene encodes both the brain and the stomach CCK-B/gastrin receptors. Our data suggest that the CCK-B and gastrin receptors are identical and that the long standing distinction between them may no longer apply.',\n",

The deduced amino acid sequence was highly conserved as compared with those of the gastrin receptors in Mastomys enterochromaffin-like cells (90%) and canine parietal cells (89%). Human brain CCK-B receptors possessed slightly but significantly higher affinities for CCK-8 than for gastrin I, while both ligands bound equally to Mastomys enterochromaffin-like cell-derived gastrin receptors. Both CCK-8 and gastrin I markedly augmented phosphoinositide hydrolysis and cytosolic free calcium levels in the CHO transfectants, indicating that the cloned CCK-B receptor could functionally couple with intracellular signaling molecules. Moreover, CCK-8 and gastrin I dose-dependently increased [3H]thymidine incorporation of the CHO transfectants in serum-free medium and promoted cell growth. The CCK-B receptor mRNA was abundantly expressed in particular areas of the human brain and stomach, such as the cerebral cortex and mucosa of the gastric fundus. This is the first demonstration of trophic effects of CCK and gastrin through the normal human brain CCK-B receptor. The availability of this receptor cDNA will help to clarify the precise role of CCK in the central nervous system as well as digestive organs.']},\n",

The major form of PEN in the brain is 22 residues in length. Previous studies have identified shorter forms of PEN in mouse brain and neuroendocrine cells; these shorter forms were named PEN18, PEN19 and PEN20, with the number reflecting the length of the peptide. The C-terminal five residues of PEN20 are identical to the C-terminus of a procholecystokinin (proCCK)-derived peptide, named proCCK56-62, that is present in mouse brain. ProCCK56-62 is highly conserved across species although it has no homology to the bioactive cholecystokinin domain. ProCCK56-62 and a longer form, proCCK56-63 were tested for their ability to engage GPR83. Both peptides bind GPR83 with high affinity, activate second messenger pathways, and induce ligand-mediated receptor endocytosis. Interestingly, the shorter PEN peptides, ProCC56-62, and ProCCK56-63 differentially activate signal transduction pathways. Whereas PEN22 and PEN20 facilitate receptor coupling to Gai, PEN18, PEN19 and ProCCK peptides facilitate coupling to Gas. Furthermore, the ProCCK peptides exhibit dose dependent Ga subtype selectivity in that they faciliate coupling to Gas at low concentrations and Gai at high concentrations. These data demonstrate that peptides derived from two distinct peptide precursors can differentially activate GPR83, and that GPR83 exhibits Ga subtype preference depending on the nature and concentration of the peptide. These results are consistent with the emerging idea that endogenous neuropeptides function as biased ligands. ']},\n",

One such molecule is vMIP-I, a C-C type chemokine of undefined function and binding specificity, encoded by the Kaposi\\'s sarcoma herpesvirus HHV-8. We report here that vMIP-I binds to and induces cytosolic [Ca(2+)] signals in human T cells selectively through CCR8, a CC chemokine receptor associated with Th2 lymphocytes. Furthermore, using a panel of 65 different human, viral, and rodent chemokines, we have established a comprehensive ligand binding \"fingerprint\" for CCR8. The receptor exhibits marked \"high\" affinity (K(d) < 15 nM) only for four chemokines, three of them of viral origin: vMIP-I, vMIP-II, vMCC-I, and human I-309. A previously unreported second class of lower affinity ligands includes MCP-3 and possibly two other viral chemokines. vMIP-I and I-309 appear to act as CCR8 agonists: binding to and inducing cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation through the receptor. By contrast, vMIP-II and vMCC-I act as potent antagonists: binding without inducing signaling, and blocking the effects of I-309 and vMIP-I. These results suggest a ligand hierarchy for CCR8, identifying vMIP-I as a selective viral chemokine agonist. CCR8 may thus engage a specific subset of chemokines with the potential to regulate each other during viral infection and immune regulation.',\n",

Here, we analyzed the signal transduction pathways involved in this activity on BW5147 lymphoma. Inhibition of the CCL1 activity by pertussis toxin suggested the involvement of a G protein-coupled chemokine receptor. The role of CCR8 was supported by the observation that vMIP-I, another CCR8-ligand identified from the genome of a T cell transforming herpes virus, shared CCL1 anti-apoptotic activity. In addition to CCR8, BW5147 cells also expressed the CXCR4 receptor but its ligand, SDF-1 (CXCL12) showed only a modest anti-apoptotic activity. Other chemokines acting on CCR2, CCR4 and CCR5 failed to protect against apoptosis and to induce BW5147 chemotaxis, suggesting that these receptors were not functionally expressed. By contrast, both CCL1 and vMIP-I up-regulated ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation in BW5147 cells. Further analysis demonstrated that CCL1 activates the MAPK pathway in CCR8-transfected CHO cells. The implication of this pathway was confirmed by the fact that PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK kinases, as well as a dominant negative isoform of the M-RAS protein specifically blocked the anti-apoptotic activity of CCL1.',\n",
       "   'Mast cells are the central mediating cells of allergic reactions. Binding of allergen specific IgE to high affinity IgE receptor (Fcepsilon RI) and subsequent binding of allergen by the IgE causes receptor cross-linking and activation. In a study examining the differential gene expression in human cord blood-derived mast cells (CBMCs) mediated by activation of Fcepsilon RI both with IgE and IgE followed by cross-linking with alpha-IgE, the chemokine I-309 was found to be upregulated. I-309 is the ligand for the CCR8 receptor and is responsible for chemoattraction of TH2 type T-cells. Interestingly, I-309 RNA and protein levels were elevated not only in response to IgE/alpha-IgE activation but also by IgE alone. In addition, the I-309 levels were augmented by growth of the CBMCs in the presence of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-4. GM-CSF and MIP-1alpha secretion was also induced by IgE. These results suggest that IgE, through the production and release of cytokines such as I-309, GM-CSF and MIP-1alpha could promote an inflammatory reaction in the absence of antigen stimulation of mast cells.',\n",

ZK 756326 inhibited the binding of the CCR8 ligand I-309 (CCL1), with an IC(50) value of 1.8 muM. Furthermore, ZK 756326 was a full agonist of CCR8, dose-responsively eliciting an increase in intracellular calcium and cross-desensitizing the response of the receptor to CCL1. In addition, ZK 756326 stimulated extracellular acidification in cells expressing human CCR8. The ability of ZK 756326 to induce a response was receptor-specific and mediated through Galpha(i), because it could be blocked by treatment with pertussis toxin. The CCR8 agonist activated cells expressing murine CCR8, eliciting their chemotaxis and inducing phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1/2. Like CCL1, ZK 756326 inhibited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) fusion of cells expressing CD4 and CCR8. Finally, unlike mCCL1, ZK 756326 bound to and activated a form of mCCR8 that was mutated to eliminate O-linked sulfation at tyrosines 14 and 15. Therefore, ZK 756326 is most probably not binding in the same manner as CCL1 but can activate the switch mechanism involved in transducing signaling events. In summary, we have identified a nonpeptide agonist of CCR8. This compound may be useful in evaluating the physiological role of CCR8 in HIV infection, as well as in the general study of CCR8 biology without the constraints inherent to the use of protein agonists such as its natural ligand.',\n",
       "   'The nucleotide sequence for a putative chemokine receptor, termed TER1, ChemR1, or CKR-L1, was recently obtained by a polymerase chain reaction-based cloning technique. It encodes a protein of 355 amino acids that shows 32-45% sequence identity with human chemokine receptors. The gene was localized on human chromosome 3p21-24, the site for the genes for the five known CC chemokine receptors, suggesting that the natural ligand may be a CC chemokine. We have stably expressed this receptor in murine pre-B cells 300-19 and have tested their responsiveness to 20 human chemokines and some other potential agonists. The CC chemokine I-309 was the only agonist that selectively induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and chemotaxis in receptor-transfected 300-19 cells. Stromal cell-derived factor 1, which binds to murine CXCR4 expressed in parental as well as transfected 300-19 cells, served as positive control in the functional screening. The interaction of I-309 with TER1 was of high affinity as shown by 125I-I-309 binding (Kd of 1.2 nM) and transient [Ca2+]i changes at subnanomolar concentrations of agonist. Migration responses in receptor-transfected 300-19 cells was typically bimodal with maximal activity at 10 nM of I-309. These data demonstrate that TER1 (ChemR1 or CKR-L1) is the receptor for I-309, and we propose to call this receptor CCR8 in agreement with the current nomenclature for chemokine receptors. The expression of CCR8 in blood leukocytes and lymphocytes was analyzed by Northern blot. No transcripts were found in RNA from freshly isolated blood neutrophils, monocytes, cultured macrophages, and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T lymphocytes, and a faint hybridization signal corresponding to the RNA species of 4 kb was obtained only with RNA from interleukin-2-treated T lymphocytes. CCR8 is unusual for its selectivity for a single chemokine, previously shown only for CXCR1 and CXCR4, which bind interleukin-8 and stromal cell-derived factor 1, respectively. Identification of the receptor for I-309 represents a significant progress in determining the function of I-309 in inflammation and disease.']},\n",

Fetal trophoblasts can also express receptors for inflammatory chemokines, and they are one of the few cell types that express atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2), previously known as D6. ACKR2 binds many inflammatory CC chemokines but cannot stimulate cell migration or activate signaling pathways used by conventional chemokine receptors. Existing evidence suggests that ACKR2 is a specialized chemokine scavenger, but its function in primary human trophoblasts has not been explored. In mice, ACKR2 is thought to be dispensable for the reproductive success of unchallenged females that have conceived naturally, but it can suppress inflammation-induced abortion and aid the survival of implanted allogeneic embryos. In this article, we demonstrate that cultured primary human trophoblasts express ACKR2 far more strongly than genes encoding conventional receptors for inflammatory CC chemokines. Moreover, these cells are capable of the rapid internalization and efficient scavenging of extracellular chemokine, and this is mediated by ACKR2. We also report that in unchallenged DBA/1j mice, Ackr2 deficiency increases the incidence of stillbirth and neonatal death, leads to structural defects in the placenta, and can decrease fetal weight. Loss of Ackr2 specifically from fetal cells makes a key contribution to the placental defects. Thus, primary human trophoblasts use ACKR2 to scavenge chemokines, and ACKR2 deficiency can cause abnormal placental structure and reduced neonatal survival.',\n",

We have recently cloned a novel murine beta-chemokine receptor and report here the identification and characterization of a highly homologous human gene termed human D6 (hD6). This is a promiscuous beta-chemokine receptor and appears to be able to bind the majority of members of the beta-chemokine family. It is, however, specific for this family and shows no detectable affinity for members of the alpha-chemokine or the C or CXXXC chemokines. Unlike the majority of other chemokine receptors, human D6 does not appear to be able to flux calcium following ligand binding, thus it is currently not clear if this novel receptor is indeed a signaling receptor. Human D6 is expressed in a range of tissues including hemopoietic cells although it appears not to be ubiquitously expressed in hemopoietic cells. Human D6, unlike some other beta-chemokine receptors, appears not to be able to function as an entry co-factor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-)1 on CD4-expressing cells.']},\n",

In human monocytes pretreatment with eotaxin decreased responsiveness to MCP-1, a selective ligand for CCR2, as well as to RANTES and MIP-1 beta, which bind to CCR5.

Human eotaxin protein was a strong and specific eosinophil chemoattractant in vitro and was an effective eosinophil chemoattractant when injected into the skin of a rhesus monkey. Radiolabeled eotaxin was used to identify a high affinity receptor on eosinophils (0.52 nM Kd), expressed at 4.8 x 10(4) sites per cell. This receptor also bound RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 with lower affinity, but not macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha. Eotaxin could desensitize calcium responses of eosinophils to RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein-3, although RANTES was able to only partially desensitize eosinophil calcium responses to eotaxin.

A monoclonal antibody recognizing CKR-3 was used to show that eosinophils, but not other leukocyte types, expressed this receptor. This pattern of expression was confirmed by Northern blot with RNA from highly purified leukocyte subsets. The restricted expression of CKR-3 on eosinophils and the fidelity of eotaxin binding to CKR-3, provides a potential mechanism for the selective recruitment and migration of eosinophils within tissues.',\n",

Eotaxin and MCP-4 elicited basophil migration in vitro with similar efficacy as regulated upon activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) and MCP-3. They also induced the release of histamine and leukotrienes in IL-3-primed basophils, but their efficacy was lower than that of MCP-1 and MCP-3, which were the most potent stimuli of exocytosis. Pretreatment of the basophils with a CCR3-blocking antibody abrogated the migration induced by eotaxin, RANTES, and by low to optimal concentrations of MCP-4, but decreased only minimally the response to MCP-3. The CCR3-blocking antibody also affected exocytosis: it abrogated histamine and leukotriene release induced by eotaxin, and partially inhibited the response to RANTES and MCP-4. In contrast, the antibody did not affect the responses induced by MCP-1, MCP-3, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, which may depend on CCR1 and CCR2, two additional receptors detected by Northern blotting with basophil RNA. This study demonstrates that CCR3 is the major receptor for eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-4 in human basophils, and suggests that basophils and eosinophils, which are the characteristic effector cells of allergic inflammation, depend largely on CCR3 for migration towards different chemokines into inflamed tissues.',\n",

The quaternary structure of eotaxin was investigated by ultracentrifugation and NMR, and it was found to be in equilibrium between monomer and dimer under a wide range of conditions. At pH </= 5 and low ionic strength, eotaxin was found to be predominantly a monomer. The three-dimensional structure of the eotaxin monomer solved at pH 5.0 revealed that it has a typical chemokine fold, which includes a 3-stranded beta-sheet and an overlying alpha-helix. Except for the N-terminal residues (residues 1-8), the core of the protein is well defined. The eotaxin structure is compared with the chemokines regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1); eotaxin binds only CC chemokine receptor CCR3, whereas RANTES binds many receptors including CCR3, and MCP-1 binds a distinct receptor, CCR2. The RMSD of the eotaxin ensemble of structures with the RANTES average minimized monomeric subunit is 5.52 +/- 0.87 A over all backbone atoms and 1.14 +/- 0.09 A over backbone atoms of residues 11-28 and 34-65. The most important difference between the structures is in the N-terminal residues that are unstructured in eotaxin but structured in RANTES and MCP-1. Several residues in the loop region of RANTES show similar packing in eotaxin (residues 11-17). As the N-terminal and loop regions have been shown to be critical for receptor binding and signaling, this structure will be useful for determining the basis for CCR3 selectivity of the eotaxin.']},\n",

This study shows that eotaxin also interacts with CCR2 and CCR5 and can, thus, affect the responses of monocytes, which express both receptors. In human monocytes pretreatment with eotaxin decreased responsiveness to MCP-1, a selective ligand for CCR2, as well as to RANTES and MIP-1 beta, which bind to CCR5. Similar effects were obtained with transfected cells expressing CCR2 or CCR5, but here a difference became apparent: Eotaxin triggered CCR5 at a concentration of 100 nM but not CCR2 even at 1 microM, suggesting an antagonistic effect on this receptor. In agreement with this observation, eotaxin induced internalization of CCR5 but not of CCR2 in human monocytes and transfected cells. Binding studies showed that eotaxin displaces (125) I-MCP-1 from monocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, and functional experiments showed that eotaxin inhibits MCP-1-induced chemotaxis and enzyme release. The results demonstrate that eotaxin is a CCR5 agonist and a CCR2 antagonist. The present findings suggest a role of eotaxin in the fine-tuning of cellular responses occurring at sites of allergic inflammation, in which both MCP-1 and eotaxin are produced.

Here, we report that although CCL11, CCL24 and CCL26 are neither agonists nor antagonists of CXCR3, CCL11 binds with high affinity to CXCR3. This suggests that, in vivo, CXCR3 may act as a decoy receptor, sequestering locally produced CCL11. We also demonstrate that the CXCR3 ligands inhibit CCR3-mediated functional responses of both human eosinophils and CCR3 transfectants induced by all three eotaxins, with CXCL11 being the most efficacious antagonist. The examination of CCR3-CCR1 chimeric constructs revealed that CCL11 and CXCL11 share overlapping binding sites contained within the CCR3 extracellular loops, a region that was previously shown to be essential for effective receptor-activation. Hence, eosinophil responses mediated by chemokines acting at CCR3 may be regulated by two distinct mechanisms: the antagonistic effects of CXCR3 ligands and the sequestration of CCL11 by CXCR3-expressing cells.

It is, however, specific for this family and shows no detectable affinity for members of the alpha-chemokine or the C or CXXXC chemokines. Unlike the majority of other chemokine receptors, human D6 does not appear to be able to flux calcium following ligand binding, thus it is currently not clear if this novel receptor is indeed a signaling receptor. Human D6 is expressed in a range of tissues including hemopoietic cells although it appears not to be ubiquitously expressed in hemopoietic cells.

Mutual cross-desensitization between CCL2 and vCCL4 was demonstrated in the CCR2-transfected cells.

It is concluded that human herpesvirus 6 encodes a highly selective and efficacious CCR2 agonist, which will attract CCR2 expressing cells, for example macrophages and monocytes, conceivably for the virus to infect and to establish latency in.

To date, eight receptors for the beta-chemokine subfamily have been described. We have recently cloned a novel murine beta-chemokine receptor and report here the identification and characterization of a highly homologous human gene termed human D6 (hD6). This is a promiscuous beta-chemokine receptor and appears to be able to bind the majority of members of the beta-chemokine family. It is, however, specific for this family and shows no detectable affinity for members of the alpha-chemokine or the C or CXXXC chemokines. Unlike the majority of other chemokine receptors, human D6 does not appear to be able to flux calcium following ligand binding, thus it is currently not clear if this novel receptor is indeed a signaling receptor. Human D6 is expressed in a range of tissues including hemopoietic cells although it appears not to be ubiquitously expressed in hemopoietic cells. Human D6, unlike some other beta-chemokine receptors, appears not to be able to function as an entry co-factor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-)1 on CD4-expressing cells.']},\n",

HCC-1 competed with MIP-1alpha for binding to CCR1-transfected cells, but with a markedly reduced affinity (IC50 = 93 nM versus 1.3 nM for MIP-1alpha). Similarly, HCC-1 was less potent than MIP-1alpha in inducing inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in CCR1-transfected cells.

ACKR2 binds many inflammatory CC chemokines but cannot stimulate cell migration or activate signaling pathways used by conventional chemokine receptors. Existing evidence suggests that ACKR2 is a specialized chemokine scavenger, but its function in primary human trophoblasts has not been explored. In mice, ACKR2 is thought to be dispensable for the reproductive success of unchallenged females that have conceived naturally, but it can suppress inflammation-induced abortion and aid the survival of implanted allogeneic embryos. In this article, we demonstrate that cultured primary human trophoblasts express ACKR2 far more strongly than genes encoding conventional receptors for inflammatory CC chemokines. Moreover, these cells are capable of the rapid internalization and efficient scavenging of extracellular chemokine, and this is mediated by ACKR2. We also report that in unchallenged DBA/1j mice, Ackr2 deficiency increases the incidence of stillbirth and neonatal death, leads to structural defects in the placenta, and can decrease fetal weight. Loss of Ackr2 specifically from fetal cells makes a key contribution to the placental defects.

CCX-CKR is an atypical chemokine receptor with high affinity for CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 chemokines, but is not known to activate intracellular signaling pathways. However, CCX-CKR acts as decoy receptor and efficiently internalizes these chemokines, thereby preventing their interaction with other chemokine receptors, like CCR7 and CCR9. Internalization of fluorescently labeled CCL19 correlated with Î²-arrestin2-GFP translocation. Moreover, recruitment of Î²-arrestins to CCX-CKR in response to CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 was demonstrated using enzyme-fragment complementation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer methods. To unravel why CCX-CKR is unable to activate Gi signaling, CCX-CKR chimeras were constructed by substituting its intracellular loops with the corresponding CCR7 or CCR9 domains. The signaling properties of chimeric CCX-CKR receptors were characterized using a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-driven reporter gene assay. Unexpectedly, wild type CCX-CKR and a subset of the chimeras induced an increase in CRE activity in response to CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 in the presence of the Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin. CCX-CKR signaling to CRE required an intact DRY motif. These data suggest that inactive Gi proteins impair CCX-CKR signaling most likely by hindering the interaction of this receptor with pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins that transduce signaling to CRE. On the other hand, recruitment of the putative signaling scaffold Î²-arrestin to CCX-CKR in response to chemokines might allow activation of yet to be identified signal transduction pathways.',\n",

After initial selectin-mediated tethering and rolling, firm adhesion of lymphocytes requires rapid upregulation of lymphocyte integrin adhesiveness.

However, the CC chemokine ELC (Epstein-Barr virus-induced molecule 1 ligand chemokine, or CCL19) shares the same receptor, and ELC transcripts have been observed in the T cell areas of lymphoid organs. Here, we show that perivascular ELC is transcytosed to the luminal surfaces of HEVs and enables efficient T cell homing to lymph nodes. In situ hybridization on sections of human tonsil showed no ELC mRNA in HEVs, but immunostaining revealed ELC protein in cytoplasmic vesicles of HEV cells. Furthermore, ELC injected into the footpads of mice entered the draining lymph nodes and was presented by HEVs. Finally, intracutaneous injections of ELC in mice lacking functionally relevant ELC and SLC (plt/plt mice) restored T cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes as efficiently as SLC.

We termed this novel chemokine from EBI1-Ligand Chemokine as ELC (see below). The ELC mRNA was most strongly expressed in the thymus and lymph nodes. Recombinant ELC protein was expressed as a fusion protein with the Flag tag (ELC-Flag). For receptor-binding assays, recombinant ELC protein fused with the secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was used. By stably expressing five CC chemokine receptors (CCR1 to 5) and five orphan receptors, ELC-SEAP was found to bind specifically to an orphan receptor EBI1. Only ELC-Flag, but not MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, eotaxin, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), or liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC), competed with ELC-SEAP for EBI1. ELC-Flag-induced transient calcium mobilization and chemotactic responses in EBI1-transfected cells. ELC-Flag also induced chemotaxis in HUT78 cells expressing endogenous EBI1 at high levels. By somatic hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, the gene for ELC (SCYA19) was mapped to chromosome 9p13 instead of chromosome 17q11.2 where the genes for CC chemokines are clustered. Taken together, ELC is a highly specific ligand for EBI1, which is known to be expressed in activated B and T lymphocytes and strongly up-regulated in B cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus and T cells infected with herpesvirus 6 or 7. ELC and EBI1 may thus play roles in migration and homing of normal lymphocytes, as well as in pathophysiology of lymphocytes infected with these herpesviruses.

SLC tagged with the secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SLC-SEAP) showed specific binding to CCR7 that was fully competed by SLC with an IC50 of 0.5 nM. SLC also induced a vigorous chemotactic response in CCR7-expressing L1.2 cells with a typical bell-shaped dose-response curve and a maximal migration at 10 nM. When assessed using CCR7-transfected L1.2 cells, SLC and ELC were essentially equivalent in terms of cross desensitization in calcium mobilization via CCR7, cross-competition in binding to CCR7, and induction of chemotaxis via CCR7. SLC and ELC were also shown to fully share receptors expressed on cultured normal T cells known to express CCR7. Notably, however, SLC was somehow less efficient in cross-desensitization against ELC in calcium mobilization and in cross-competition with ELC for binding when assessed using cultured normal T cells. Thus, SLC and ELC, even though sharing only 32% amino acid identity, constitute a genetically and functionally highly related subgroup of CC chemokines.']},\n",

In contrast to the known CCL19/CCR7 ligand/receptor pair, CRAM stimulation by CCL19 did not result in typical chemokine-receptor-dependent cellular activation like calcium mobilization or migration. Instead, we demonstrate that CRAM is constitutively recycling via clathrin-coated pits and able to internalize CCL19 as well as anti-CRAM antibodies. As this absence of classical chemokine receptor responses and the recycling and internalization features are characteristic for non-classical chemokine receptors, we suggest that CRAM is the newest member of this group.

However, the mechanisms underlying the functional regulation of chemokines on the endothelial cell surface remain ill-defined. A promiscuous chemokine receptor, the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), has been implicated in the regulation of chemokine functions. Here we show that DARC is selectively expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in the high endothelial venules (HEV) of unstimulated lymph nodes (LN). To examine the biological significance of DARC expression in HEV, we performed competitive binding experiments with 20 different chemokines. The results showed that DARC selectively bound distinct members of the pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL2, CCL5 and CCL7, but not lymphoid chemokines such as CCL21, CCL19, CXCL12 and CXCL13 that are normally expressed in HEV. CCL2 bound to DARC failed to induce a significant cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation in CCR2B-expressing cells, whereas the free form of CCL2 induced a distinct [Ca(2+)] elevation, suggesting that DARC down-regulates activities of pro-inflammatory chemokines upon binding. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding DARC did not induce any obvious changes in the cell number or leukocyte subsets in the peripheral and mesenteric LN. Neither did DARC deficiency significantly affect lymphocyte migration into LN. These results suggest that DARC may be a scavenger for pro-inflammatory chemokines, but not a presenting molecule for lymphoid chemokines at HEV and that it is probably functionally dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking to HEV-bearing lymphoid tissues under physiological conditions.',\n",

However, the identification of BMD QTL genes remains a big challenge. In the current study, we focused our efforts to identify the BMD candidate gene in chromosome 1 (Chr 1) QTL that was detected from a cross involving high BMD CAST/EiJ (CAST) and low BMD C57BL/6J (B6) mice. To this end, we have combined several approaches including: (1) fine mapping the BMD QTL in Chr 1 of the B6.CAST F2 female mice using a large number of polymorphic markers; (2) the generation of congenic sublines of mice by repeated backcrossing of CAST with B6 mice and phenotype characterization; (3) expression profiling genes in the QTL region; and (4) SNP analyses to identify the mouse Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (Darc) as a candidate gene for Chr 1 BMD QTL2. We verified the involvement of the Darc protein in BMD variation by evaluating the skeletal phenotype of Darc-knockout mice and congenic sublines of mice carrying small chromosomal segments from CAST BMD QTL. Based on the findings that Darc-antibody blocked formation of multinucleated osteoclasts in vitro and that Darc from CAST binds chemokines, known to regulate osteoclast formation, with reduced affinity compared with Darc from B6 mice, we conclude that Darc regulates BMD negatively by increasing osteoclast formation, and that the genetic association between Darc gene polymorphism and BMD variations in humans merits investigation.']},\n",

To identify the regions of MCP-1 that contact its receptor, CCR2, we substituted all surface-exposed residues with alanine. Some residues were also mutated to other amino acids to identify the importance of charge, hydrophobicity, or aromaticity at specific positions. The binding affinity of each mutant for CCR2 was assayed with THP-1 and CCR2-transfected CHL cells. The majority of point mutations had no effect. Residues at the N-terminus of the protein, known to be crucial for signaling, contribute less than a factor of 10 to the binding affinity. However, two clusters of primarily basic residues (R24, K35, K38, K49, and Y13), separated by a 35 A hydrophobic groove, reduced the level of binding by 15-100-fold. A peptide fragment encompassing residues 13-35 recapitulated some of the mutational data derived from the intact protein. It exhibited modest binding as a linear peptide and dramatically improved affinity when the region which adopts a single turn of a 3(10)-helix in the protein, which includes R24, was constrained by a disulfide bond. Additional constraints at the ends of the peptide, corresponding to the disulfide between the first and third cysteines in MCP-1, yielded further improvements in affinity. Together, these data suggest a model in which a large surface area of MCP-1 contacts the receptor, and the accumulation of a number of weak interactions results in the 35 pM affinity observed for the wild-type (WT) protein. The receptor binding site of MCP-1 also is significantly different from the binding sites of RANTES and IL-8, providing insight into the issue of receptor specificity. It was previously shown that the N-terminus of CCR2 is critical for binding MCP-1 [Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19084-92; Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F.

This identified D25 and D27 of the DYDY motif as being important. On the basis of our data, we propose a model in which the receptor N-terminus lies along the hydrophobic groove in an extended fashion, placing the DYDY motif near the basic cluster involving R24 and K49 of MCP-1. This in turn orients the signaling residues (Y13 and the N-terminus) for productive interaction with the receptor.',\n",

These studies identified a family of antagonists, spiropiperidines. One of the more potent compounds blocks MCP-1 binding to CCR2 with a K(d) of 60 nm, but it is unable to block binding to CXCR1, CCR1, or CCR3. These compounds were effective inhibitors of chemotaxis toward MCP-1 but were very poor inhibitors of CCR1-mediated chemotaxis. The compounds are effective blockers of MCP-1-driven inhibition of adenylate cyclase and MCP-1- and MCP-3-driven cytosolic calcium influx; the compounds are not agonists for these pathways. We showed that glutamate 291 (Glu(291)) of CCR2 is a critical residue for high affinity binding and that this residue contributes little to MCP-1 binding to CCR2. The basic nitrogen present in the spiropiperidine compounds may be the interaction partner for Glu(291), because the basicity of this nitrogen was essential for affinity; furthermore, a different class of antagonists, a class that does not have a basic nitrogen (2-carboxypyrroles), were not affected by mutations of Glu(291). In addition to the CCR2 receptor, spiropiperidine compounds have affinity for several biogenic amine receptors. Receptor models indicate that the acidic residue, Glu(291), from transmembrane-7 of CCR2 is in a position similar to the acidic residue contributed from transmembrane-3 of biogenic amine receptors, which may account for the shared affinity of spiropiperidines for these two receptor classes. The models suggest that the acid-base pair, Glu(291) to piperidine nitrogen, anchors the spiropiperidine compound within the transmembrane ovoid bundle. This binding site may overlap with the space required by MCP-1 during binding and signaling; thus the small molecule ligands act as antagonists. An acidic residue in transmembrane region 7 is found in most chemokine receptors and is rare in other serpentine receptors. The model of the binding site may suggest ways to make new small molecule chemokine receptor antagonists, and it may rationalize the design of more potent and selective antagonists.',\n",

Mutation of highly conserved cysteines in the amino-terminal domain and third extracellular loop of CCR2, but not in the fusion protein, resulted in a dramatic loss of MCP-1 binding, suggesting the existence of a critical intramolecular disulfide bond that positions the amino-terminal protein for ligand interaction. These data indicate that the amino-terminal region of CCR2 is both necessary and sufficient for the high affinity binding of MCP-1 and provide the first direct evidence for activation of a chemokine receptor by a pseudo-tethered ligand.

We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.']},\n",

       "   'CCR6 is the receptor for the chemokine MIP-3 alpha/CCL20. Almost all chemokine receptors contain cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain and in the first, second, and third extracellular loops. In this report, we have studied the importance of all cysteine residues in the CCR6 sequence using site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical techniques. Like all G protein-coupled receptors, mutating disulfide bond-forming cysteines in the first (Cys118) and second (Cys197) extracellular loops in CCR6 led to complete elimination of receptor activity, which for CCR6 was also associated with the accumulation of the receptor intracellularly. Although two additional cysteines in the N-terminal region and the third extracellular loop, which are present in almost all chemokine receptors, are presumed to form a disulfide bond, this has not been demonstrated experimentally for any of these receptors. We found that mutating the cysteines in the N-terminal domain (Cys36) and the third extracellular loop (Cys288) neither significantly affected receptor surface expression nor completely abolished receptor function. Importantly, contrary to several previous reports, we demonstrated directly that instead of forming a disulfide bond, the N-terminal cysteine (Cys36) and the third extracellular loop cysteine (Cys288) contain free SH groups. The cysteine residues (Cys36 and Cys288), rather than forming a disulfide bond, may be important per se. We propose that CCR6 forms only a disulfide bond between the first (Cys118) and second (Cys197) extracellular loops, which confines a helical bundle together with the N-terminus adjacent to the third extracellular loop, creating the structural organization critical for ligand binding and therefore for receptor signaling.',\n",

Among various leukocyte subsets, GPR-CY4 mRNA was detected in lymphocytes (CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and B cells) but not in natural killer cells, monocytes, or granulocytes. Expression of GPR-CY4 mRNA in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was strongly up-regulated by IL-2.

MIP-3alpha was unable to displace the binding of specific CC or CXC chemokines to stable cell lines expressing their respective high affinity receptors, namely CCR1-5 and CXCR1 and CXCR2, suggesting that MIP-3alpha acts through a novel CC chemokine receptor. Therefore, we used degenerate oligonucleotide-based reverse transcriptase PCR to identify candidate MIP-3alpha receptors in lung dendritic cells.

However, CCX-CKR acts as decoy receptor and efficiently internalizes these chemokines, thereby preventing their interaction with other chemokine receptors, like CCR7 and CCR9. Internalization of fluorescently labeled CCL19 correlated with Î²-arrestin2-GFP translocation. Moreover, recruitment of Î²-arrestins to CCX-CKR in response to CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 was demonstrated using enzyme-fragment complementation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer methods. To unravel why CCX-CKR is unable to activate Gi signaling, CCX-CKR chimeras were constructed by substituting its intracellular loops with the corresponding CCR7 or CCR9 domains. The signaling properties of chimeric CCX-CKR receptors were characterized using a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-driven reporter gene assay. Unexpectedly, wild type CCX-CKR and a subset of the chimeras induced an increase in CRE activity in response to CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 in the presence of the Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin. CCX-CKR signaling to CRE required an intact DRY motif. These data suggest that inactive Gi proteins impair CCX-CKR signaling most likely by hindering the interaction of this receptor with pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins that transduce signaling to CRE.

MPIF-1 was the more efficacious (MPIF-1>RANTES=MIP-1alpha>>MIP-1beta). 125I-MIP-1beta binding in Ba/F3-hCCR1 and HL-60(Rx) membranes was competitively displaced by MIP-1alpha, MPIF-1 and MIP-1beta. The binding K(i) for these chemokines with 125I-MIP-1beta were essentially identical in the two membrane systems. Lastly, MIP-1beta antagonized [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange, Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis in HL-60(Rx) cells in response to robust agonists such as MIP-1alpha, RANTES and MPIF-1. Based on our results, we propose that MIP-1beta could function as an endogenous inhibitor of CCR1 function.',\n",

One of these clones was identical to the previously isolated human beta-chemokine, CKbeta8, whereas the other is a splicing variant of CKbeta8, therefore named CKbeta8-1. CKbeta8 was short in 51 nucleotides (17 amino acids) compared with CKbeta8-1. The mature proteins of CKbeta8-1 and CKbeta8 consisted of 116 and 99 amino acids with calculated molecular weights of 12,500 and 10,950, respectively. Both CKbeta8-1 and CKbeta8 were potent agonists at CCR1. These chemokines chemoattracted neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. They also significantly suppressed colony formation by human bone marrow, granulocyte-macrophage, erythroid, and multipotential progenitor cells stimulated by combinations of growth factors.

       "   \"The receptor specificity and signal transduction pathway has been identified and characterized for a truncated form of myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor-1 (MPIF-1(24-99)). MPIF-1 binds specifically to sites, in particular CCR1, shared with macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) on the surface of human monocytes and dendritic cells, as inferred by its ability to compete for [125I]MIP-1alpha, but not for [125I]MIP-1beta or [125I]monocyte chemotactic protein-1(MCP-1) binding to intact cells. Based on calcium flux, MPIF-1 is an agonist on CCR1-transfected HEK-293 cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells, but not on CCR5-, CCR8-, or CX3CR1-transfected cells. The inhibitory effect of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio-triphosphate) (GTP-gammaS) or pertussis toxin pretreatment on MPIF-1 binding and calcium mobilization, respectively, indicates the involvement of G proteins in the interaction of MPIF-1 and its receptor(s). The increase in intracellular free calcium concentration following MPIF-1 treatment is mainly due to the influx of calcium from an extracellular pool. However, a portion of the intracellular free calcium concentration is derived from a phospholipase C inhibitor-sensitive intracellular pool. MPIF-1 induces a rapid dose-dependent release of [3H]arachidonic acid from monocytes that is dependent on extracellular calcium and is blocked by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors. Furthermore, PLA2 activation is shown to be necessary for filamentous actin formation in monocytes. Thus, the MPIF-1 signal transduction pathway appears to include binding to CCR1; transduction by G proteins; effector function by phospholipase C, protein kinase C, calcium flux, and PLA2; and cytoskeletal remodeling.\"]},\n",

The surface expression of CCR3 is not modulated following uptake of particulate substances such as zymosan or latex beads. CCR3 mediates in vitro chemotactic responses to the known ligands, eotaxin and eotaxin-2, because the DC response to these chemokines is inhibited by CCR3-specific mAbs.

CCX-CKR is an atypical chemokine receptor with high affinity for CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 chemokines, but is not known to activate intracellular signaling pathways. However, CCX-CKR acts as decoy receptor and efficiently internalizes these chemokines, thereby preventing their interaction with other chemokine receptors, like CCR7 and CCR9. Internalization of fluorescently labeled CCL19 correlated with Î²-arrestin2-GFP translocation. Moreover, recruitment of Î²-arrestins to CCX-CKR in response to CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 was demonstrated using enzyme-fragment complementation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer methods. To unravel why CCX-CKR is unable to activate Gi signaling, CCX-CKR chimeras were constructed by substituting its intracellular loops with the corresponding CCR7 or CCR9 domains. The signaling properties of chimeric CCX-CKR receptors were characterized using a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-driven reporter gene assay. Unexpectedly, wild type CCX-CKR and a subset of the chimeras induced an increase in CRE activity in response to CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 in the presence of the Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin. CCX-CKR signaling to CRE required an intact DRY motif. These data suggest that inactive Gi proteins impair CCX-CKR signaling most likely by hindering the interaction of this receptor with pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins that transduce signaling to CRE. On the other hand, recruitment of the putative signaling scaffold Î²-arrestin to CCX-CKR in response to chemokines might allow activation of yet to be identified signal transduction pathways.',\n",

Using a specific anti-CCR9 polyclonal antibody, K629, and a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction procedure, a detailed study of CCR9 expression in the thymus and secondary lymphoid organs was performed. The results show that CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes have the highest CCR9 expression in thymus. Single-positive CD8(+) thymocytes continue to express this receptor after abandoning the thymus as mature naive T cells, as suggested by the existence of a CD8(+)CD69(low)CD62L(high) CCR9(+) cell subset. Consistent with this, CD8(+) lymphocytes from lymph nodes, spleen, and Peyer patches express a functional CCR9, as its expression correlates with migration in response to CCL25. Conversely, CD4(+) thymocytes lose CCR9 before abandoning the thymus, and CD4(+) T cells from secondary lymphoid organs also lack CCR9 expression. Analysis of CCR9 expression in thymocytes from mice of different ages showed that CCR9 levels are affected by age, as this receptor is more abundant, and its response to CCL25 is more potent in newborn animals. Collectively, these results suggest that CCR9 has a role in thymocyte development throughout murine life, with clear differences between the CD4(+) and CD8(+) lineages.']},\n",

However, human neutrophils do not migrate when the cells are stimulated with other human CC chemokines, such as human macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (hMIP-1 alpha) and eotaxin, which also use the CCR1 and CCR3 as their receptors. In this report, we demonstrate that while hMIP-1 alpha induced a negligible level of calcium flux and chemotaxis, Lkn-1 produced a high level of calcium flux and chemotaxis in human neutrophils. Lkn-1 cross-desensitized hMIP-1 alpha-induced calcium flux, but hMIP-1 alpha had little effect on the Lkn-1-induced response in human neutrophils. The same pattern was observed in peritoneal neutrophils from wild-type mice, whereas neutrophils from CCR1-/- mice failed to respond to either MIP-1 alpha or Lkn-1. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of receptor for both hMIP-1 alpha and Lkn-1 on human neutrophils with dissociation constants (Kd) of 3.2 nM and 1.1 nM, respectively.

Although originally referred to as the MIP-1alpha/RANTES receptor, CCR1 is quite promiscuous and can be activated by numerous chemokines. We used radioligand binding and [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays in membranes from a cell line transfected to express CCR1 (Ba/F3-hCCR1) to characterize a panel of chemokines (HCC-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MIP-1delta, MPIF-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and RANTES) as CCR1 ligands. In this recombinant model, these chemokines displaced 125I-MIP-1alpha with a wide range of potencies and, with the exception of MCP-2, acted as full agonists in stimulating [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange. We then assessed the utility of HL-60 cells cultured with known differentiating agents (PMA, DMSO, dibutyryl-cAMP or retinoic acid) for investigating CCR1 pharmacology. In [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, membranes from cells cultured with retinoic acid (4-6 days) were the most responsive to activation by MIP-1alpha and MPIF-1. FACS analysis and comparative pharmacology confirmed that these activities were mediated by CCR1. Using [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, intracellular calcium flux and/or whole cell chemotaxis assays in HL-60(Rx) cells, we validated that MIP-1alpha was the most potent CCR1 ligand (MIP-1alpha>MPIF-1>RANTES>or=MIP-1beta) although the ligands differed in their efficacy as agonists. MPIF-1 was the more efficacious (MPIF-1>RANTES=MIP-1alpha>>MIP-1beta). 125I-MIP-1beta binding in Ba/F3-hCCR1 and HL-60(Rx) membranes was competitively displaced by MIP-1alpha, MPIF-1 and MIP-1beta. The binding K(i) for these chemokines with 125I-MIP-1beta were essentially identical in the two membrane systems. Lastly, MIP-1beta antagonized [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange, Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis in HL-60(Rx) cells in response to robust agonists such as MIP-1alpha, RANTES and MPIF-1.

Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta.

It was shown that residues in the N-ter are necessary for binding of the physiologic ligands, RANTES (CCL5) and MIP-1 alpha (CCL3). vMIP-II, encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, is a high affinity CCR5 antagonist, but lacks efficacy as a coreceptor inhibitor. Therefore, we compared the mechanism for engagement by vMIP-II of CCR5 to its interaction with physiologic ligands. RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and vMIP-II bound CCR5 at high affinity, but demonstrated partial cross-competition. Characterization of 15 CCR5 alanine scanning mutants of charged extracellular amino acids revealed that alteration of acidic residues in the distal N-ter abrogated binding of RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and vMIP-II. Whereas mutation of residues in ECL2 of CCR5 dramatically reduced the binding of RANTES and MIP-1 alpha and their ability to induce signaling, interaction with vMIP-II was not altered by any mutation in the exoloops of the receptor. Paradoxically, monoclonal antibodies to N-ter epitopes did not block chemokine binding, but those mapped to ECL2 were effective inhibitors. A CCR5 chimera with the distal N-ter residues of CXCR2 bound MIP-1 alpha and vMIP-II with an affinity similar to that of the wild-type receptor. Engagement of CCR5 by vMIP-II, but not RANTES or MIP-1 alpha blocked the binding of monoclonal antibodies to the receptor, providing additional evidence for a distinct mechanism for viral chemokine binding. Analysis of the coreceptor activity of randomly generated mouse-human CCR5 chimeras implicated residues in ECL2 between H173 and V197 in this function. RANTES, but not vMIP-II blocked CCR5 M-tropic coreceptor activity in the fusion assay. The insensitivity of vMIP-II binding to mutations in ECL2 provides a potential rationale to its inefficiency as an antagonist of CCR5 coreceptor activity.

ACKR2 binds many inflammatory CC chemokines but cannot stimulate cell migration or activate signaling pathways used by conventional chemokine receptors. Existing evidence suggests that ACKR2 is a specialized chemokine scavenger, but its function in primary human trophoblasts has not been explored. In mice, ACKR2 is thought to be dispensable for the reproductive success of unchallenged females that have conceived naturally, but it can suppress inflammation-induced abortion and aid the survival of implanted allogeneic embryos. In this article, we demonstrate that cultured primary human trophoblasts express ACKR2 far more strongly than genes encoding conventional receptors for inflammatory CC chemokines. Moreover, these cells are capable of the rapid internalization and efficient scavenging of extracellular chemokine, and this is mediated by ACKR2. We also report that in unchallenged DBA/1j mice, Ackr2 deficiency increases the incidence of stillbirth and neonatal death, leads to structural defects in the placenta, and can decrease fetal weight. Loss of Ackr2 specifically from fetal cells makes a key contribution to the placental defects.

We have recently cloned a novel murine beta-chemokine receptor and report here the identification and characterization of a highly homologous human gene termed human D6 (hD6). This is a promiscuous beta-chemokine receptor and appears to be able to bind the majority of members of the beta-chemokine family. It is, however, specific for this family and shows no detectable affinity for members of the alpha-chemokine or the C or CXXXC chemokines. Unlike the majority of other chemokine receptors, human D6 does not appear to be able to flux calcium following ligand binding, thus it is currently not clear if this novel receptor is indeed a signaling receptor. Human D6 is expressed in a range of tissues including hemopoietic cells although it appears not to be ubiquitously expressed in hemopoietic cells. Human D6, unlike some other beta-chemokine receptors, appears not to be able to function as an entry co-factor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-)1 on CD4-expressing cells.']},\n",

Although originally referred to as the MIP-1alpha/RANTES receptor, CCR1 is quite promiscuous and can be activated by numerous chemokines. We used radioligand binding and [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays in membranes from a cell line transfected to express CCR1 (Ba/F3-hCCR1) to characterize a panel of chemokines (HCC-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MIP-1delta, MPIF-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and RANTES) as CCR1 ligands. In this recombinant model, these chemokines displaced 125I-MIP-1alpha with a wide range of potencies and, with the exception of MCP-2, acted as full agonists in stimulating [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange. We then assessed the utility of HL-60 cells cultured with known differentiating agents (PMA, DMSO, dibutyryl-cAMP or retinoic acid) for investigating CCR1 pharmacology. In [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, membranes from cells cultured with retinoic acid (4-6 days) were the most responsive to activation by MIP-1alpha and MPIF-1. FACS analysis and comparative pharmacology confirmed that these activities were mediated by CCR1. Using [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, intracellular calcium flux and/or whole cell chemotaxis assays in HL-60(Rx) cells, we validated that MIP-1alpha was the most potent CCR1 ligand (MIP-1alpha>MPIF-1>RANTES>or=MIP-1beta) although the ligands differed in their efficacy as agonists. MPIF-1 was the more efficacious (MPIF-1>RANTES=MIP-1alpha>>MIP-1beta). 125I-MIP-1beta binding in Ba/F3-hCCR1 and HL-60(Rx) membranes was competitively displaced by MIP-1alpha, MPIF-1 and MIP-1beta. The binding K(i) for these chemokines with 125I-MIP-1beta were essentially identical in the two membrane systems. Lastly, MIP-1beta antagonized [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange, Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis in HL-60(Rx) cells in response to robust agonists such as MIP-1alpha, RANTES and MPIF-1. Based on our results, we propose that MIP-1beta could function as an endogenous inhibitor of CCR1 function.']},\n",

       "  'Abstracts': [\"MIP-1beta is a CC-chemokine that plays a role in inflammation and host defense mechanisms by interacting with its specific receptor CCR5. CCR5 is a major coreceptor for macrophage-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and as a consequence, MIP-1beta can inhibit HIV entry. It is therefore of interest to understand how MIP-1beta and other CCR5 ligands bind to their receptor, as such understanding could lead to the rational design of more efficient HIV entry blockers. We have previously demonstrated the importance of Phe13, and of basic residues of the 40's loop, in mediating high-affinity binding of MIP-1beta to CCR5. We have now investigated further the relative contribution of other MIP-1beta residues in the interaction of the chemokine with CCR5, by studying the functional consequences of point mutations within the N-loop and the 3(10) turn of MIP-1beta, affecting the charge, size, and H-bonding properties of the side chains. Our data suggest that, in addition to Phe13, three amino acids of the N-loop and 3(10) turn (Arg18, Lys19, and Arg22) interact with CCR5 through their positive charge. We also found that Pro21 contributes to the CCR5 binding properties of MIP-1beta. Moreover, NMR spectroscopy has revealed that the presence of Tyr at position 15 is necessary for the proper folding of the chemokine. Our results therefore demonstrate that the binding determinants of MIP-1beta consist of residues arranged on one surface of the protein, including most of the basic residues in MIP-1beta, as well as two key hydrophobic groups. The good correlation observed between the potency of the mutants in a functional assay and their binding affinity strongly argues that basic residues Arg18, Lys19, and Arg22 of MIP-1beta are essential for its CCR5 binding properties, without a primary effect on CCR5 activation.\",\n",

The expression of DARC protein and mRNA was examined by immunohistochemistry and northern blotting. The involvement of DARC in chemokine binding was studied by incubating sections with blocking antibodies to DARC (Fy3 and 6), to find out if these reduced 125I-IL-8 binding. Binding of radiolabelled chemokines IL-8, RANTES, MCP-1, but not MIP-1alpha, was found on venular endothelial cells in inflamed synovia from both rheumatoid and non-rheumatoid patients. Excess homologous unlabelled chemokine displaced binding and excess unlabelled RANTES could displace radiolabelled IL-8 binding. DARC protein expression was demonstrated on venular endothelial cells in all samples and DARC mRNA could be detected in extracts from synovia. There was downregulation of DARC protein and mRNA in rheumatoid samples. Binding of IL-8 to both rheumatoid and non-rheumatoid synovia was significantly reduced in the presence of anti-DARC Fy3 and Fy6 monoclonal antibodies.

However, the mechanisms underlying the functional regulation of chemokines on the endothelial cell surface remain ill-defined. A promiscuous chemokine receptor, the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), has been implicated in the regulation of chemokine functions. Here we show that DARC is selectively expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in the high endothelial venules (HEV) of unstimulated lymph nodes (LN). To examine the biological significance of DARC expression in HEV, we performed competitive binding experiments with 20 different chemokines. The results showed that DARC selectively bound distinct members of the pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL2, CCL5 and CCL7, but not lymphoid chemokines such as CCL21, CCL19, CXCL12 and CXCL13 that are normally expressed in HEV. CCL2 bound to DARC failed to induce a significant cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation in CCR2B-expressing cells, whereas the free form of CCL2 induced a distinct [Ca(2+)] elevation, suggesting that DARC down-regulates activities of pro-inflammatory chemokines upon binding. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding DARC did not induce any obvious changes in the cell number or leukocyte subsets in the peripheral and mesenteric LN. Neither did DARC deficiency significantly affect lymphocyte migration into LN. These results suggest that DARC may be a scavenger for pro-inflammatory chemokines, but not a presenting molecule for lymphoid chemokines at HEV and that it is probably functionally dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking to HEV-bearing lymphoid tissues under physiological conditions.',\n",

In the current study, we focused our efforts to identify the BMD candidate gene in chromosome 1 (Chr 1) QTL that was detected from a cross involving high BMD CAST/EiJ (CAST) and low BMD C57BL/6J (B6) mice. To this end, we have combined several approaches including: (1) fine mapping the BMD QTL in Chr 1 of the B6.CAST F2 female mice using a large number of polymorphic markers; (2) the generation of congenic sublines of mice by repeated backcrossing of CAST with B6 mice and phenotype characterization; (3) expression profiling genes in the QTL region; and (4) SNP analyses to identify the mouse Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (Darc) as a candidate gene for Chr 1 BMD QTL2. We verified the involvement of the Darc protein in BMD variation by evaluating the skeletal phenotype of Darc-knockout mice and congenic sublines of mice carrying small chromosomal segments from CAST BMD QTL. Based on the findings that Darc-antibody blocked formation of multinucleated osteoclasts in vitro and that Darc from CAST binds chemokines, known to regulate osteoclast formation, with reduced affinity compared with Darc from B6 mice, we conclude that Darc regulates BMD negatively by increasing osteoclast formation, and that the genetic association between Darc gene polymorphism and BMD variations in humans merits investigation.']},\n",

Moreover, these cells are capable of the rapid internalization and efficient scavenging of extracellular chemokine, and this is mediated by ACKR2. We also report that in unchallenged DBA/1j mice, Ackr2 deficiency increases the incidence of stillbirth and neonatal death, leads to structural defects in the placenta, and can decrease fetal weight.

Glycosaminidases pre-treatment of the monocyte derived-macrophages strongly decreases the binding of RANTES to syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 and also to CCR5, and abolishes RANTES binding to CD44.

The results of this study show that, within the N-loop, the side chain of R17 is necessary for RANTES binding to CCR1, F12 for binding to CCR3, and F12 and I15 for binding to CCR5, thus forming distinct but overlapping binding epitopes. In addition, our finding that P2 is necessary for binding to CCR5 is the first to show that a residue near the N-terminus of a CC-chemokine is involved in binding to a receptor. We have also found that P2, D6, and T7 near the N-terminus are involved in activating signal transduction via CCR1, P2 and Y3 via CCR3, and Y3 and D6 via CCR5.

Two previously unrecognized MC-chemokine receptors, CCR1 and CCR4, could be identified on cord blood-derived MCs (CBMCs). CCR1 and CCR4 expressed on CBMCs exhibited a unique response profile. Of seven CCR1 and CCR4 agonists tested, only CCL5/RANTES act as an agonist inducing chemotaxis.

Here we show that DARC is selectively expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in the high endothelial venules (HEV) of unstimulated lymph nodes (LN). To examine the biological significance of DARC expression in HEV, we performed competitive binding experiments with 20 different chemokines. The results showed that DARC selectively bound distinct members of the pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL2, CCL5 and CCL7, but not lymphoid chemokines such as CCL21, CCL19, CXCL12 and CXCL13 that are normally expressed in HEV. CCL2 bound to DARC failed to induce a significant cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation in CCR2B-expressing cells, whereas the free form of CCL2 induced a distinct [Ca(2+)] elevation, suggesting that DARC down-regulates activities of pro-inflammatory chemokines upon binding. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding DARC did not induce any obvious changes in the cell number or leukocyte subsets in the peripheral and mesenteric LN. Neither did DARC deficiency significantly affect lymphocyte migration into LN. These results suggest that DARC may be a scavenger for pro-inflammatory chemokines, but not a presenting molecule for lymphoid chemokines at HEV and that it is probably functionally dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking to HEV-bearing lymphoid tissues under physiological conditions.',\n",

It was investigated if this binding profile was reflected in the binding pattern of endothelial cells. Two examples of homeostatic (125I-CXCL12 and 125I-CCL21) and inflammatory (125I-CXCL8 and 125I-CCL5) chemokines were incubated with human synovia. In agreement with the erythrocyte binding data, intense specific signals for CXCL8 and CCL5 binding were found on endothelial cells, whereas CXCL12 and CCL21 showed only weak binding to these cells.

An understanding of the biochemistry and expression patterns of these receptors is therefore central to our overall understanding of the roles played by chemokines in both physiological and pathological processes. To date, eight receptors for the beta-chemokine subfamily have been described. We have recently cloned a novel murine beta-chemokine receptor and report here the identification and characterization of a highly homologous human gene termed human D6 (hD6). This is a promiscuous beta-chemokine receptor and appears to be able to bind the majority of members of the beta-chemokine family. It is, however, specific for this family and shows no detectable affinity for members of the alpha-chemokine or the C or CXXXC chemokines. Unlike the majority of other chemokine receptors, human D6 does not appear to be able to flux calcium following ligand binding, thus it is currently not clear if this novel receptor is indeed a signaling receptor. Human D6 is expressed in a range of tissues including hemopoietic cells although it appears not to be ubiquitously expressed in hemopoietic cells. Human D6, unlike some other beta-chemokine receptors, appears not to be able to function as an entry co-factor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-)1 on CD4-expressing cells.']},\n",

Binding studies with radiolabeled MCP-4 demonstrated a single high affinity binding site with an IC(50) of 0.14 nM. As shown by competition binding, other members of the MCP family also recognized this receptor. MCP-2 was the next most potent ligand, with an IC(50) of 0.45 nM. Surprisingly, eotaxin (IC(50) = 6.7 nM) and MCP-3 (IC(50) = 4.1 nM) bind with greater affinity than MCP-1 (IC(50) = 10.7 nM) but only act as agonists in chemotaxis assays at 100-fold higher concentrations. Because of high affinity binding and functional chemotactic responses, we have termed this receptor CCR11. The gene for CCR11 was localized to human chromosome 3q22, which is distinct from most CC chemokine receptor genes at 3p21. Northern blot hybridization was used to identify CCR11 expression in heart, small intestine, and lung. Thus CCR11 shares functional similarity to CCR2 because it recognizes members of the MCP family, but CCR11 has a distinct expression pattern.']},\n",

Mutual cross-desensitization between CCL2 and vCCL4 was demonstrated in the CCR2-transfected cells.

It is concluded that human herpesvirus 6 encodes a highly selective and efficacious CCR2 agonist, which will attract CCR2 expressing cells, for example macrophages and monocytes, conceivably for the virus to infect and to establish latency in.

We found that MCP-2 could bind to CCR5 transfectants with high affinity and cross-compete effectively with RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta. MCP-2 is a true agonist for CCR5, eliciting a robust chemotactic response in CCR5 transfectants similar to that of the three known CCR5 ligands and exhibiting cross-desensitization with RANTES in the Ca2+ flux response. MCP-4 also bound to CCR5 with high affinity and was efficiently displaced by other CCR5 ligands. However, MCP-4 only partially displaced the binding of radiolabeled MIP-1alpha and caused a chemotactic response only at high concentrations. Furthermore, MCP-2 inhibited the binding of the M-tropic HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein to CCR5 and HIV-1 infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. More importantly, we found that MCP-2 could bind and elicit chemotaxis in CD3-activated and IL-2-maintained T cells, and most of these functions could be specifically inhibited by the anti-CCR5 mAb 2D7, whereas the responses mediated by MIP-1alpha or MCP-4 were only partially inhibited by 2D7. Thus, although MCP-2 can bind to and signal through CCR1, CCR2b, and CCR5, among which both CCR2 and CCR5 are expressed at high levels on activated T cells, it appears to preferably utilize CCR5 on these cells.

Thus, CYR61 promotes primary human fibroblast adhesion, migration, and mitogenesis through integrins alpha(6)beta(1), alpha(v)beta(5), and alpha(v)beta(3), respectively.

However, several members of CCN (CYR61/CTGF/NOV) family of extracellular matrix proteins enable TNFÎ±-dependent apoptosis in vitro without inhibiting NFÎºB or de novo protein synthesis, and CCN1 (CYR61) is essential for optimal TNFÎ± cytotoxicity in vivo. Previous studies showed that CCN1 unmasks the cytotoxicity of TNFÎ± by binding integrins Î±(v)Î²(5), Î±(6)Î²(1), and the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan 4 to induce the accumulation of a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to a biphasic activation of JNK necessary for apoptosis. Here we show for the first time that CCN1 interacts with the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in a protein complex, and that binding to LRP1 is critical for CCN1-induced ROS generation and apoptotic synergism with TNFÎ±. We also found that neutral sphingomyelinase 1 (nSMase1), which contributes to CCN1-induced ROS generation, is required for CCN1/TNFÎ±-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, CCN1 promotes the activation of p53 and p38 MAPK, which mediate enhanced cytochrome c release to amplify the cytotoxicity of TNFÎ±. By contrast, LRP1, nSMase1, p53, and p38 MAPK are not required when TNFÎ±-dependent apoptosis is facilitated by the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that they function in the CCN1 signaling pathway that converges with TNFÎ±-induced signaling events. Since CCN1/CYR61 is a physiological regulator of TNFÎ± cytotoxicity at least in some contexts, these findings may reveal important mediators of TNFÎ±-induced apoptosis in vivo and identify potential therapeutic targets for thwarting TNFÎ±-dependent tissue damage.']},\n",

CCN1 induces fibroblast apoptosis through its adhesion receptors, integrin alpha6beta1 and the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) syndecan-4, triggering the transcription-independent p53 activation of Bax to render cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9 and -3. Neither caspase-8 activity nor de novo transcription or translation is required for this process.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) participates in kidney damage, but whether CCN2 activates the EGFR pathway is unknown. Here, we show that CCN2 is a novel EGFR ligand. CCN2 binding to EGFR extracellular domain was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance. CCN2 contains four distinct structural modules. The carboxyl-terminal module (CCN2(IV)) showed a clear interaction with soluble EGFR, suggesting that EGFR-binding site is located in this module. Injection of CCN2(IV) in mice increased EGFR phosphorylation in the kidney, mainly in tubular epithelial cells. EGFR kinase inhibition decreased CCN2(IV)-induced renal changes (ERK activation and inflammation). Studies in cultured tubular epithelial cells showed that CCN2(IV) binds to EGFR leading to ERK activation and proinflammatory factors overexpression. CCN2 interacts with the neurotrophin receptor TrkA, and EGFR/TrkA receptor crosstalk was found in response to CCN2(IV) stimulation.

Next, we examined the combinational effects of CCN2 and FGF2 on the proliferation of and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and -13 productions by cultured chondrocytes. FGF2 promoted not only the proliferation but also the production of MMP9 and -13, however, combined of FGF2 with CT module nullified the enhancement of both MMP productions and proliferation. To clarify the mechanism, we investigated the binding of CCN2 or its CT module to FGF receptor 1. As a result, we found that CCN2 bound to FGF receptor 1 with a dissociation constant of 362 nm, whereas the CT module did not. In addition, when we tested FGF signaling in chondrocytic HCS-2/8 cells stimulated by the combination of FGF2 with CT module, the level of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation was decreased compared with that found with FGF2 alone.

In this study, we show that cultured rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) produce CTGF(1-4) and CTGF(3-4) following treatment with transforming growth factor-beta and that CTGF is a cell adhesion factor for activated HSCs. Low density lipoprotein receptor-associated protein (LRP) is a receptor for CTGF(1-4) or CTGF(3-4), but not CTGF(4), whereas cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are binding sites for all CTGF isoforms. Prior occupancy of LRP with other LRP ligands, receptor associated protein, anti-LRP, or a thrombospondin type I peptide (TEWSACSKTCG) resulted in a 50% decrease in the adhesion of activated HSCs to CTGF(1-4) or CTGF(3-4) whereas there was no effect on CTGF(4)-mediated adhesion. Co-incubation of CTGF with heparin or perturbation of cell surface HSPGs with heparinase or sodium chlorate completely blocked adhesion of activated HSCs to all CTGF isoforms.

Thus HSC adhesion is at least partially promoted by CTGF through its binding to LRP, a process that is heparin-dependent. CTGF-LRP interactions are likely mediated by module 3 and CTGF-heparin interactions occur principally in module 4, although additional motifs may account for the heparin-dependency of LRP binding.

In contrast, CCN3-induced cell migration is dependent on integrins alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1, whereas alpha6beta1 does not play a role in this process. Although CCN3 does not contain a RGD sequence, it binds directly to immobilized integrins alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1, with half-maximal binding occurring at 10 nm and 50 nm CCN3, respectively. Furthermore, CCN3 induces neovascularization when implanted in rat cornea, demonstrating that it is a novel angiogenic inducer. Together, these findings show that CCN3 is a ligand of integrins alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1, acts directly upon endothelial cells to stimulate pro-angiogenic activities, and induces angiogenesis in vivo.\"]},\n",

We found that herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) was a ligand of CD160 that acted as a 'bidirectional switch' for T cell activation, producing a positive or negative outcome depending on the engagement of HVEM by CD160 and known HVEM ligands such as B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and the T lymphocyte receptor LIGHT. Inhibition of CD4+ T cell activation by HVEM-transfected cells was dependent on CD160 and BTLA; when the cysteine-rich domain 1 of HVEM was deleted, this inhibition was lost, resulting in strong T cell activation. CD160 thus serves as a negative regulator of CD4+ T cell activation through its interaction with HVEM.\",\n",

To date, the detailed properties of the formation of these complexes, especially HVEM binding to the newly identified receptor CD160, and the relationship of CD160 with BTLA and LIGHT are still unclear. We performed N-terminal sequencing and a mass spectrometric analysis, which revealed that the extracellular domain of CD160 exists primarily in the monomeric form. The surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that CD160 binds directly to the cysteine-rich domain 1-3 of HVEM with a similar affinity to, but slower dissociation rate than, that of BTLA. Notably, CD160 competed with BTLA for binding to HVEM; in contrast, LIGHT did not affect HVEM binding to either CD160 or BTLA. The results of a mutagenesis study of HVEM also suggest that the CD160 binding region on HVEM was slightly different from, but overlapped with, the BTLA binding site. Interestingly, an anti-CD160 antibody exhibiting antiangiogenic properties blocked CD160/HVEM binding.

Using soluble CD22-immunoglobulin fusion proteins and T cells expressing wild-type and chimeric CD45 forms, we show that engagement of CD45 by soluble CD22 can modulate early T-cell signals in antigen receptor/CD3-mediated stimulation. We also show that addition of sialic acid by beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase to the CD22 molecule abrogates interactions between CD22 and its ligands. Together, these observations provide direct evidence for a functional role of the interaction between the extracellular domain of CD45 and a natural ligand and suggest another regulatory mechanism for CD22-mediated ligand engagement.']},\n",

Identification of the ligands that induce the rolling of cells is thus critical to understanding how cancers metastasize. We have previously demonstrated that MCF-7 cells, human breast cancer cells, exhibit the rolling response selectively on E-selectin-immobilized surfaces. However, the ligand that induces rolling of MCF-7 cells on E-selectin has not yet been identified, as these cells lack commonly known E-selectin ligands. Here we report, for the first time to our knowledge, a set of quantitative and direct evidence demonstrating that CD24 expressed on MCF-7 cell membranes is responsible for rolling of the cells on E-selectin. The binding kinetics between CD24 and E-selectin was directly measured using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which revealed that CD24 has a binding affinity against E-selectin (K(D) = 3.4 Â± 0.7 nM). The involvement of CD24 in MCF-7 cell rolling was confirmed by the rolling behavior that was completely blocked when cells were treated with anti-CD24. A simulated study by flowing microspheres coated with CD24 onto E-selectin-immobilized surfaces further revealed that the binding is Ca(2+)-dependent. Additionally, we have found that actin filaments are involved in the CD24-mediated cell rolling, as observed by the decreased rolling velocities of the MCF-7 cells upon treatment with cytochalasin D (an inhibitor of actin-filament dynamics) and the stationary binding of CD24-coated microspheres (the lack of actins) on the E-selectin-immobilized slides. Given that CD24 is known to be directly related to enhanced invasiveness of cancer cells, our results imply that CD24-based cell rolling on E-selectin mediates, at least partially, cancer cell extravasation, resulting in metastasis.']},\n",

We show that absence of CD40L affects the stability of arterial thrombi and delays arterial occlusion in vivo. Infusion of recombinant soluble (rs)CD40L restored normal thrombosis, whereas rsCD40L lacking the KGD integrin-recognition sequence did not. CD40-deficient mice exhibited normal thrombogenesis. rsCD40L specifically bound to purified integrin alphaIIbbeta3 and to activated platelets in a beta3-dependent manner and induced platelet spreading. In addition, rsCD40L promoted the aggregation of either human or mouse platelets under high shear rates.

From the distance dependence of the protein-protein interaction potential, we demonstrate directly that the full-length extracellular domains adhere in a head-to-head orientation. The absence of long-range electrostatic protein-protein attraction further indicates that the salt bridges between the binding surfaces only influence the interaction at short range. Despite the loss of a stabilizing disulfide bond in domain 1 (D1) of CD2, adhesive failure occurs abruptly with no evidence of partial protein unfolding during detachment. Finally, these measurements between extended membrane surfaces directly confirm that the low-affinity CD2-CD48 bond generates weak adhesion and that lateral receptor mobility is required for the development of appreciable adhesion. This is the first direct measurement of the range and magnitude of the forces governing heterotypic adhesion mediated by cell surface proteins.

This designed site with ligand residues exclusively from the beta-sheets selectively binds to Ca2+ and Ln3+ over other mono- and divalent cations. While Ca2+ and Ln3+ binding specifically alters the local environment of the designed Ca2+-binding site, the designed protein undergoes a significantly smaller conformation change compared with those observed in naturally occurring Ca2+-binding sites that are composed of at least part of the flexible loop and helical regions.

CD52-Fc bound specifically to the proinflammatory Box B domain of HMGB1, and this in turn promoted binding of the CD52 N-linked glycan, in Î±-2,3 sialic acid linkage with galactose, to Siglec-10. Suppression of T cell function was blocked by anti-HMGB1 antibody or the antiinflammatory Box A domain of HMGB1. CD52-Fc induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Siglec-10 and was recovered from T cells complexed with HMGB1 and Siglec-10 in association with SHP1 phosphatase and the T cell receptor (TCR). Thus, soluble CD52 exerts a concerted immunosuppressive effect by first sequestering HMGB1 to nullify its proinflammatory Box B, followed by binding to the inhibitory Siglec-10 receptor, triggering recruitment of SHP1 to the intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif of Siglec-10 and its interaction with the TCR. This mechanism may contribute to immune-inflammatory homeostasis in pathophysiologic states and underscores the potential of soluble CD52 as a therapeutic agent.']},\n",

CD84-Ig bound to CD84-transfected cells, whereas no binding was detected with cells expressing other CD2 subfamily receptors, showing that CD84 binds to itself. Anti-CD84 mAbs recognizing epitopes wholly within domain 1 of CD84 blocked the binding of the CD84-Ig fusion protein to CD84-transfected cells and platelets. Data from CD84 domain human/mouse chimeras further revealed that only the first extracellular domain of the molecule is involved in the ligand receptor recognition. The CD84-CD84 interaction was independent of its cytoplasmic tail. Finally, concurrent ligation of human CD84 with mAbs or CD84-Ig and CD3 enhanced IFN-gamma secretion in human lymphocytes.

We explored the role of CD80 and CD86 in the homeostasis and proliferation of CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg), which constitutively express high levels of CTLA-4 yet are critically dependent upon CD28 signals. We observed that CD86 was the dominant ligand for Treg proliferation, survival, and maintenance of a regulatory phenotype, with higher expression of CTLA-4, ICOS, and OX40. We also explored whether CD80-CD28 interactions were specifically compromised by CTLA-4 and found that antibody blockade, clinical deficiency of CTLA-4 and CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of CTLA-4 all improved Treg survival following CD80 stimulation. Taken together, our data suggest that CD86 is the dominant costimulatory ligand for Treg homeostasis, despite its lower affinity for CD28, because CD80-CD28 interactions are selectively impaired by the high levels of CTLA-4. These data suggest a cell intrinsic role for CTLA-4 in regulating CD28 costimulation by direct competition for CD80, and indicate that that CD80 and CD86 have discrete roles in CD28 costimulation of CD4 T cells in the presence of high levels of CTLA-4.',\n",

We find that E-cadherin ligation alone reduces the frequency of cells entering the S phase, demonstrating that E-cadherin ligation directly transduces growth inhibitory signals. E-cadherin binding to beta-catenin is required for cell growth inhibition, but beta-catenin/T-cell factor transcriptional activity is not involved in growth inhibition resulting from homophilic binding. Neither E-cadherin binding to p120-catenin nor beta-catenin binding to alpha-catenin, and thereby the actin cytoskeleton, is required for growth inhibition. E-cadherin ligation also inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-mediated growth signaling by a beta-catenin-dependent mechanism. It does not affect EGF receptor autophosphorylation or activation of ERK, but it inhibits transphosphorylation of Tyr845 and activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 5.

However, the discovery of antigens associated with pancreatic cancer cells has recently suggested the possibility that immunotherapy might become a specific and effective therapeutic option. T cells within many epithelia, including those of the pancreas, are known to express the alphaEbeta7-integrin adhesion molecule, CD103. The only characterised ligand for CD103 is E-cadherin, an epithelial adhesion molecule which exhibits reduced expression in pancreatic cancer. In our study, CD103 was found to be expressed only by activated T cells following exposure to tumour necrosis factor beta 1, a factor produced by many cancer cells. Significantly, the expression of this integrin was restricted mainly to class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD8+ T cells. The human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 was transfected with human E-cadherin in order to generate E-cadherin negative (wild type) and positive (transfected) sub-lines. Using a sensitive flow cytometric adhesion assay it was found that the expression of both CD103 (on T cells) and E-cadherin (on cancer cells) was essential for efficient adhesion of activated T cells to pancreatic cancer cells. This adhesion process was inhibited by the addition of antibodies specific for CD103, thereby demonstrating the importance of the CD103-->E-cadherin interaction for T-cell adhesion. Using a 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assay it was found that CD103 expressing T cells lysed E-cadherin expressing Panc-1 target cells following T cell receptor stimulation; addition of antibodies specific for CD103 significantly reduced this lysis. Furthermore, absence of either CD103 from the T cells or E-cadherin expression from the cancer cells resulted in a significant reduction in cancer cell lysis. Therefore, potentially antigenic pancreatic cancer cells could evade a local anti-cancer immune response in vivo as a consequence of their loss of E-cadherin expression; this phenotypic change may also favour metastasis by reducing homotypic adhesion between adjacent cancer cells. We conclude that effective immunotherapy is likely to require upregulation of E-cadherin expression by pancreatic cancer cells or the development of cytotoxic immune cells that are less dependent on this adhesion molecule for efficient effecter function.',\n",

Whereas E-cadherin is expressed in most epithelium and carcinomas, recent studies suggest that the up-regulation of other cadherin subtypes in carcinomas, such as N-cadherin, may function in cancer progression. We demonstrate that a signal transduction cascade links the N-cadherin.catenin adhesion complex to up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In suspension, aggregates of DU-145 cells, an E-cadherin expressing human prostate carcinoma line, survive loss of integrin-dependent adhesion by a different anti-apoptotic signaling pathway than the N-cadherin expressing lines PC3 and PC3N. N-cadherin intercellular adhesion mediates a 3.5-fold increase in Bcl-2 protein expression, whereas the level of the proapoptotic protein Bax remains constant. Only N-cadherin ligation in PC3 cells, which express both N-cadherin and E-cadherin, is sufficient to induce activation of Akt/protein kinase B. N-cadherin homophilic ligation initiates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent activation of Akt resulting in Akt phosphorylation of Bad on serine 136. Following N-cadherin homophilic adhesion phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was identified in immunoprecipitates of the N-cadherin.catenin complex. The recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the adhesion complex is dependent on ligation of N-cadherin and an organized actin cytoskeleton because cytochalasin D blocks the recruitment. We propose that N-cadherin homophilic adhesion can initiate anti-apoptotic signaling, which enhances the Akt cell survival pathway in metastatic cancer.']},\n",

Here, we report that the first 2 extracellular domains of cadherin are sufficient to initiate a KLRG1-dependent signaling. We also demonstrate that KLRG1 engagement inhibits cadherin-dependent cellular adhesion and influences dendritic cell secretion of inflammatory cytokines, thereby exerting immunosuppressive effects. Consistent with this, engagement of cadherin by KLRG1 molecule induces cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, KLRG1/cadherin interaction leads to the generation of a bidirectional signal in which both KLRG1 and cadherin activate downstream signaling cascades simultaneously. Taken together, our results provide novel insights on how KLRG1 and E-cadherin interactions are integrated to differentially regulate not only KLRG1(+) cells, but also E-cadherin-expressing cells, such as dendritic cells.']},\n",

The inhibition of the X-dimer was crucial for the overall inhibitory effect, raising the therapeutic value of a kinetic intermediary not only for preventing, but also for reversing, cell adhesion mediated by a member of the classical cadherin family.

It has become clear that neutrophils also modulate adaptive immunity through interactions with dendritic cells (DCs) that are pivotal in the induction of T cell responses. Upon activation, neutrophils release TNF-alpha and induce maturation of DCs that enables these antigen-presenting cells to stimulate T cell proliferation and to induce T helper 1 polarization. DC maturation by neutrophils also requires cellular interactions that are mediated by binding of the DC-specific receptor DC-SIGN to Mac-1 on the neutrophil. Here, we demonstrate that also CEACAM1 is an important ligand for DC-SIGN on neutrophils. Binding of DC-SIGN to both CEACAM1 and Mac-1 is required to establish cellular interactions with neutrophils. DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin that has specificity for Lewis(x), and we show that DC-SIGN mediates binding to CEACAM1 through Lewis(x) moieties that are specifically expressed on CEACAM1 derived from neutrophils. This indicates that glycosylation-driven binding of both Mac-1 and CEACAM1 to DC-SIGN is essential for interactions of neutrophils with DCs and enables neutrophils to modulate T cell responses through interactions with DCs.',\n",

Since Lex residues of pathogens bind to the C-type lectin dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) expressed on human DCs, we hypothesized that Lex glycans of CEACAM1 are recognized by DC-SIGN. Here, we demonstrate that CEACAM1, the major carrier of Lex residues in human granulocytes, is specifically recognized by DC-SIGN via Lex residues mediating the internalization of CEACAM1 into immature DCs. Expression studies with CEACAM1 in combination with different fucosyltransferases (FUTs) revealed that FUTIX plays a key role in the synthesis of Lex groups of CEACAM1.

These inhibitory effects were accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) of CEACAM1 and by recruitment of the phosphatase SHP-1, which could negatively regulate Toll-like receptor 2-dependent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase-Akt kinase pathway.

Although some BSDL is transported to blood, the role of circulating BSDL is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that BSDL is stored in platelets and released upon platelet activation. Because BSDL contains a region that is structurally homologous to the V3 loop of HIV-1, which binds to CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), we hypothesized that BSDL might bind to CXCR4 present on platelets. In human platelets in vitro, both BSDL and a peptide corresponding to its V3-like loop induced calcium mobilization and enhanced thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation, spreading, and activated alpha(IIb)beta(3) levels. These effects were abolished by CXCR4 inhibition. BSDL also increased the production of prostacyclin by human endothelial cells. In a mouse thrombosis model, BSDL accumulated at sites of vessel wall injury. When CXCR4 was antagonized, the accumulation of BSDL was inhibited and thrombus size was reduced. In BSDL(-/-) mice, calcium mobilization in platelets and thrombus formation were attenuated and tail bleeding times were increased in comparison with those of wild-type mice. We conclude that BSDL plays a role in optimal platelet activation and thrombus formation by interacting with CXCR4 on platelets.']},\n",

Of note, treatment with anti-KIAA1199 mAb effectively alleviated the severity of arthritis and reduced serum LMW-HA levels and cytokine secretion in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. In vitro, sKIAA1199 was shown to mediate exogenous HA degradation by attaching to the cell membrane of RA fibroblast-like synoviosytes (RA FLS). Furthermore, the HA-degrading activity of sKIAA1199 depended largely on its adhesion to the membrane, which was achieved by its G8 domain binding to ANXA1. In vivo, kiaa1199-KO mice exhibited greater resistance to collagen-induced arthritis. Interestingly, this resistance could be partially reversed by intra-articular injection of vectors encoding full-length KIAA1199 instead of G8-deleted KIAA119 mutant, which further confirmed the indispensable role of G8 domain in KIAA1199 involvement in RA pathological processes. Mechanically, the activation of NF-ÎºB by interleukin-6 (IL-6) through PI3K/Akt signaling is suggested to be the main pathway to induce KIAA1199 expression in RA FLS.

For example, glycosylation-dependent cell-adhesion molecule 1 (GlyCAM-1), a known ligand for L-selectin, has been shown to enhance beta2-integrin function. GlyCAM-1 is a secreted protein and is present in mouse serum at a concentration of approx. 1.5 microg/ml. There is no obvious GlyCAM-1 homologue in man and, to date, L-selectin ligand(s) from human serum have not been characterized. Therefore we have used L-selectin affinity chromatography, followed by ion-exchange chromatography, to isolate specific ligand(s) for L-selectin. Using this procedure, we have isolated three major glycoproteins of apparent molecular masses 170 kDa, 70kDa and 50 kDa. The 170 kDa protein band was digested with trypsin and peptides were analysed by delayed extraction matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS and protein database searching. The 170 kDa protein was identified as the human complement protein Factor H.

Only a part of the purified Factor H preparation bound to immobilized L-selectin. The interaction of Factor H with leukocyte L-selectin was shown to induce the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Pretreatment of Factor H with sialidase reduced both the binding of L-selectin to Factor H and the Factor H-induced L-selectin-mediated TNF-alpha secretion by leukocytes.

The exodomain binds the hormone with high affinity, and the resulting hormone/exodomain complex modulates the endodomain where receptor activation occurs. It has been an enigma whether the hormone interacts with the endodomain. In a step to address the question, exoloop 3 of (580)KVPLITVSKAK(590) was examined by Ala scan, multiple substitution, assays for hormone binding, cAMP and inositol phosphate (IP) induction, and photoaffinity labeling. We present the evidence for the interaction of FSH and exoloop 3. A peptide mimic of exoloop 3 specifically and saturably photoaffinity-labels FSH alpha but not FSH beta. This is in contrast to photoaffinity labeling of FSH beta by the peptide mimic of the N-terminal region of the receptor. Leu(583) and Ile(584) are crucial for the interaction of FSH and exoloop 3. Substitutions of these two residues enhanced the hormone binding affinity. This is due to the loss of the original side chains but not the introduction of new side chains. The Leu(583) and Ile(584) side chains appear to project in opposite directions. Ile(584) appears to be so specific and to require flexibility and stereo specificity so that no other amino acids can fit into its place. Leu(583) is less specific. The improvement in hormone binding by substitutions was offset by the severe impairment of signal generation of cAMP and/or inositol phosphate. For example, the Phe or Tyr substitution of Leu(583) improved the hormone binding and cAMP induction but impaired IP induction. On the other hand, the substitutions for Ile(584) and Lys(590) abolished the cAMP and IP induction. Our results open a logical question whether Leu(583), Ile(584), and Lys(590) interact with the exodomain and/or the hormone.

The hormone is bound in a hand-clasp fashion to an elongated, curved receptor. The buried interface of the complex is large (2,600 A2) and has a high charge density. Our analysis suggests that all glycoprotein hormones bind to their receptors in this mode and that binding specificity is mediated by key interaction sites involving both the common alpha- and hormone-specific beta-subunits. On binding, FSH undergoes a concerted conformational change that affects protruding loops implicated in receptor activation. The FSH-FSHR(HB) complexes form dimers in the crystal and at high concentrations in solution. Such dimers may participate in transmembrane signal transduction.',\n",

This domain is connected to a structure containing seven putative transmembrane segments which displays sequence similarity to G protein-coupled receptors. Thus, the FSH-R is identical in its structural design to the LH/CG receptor (LH/CG-R). Furthermore, both receptors display 50% sequence similarity in their large extracellular domains and 80% identity across the seven transmembrane segments.

We focused on a primate-specific additional exon in the hinge region, which is located between LRRD and the serpentine domain.

Furthermore, the region(s) of clusterin involved in these many binding interactions remain(s) to be identified. As part of an investigation of these issues, we expressed recombinant human clusterin in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The resultant protein had variable proteolytic truncations of the C-terminal region of the alpha-chain and the N-terminal region of the beta-chain. We compared the chaperone and ligand binding activities of this recombinant product with those of clusterin purified from human serum. We also tested whether the binding of clusterin to ligands could be inhibited by competitive binding with other clusterin ligands or by anti-clusterin monoclonal antibodies. Collectively, our results indicate that (i) clusterin has three independent classes of binding sites for LRP-2, stressed proteins, and unstressed ligands, respectively, and (ii) the binding sites for LRP-2 and stressed proteins are likely to be in parts of the molecule other than the C-terminal region of the alpha-chain or the N-terminal region of the beta-chain. It has been suggested that, in vivo, clusterin binds to toxic molecules in the extracellular environment and carries these to cells expressing LRP-2 for uptake and degradation.

       "   'Glycoprotein 330 (gp330) is a member of a family of endocytic receptors related to the low density lipoprotein receptor. gp330 has previously been shown to bind a number of ligands in common with its family member, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). To identify ligands specific for gp330 and relevant to its localization on epithelia such as in the mammary gland, gp330-Sepharose affinity chromatography was performed. As a result, a 70-kDa protein was selected from human milk and identified by protein sequencing to be apolipoprotein J/clusterin (apoJ). Solid-phase binding assays confirmed that gp330 bound to apoJ with high affinity (Kd = 14.2 nM). Similarly, gp330 bound to apoJ transferred to nitrocellulose after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. LRP, however, showed no binding to apoJ in either type of assay. The binding of gp330 to apoJ could be competitively inhibited with excess apoJ as well as with the gp330 ligands apolipoprotein E, lipoprotein lipase, and the receptor-associated protein, a 39-kDa protein that acts to antagonize binding of all known ligands for gp330 and LRP. Several cultured cell lines that express gp330 and ones that do not express the receptor were examined for their ability to bind and internalize 125I-apoJ. Only cells that expressed gp330 endocytosed and degraded radiolabeled apoJ. Furthermore, F9 cells treated with retinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic AMP to increase expression levels of gp330 displayed an increased capacity to internalize and degrade apoJ. Cellular internalization and degradation of radiolabeled apoJ could be inhibited with unlabeled apoJ, receptor-associated protein, and gp330 antibodies. The results indicate that gp330 but not LRP can bind to apoJ in vitro and that gp330 expressed by cells can mediate apoJ endocytosis leading to lysosomal degradation.']},\n",

Bound cytokine is revealed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin. Purified human and rat CNTF competed with biotinylated CNTF for receptor binding, with IC50 values of 29 and 2 nM, respectively. Since the higher affinity of rat vs human CNTF has been previously shown to be conferred by the arginine residue at position 63 of the rat protein, we also tested a human CNTF mutant carrying a Q63R substitution. Secreted forms of wild-type and mutant CNTF were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the amount of cytokines in periplasmic extracts was determined by quantitative Western blotting analysis. The human CNTF mutant (Q63R, N137S) was found to compete with biotinylated CNTF for binding to soluble CNTF receptor with an eightfold higher apparent affinity than wild-type human CNTF.

Similar results were obtained in the JEG cell line, which only expressed the gp130/gp190 high-affinity LIF receptor, by adding a soluble form of the alpha CNTF receptor to the system to reconstitute the high-affinity-type CNTF receptor.

These autoantibodies are mostly of the IgG4 isotype, but their pathogenicity has not been proven. Here, we investigated the mechanisms how IgG subclasses to contactin-1 affect conduction. We show that purified anti-contactin-1 IgG1 and IgG4 bind to paranodes. To determine whether these isotypes can pass the paranodal barrier, we incubated isolated sciatic nerves with the purified antibody or performed intraneural injections. We found that IgG4 diffused into the paranodal regions in vitro or after intraneural injections. IgG4 infiltration was slow and progressive. In 24 h, IgG4 accessed the paranode borders near the nodal lumen, and completely fill the paranodal segments by 3 days. By contrast, control IgG, anti-contactin-1 IgG1, or even anti-contactin-associated-protein-2 IgG4 did not pass the paranodal barrier. To determine whether chronic exposure to these antibodies is pathogenic, we passively transferred anti-contactin-1 IgG1 and IgG4 into Lewis rats immunized with P2 peptide. IgG4 to contactin-1, but not IgG1, induced progressive clinical deteriorations combined with gait ataxia. No demyelination, axonal degeneration, or immune infiltration were observed. Instead, these animals presented a selective loss of the paranodal specialization in motor neurons characterized by the disappearance of the contactin-associated protein 1/contactin-1/neurofascin-155 complex at paranodes. Paranode destruction did not affect nodal specialization, but resulted in a moderate node lengthening. The sensory nerves and dorsal root ganglion were not affected in these animals. Electrophysiological examination further supported these results and revealed strong nerve activity loss affecting predominantly small diameter or slow conducting motor axons. These deficits partly matched with those found in patients: proximal motor involvement, gait ataxia, and a demyelinating neuropathy that showed early axonal features. The animal model thus seemed to replicate the early deteriorations in these patients and pointed out that paranodal loss in mature fibres results in conduction defects, but not conduction slowing. Our findings indicate that IgG4 directed against contactin-1 are pathogenic and are reliable biomarkers of a specific subset of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy patients.

We identified 10 individuals from six unrelated families, exhibiting a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized with a spectrum of central (intellectual disability, developmental delay, motor impairment, speech difficulties) and peripheral (early onset demyelinating neuropathy) neurological involvement, who were found by exome or genome sequencing to carry one frameshift and four different homozygous non-synonymous variants in NFASC. Expression studies using immunostaining-based techniques identified absent expression of the Nfasc155 isoform as a consequence of the frameshift variant and a significant reduction of expression was also observed in association with two non-synonymous variants affecting the fibronectin type III domain. Cell aggregation studies revealed a severely impaired Nfasc155-CNTN1/CASPR1 complex interaction as a result of the identified variants. Immunofluorescence staining of myelinated fibres from two affected individuals showed a severe loss of myelinated fibres and abnormalities in the paranodal junction morphology.

Using epitope labeling and fragments, we assign the F58C, L1, and L2 domains to the large lobe, the FBG and L3 domains to the middle lobe, and the L4 domain to the small lobe of the CNTNAP2 molecular envelope. Our data reveal that CNTNAP2 has a very different architecture compared with neurexin 1Î±, a fellow member of the neurexin superfamily and a prototype, suggesting that CNTNAP2 uses a different strategy to integrate into the synaptic protein network. We show that the ectodomains of CNTNAP2 and contactin 2 (CNTN2) bind directly and specifically, with low nanomolar affinity. We show further that mutations in CNTNAP2 implicated in autism spectrum disorder are not segregated but are distributed over the whole ectodomain.

When presented as a substratum for neuronal cultures it strongly promotes neurite outgrowth from chicken embryonic dorsal root ganglia neurons. In this study, the axon-associated cell adhesion molecule G4, which is identical with Ng-CAM and 8D9, and homologous or closely related to L1 of the mouse and NILE of the rat, was investigated with respect to a receptor function for axonin-1. Using fluorescent microspheres with covalently coupled axonin-1 or L1(G4) at their surface we showed that these proteins bind to each other. Within the sensitivity of this microsphere assay, no interaction of axonin-1 with itself could be detected. Axonin-1-coated microspheres also bound to the neurites of cultured dorsal root ganglia neurons. This interaction was exclusively mediated by L1(G4), as indicated by complete binding suppression by monovalent anti-L1(G4) antibodies. The interaction between neuritic L1(G4) and immobilized axonin-1 was found to mediate the promotion of neurite growth on axonin-1, as evidenced by the virtually complete arrest of neurite outgrowth in the presence of anti-L1(G4) antibodies. Convincing evidence has recently been presented that neurite growth on L1(8D9) is mediated by the homophilic binding of neuritic L1(G4) (1989. Neuron. 2: 1597-1603). Thus, both L1(G4)- and axonin-1-expressing axons may serve as \"substrate pathways\" for the guidance of following axons expressing L1(G4) into their target area. Conceivably, differences in the concentration of axonin-1 and L1(G4), and/or modulatory influences on their specific binding parameters in leading pathways and following axons could represent elements in the control of axonal pathway selection.',\n",
       "   'The neuronal cell adhesion molecule axonin-1 is composed of six immunoglobulin and four fibronectin type III domains. Axonin-1 promotes neurite outgrowth, when presented as a substratum for neurons in vitro, via a neuronal receptor that has been identified as the neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule, NgCAM, based on the blocking effect of polyclonal antibodies directed to NgCAM. Here we report the identification of axonin-1 domains involved in NgCAM binding. NgCAM-conjugated microspheres were tested for binding to COS cells expressing domain deletion mutants of axonin-1. In addition, monoclonal antibodies directed to axonin-1 were assessed for their ability to block the axonin-1-NgCAM interaction, and their epitopes were mapped using the domain deletion mutants. The results suggest that the four amino-terminal immunoglobulin domains of axonin-1 form a domain conglomerate which is necessary and sufficient for NgCAM binding. Surprisingly, NgCAM binding to membrane-bound axonin-1 was increased strongly by deletion of the fifth or sixth immunoglobulin domains of axonin-1. Based on these results and on negative staining electron microscopy, we propose a horseshoe-shaped domain arrangement of axonin-1 that obscures the NgCAM binding site. Neurite outgrowth studies with truncated forms of axonin-1 show that axonin-1 is a neurite outgrowth-promoting substratum in the absence of the NgCAM binding site.']},\n",

This interaction involves an 85-95-kD class of lymphocyte surface glycoprotein(s), CD44. A subset of lymphocyte CD44 molecules is modified by covalent linkage to chondroitin sulfate (Jalkanen, S., M. Jalkanen, R. Bargatze, M. Tammi, and E. C. Butcher. 1988. J. Immunol. 141:1615-1623).

Affinity-purified CD44 antigen was, on the other hand, observed to bind native Type I collagen fibrils, laminin, and fibronectin, but not gelatin. Binding to fibronectin was studied more closely, and it was found to be mediated through the chondroitin sulfate-containing form of the molecule. The binding site on fibronectin was the COOH-terminal heparin binding domain, because (a) the COOH-terminal heparin-binding fragment of fibronectin-bound isolated CD44 antigen; (b) chondroitin sulfate inhibited this binding; and (c) finally, the ectodomain of another cell surface proteoglycan, syndecan, which is known to bind the COOH-terminal heparin binding domain of fibronectin (Saunders, S., and M. Bernfield. 1988. J. Cell Biol. 106: 423-430), inhibited binding of CD44 both to intact fibronectin and to its heparin binding domain. Moreover, inhibition studies showed that binding of a lymphoblastoid cell line, KCA, to heparin binding peptides from COOH-terminal heparin binding fragment of fibronectin was mediated via CD44. These findings suggest that recirculating lymphocytes use the CD44 class of molecules not only for binding to HEV at the site of lymphocyte entry to lymphoid organs as reported earlier but also within the lymphatic tissue where CD44, especially the subset modified by chondroitin sulfate, is used for interaction with extracellular matrix molecules such as fibronectin.']},\n",

       "  'Abstracts': ['The discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed in breast carcinoma cells. Upon binding to collagen, DDR1 undergoes autophosphorylation followed by limited proteolysis to generate a tyrosine phosphorylated C-terminal fragment (CTF). Although it was postulated that this fragment is formed as a result of shedding of the N-terminal ectodomain, collagen-dependent release of the DDR1 extracellular domain has not been demonstrated. We now report that, in conjunction with CTF formation, collagen type I stimulates concentration-dependent, saturable shedding of the DDR1 ectodomain from two carcinoma cell lines, and from transfected cells. In contrast, collagen did not promote cleavage of other transmembrane proteins including the amyloid precursor protein (APP), ErbB2, and E-cadherin. Collagen-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and proteolysis of DDR1 in carcinoma cells were reduced by a pharmacologic Src inhibitor. Moreover, expression of a dominant negative Src mutant protein in human embryonic kidney cells inhibited collagen-dependent phosphorylation and shedding of co-transfected DDR1. The hydroxamate-based metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI-1 (tumor necrosis factor-alpha protease inhibitor-1), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-3, also blocked collagen-evoked DDR1 shedding, but did not reduce levels of the phosphorylated CTF. Neither shedding nor CTF formation were affected by the gamma-secretase inhibitor, L-685,458. The results demonstrate that collagen-evoked ectodomain cleavage of DDR1 is mediated in part by Src-dependent activation or recruitment of a matrix- or disintegrin metalloproteinase, and that CTF formation can occur independently of ectodomain shedding. Delayed shedding of the DDR1 ectodomain may represent a mechanism that limits DDR1-dependent cell adhesion and migration on collagen matrices.',\n",

Various collagen types bind to and activate the DDRs, but the molecular details of collagen recognition have not been well defined. In this study, recombinant extracellular domains of DDR1 and DDR2 were produced to explore DDR-collagen binding in detail. In solid phase assays, both DDRs bound collagen I with high affinity. DDR1 recognized collagen I only as a dimeric and not as a monomeric construct, indicating a requirement for receptor dimerization in the DDR1-collagen interaction. The DDRs contain a discoidin homology domain in their extracellular domains, and the isolated discoidin domain of DDR2 bound collagen I with high affinity. Furthermore, the discoidin domain of DDR2, but not of DDR1, was sufficient for transmembrane receptor signaling. To map the collagen binding site within the discoidin domain of DDR2, mutant constructs were created, in which potential surface-exposed loops in DDR2 were exchanged for the corresponding loops of functionally unrelated discoidin domains. Three spatially adjacent surface loops within the DDR2 discoidin domain were found to be critically involved in collagen binding of the isolated DDR2 extracellular domain. In addition, the same loops were required for collagen-dependent receptor activation. It is concluded that the loop region opposite to the polypeptide chain termini of the DDR2 discoidin domain constitutes the collagen recognition site.',\n",

Collagen activation of DDR1 induces phosphorylation of a docking site for the Shc phosphotyrosine binding domain, whose presence is controlled by alternative splicing. Activation of DDR2 by collagen results in the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression.

They belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and share 64% homology at the protein level. Functional evidence demonstrating the identity of the recombinant protein with GPVI was shown by binding to its natural ligand collagen; binding to convulxin (Cvx), a GPVI-specific ligand from snake venom; binding of anti-GPVI IgG isolated from a patient; and association to the FcR-gamma chain.

Osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR) was proposed to be a potent FcRÎ³-associated costimulatory receptor expressed by preosteoclasts in vitro, but OSCAR lacks a cognate ligand and its role in vivo has been unclear. Using samples from mice and patients deficient in various ITAM signaling pathways, we show here that OSCAR costimulates one of the major FcRÎ³-associated pathways required for osteoclastogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, we found that OSCAR binds to specific motifs within fibrillar collagens in the ECM that become revealed on nonquiescent bone surfaces in which osteoclasts undergo maturation and terminal differentiation in vivo. OSCAR promoted osteoclastogenesis in vivo, and OSCAR binding to its collagen motif led to signaling that increased numbers of osteoclasts in culture. Thus, our results suggest that ITAM-containing receptors can respond to exposed ligands in collagen, leading to the functional differentiation of leukocytes, which provides what we believe to be a new concept for ITAM regulation of cytokine receptors in different tissue microenvironments.']},\n",

This interaction involves an 85-95-kD class of lymphocyte surface glycoprotein(s), CD44. A subset of lymphocyte CD44 molecules is modified by covalent linkage to chondroitin sulfate (Jalkanen, S., M. Jalkanen, R. Bargatze, M. Tammi, and E. C. Butcher. 1988. J. Immunol. 141:1615-1623). In this work, we show that removal of chondroitin sulfate by chondroitinase treatment of lymphocytes or incubation of HEV with chondroitin sulfate does not significantly inhibit lymphocyte binding to HEV, suggesting that chondroitin sulfate is not involved in endothelial cell recognition of lymphocytes. Affinity-purified CD44 antigen was, on the other hand, observed to bind native Type I collagen fibrils, laminin, and fibronectin, but not gelatin. Binding to fibronectin was studied more closely, and it was found to be mediated through the chondroitin sulfate-containing form of the molecule. The binding site on fibronectin was the COOH-terminal heparin binding domain, because (a) the COOH-terminal heparin-binding fragment of fibronectin-bound isolated CD44 antigen; (b) chondroitin sulfate inhibited this binding; and (c) finally, the ectodomain of another cell surface proteoglycan, syndecan, which is known to bind the COOH-terminal heparin binding domain of fibronectin (Saunders, S., and M. Bernfield. 1988. J. Cell Biol. 106: 423-430), inhibited binding of CD44 both to intact fibronectin and to its heparin binding domain. Moreover, inhibition studies showed that binding of a lymphoblastoid cell line, KCA, to heparin binding peptides from COOH-terminal heparin binding fragment of fibronectin was mediated via CD44. These findings suggest that recirculating lymphocytes use the CD44 class of molecules not only for binding to HEV at the site of lymphocyte entry to lymphoid organs as reported earlier but also within the lymphatic tissue where CD44, especially the subset modified by chondroitin sulfate, is used for interaction with extracellular matrix molecules such as fibronectin.']},\n",

Upon binding to collagen, DDR1 undergoes autophosphorylation followed by limited proteolysis to generate a tyrosine phosphorylated C-terminal fragment (CTF). Although it was postulated that this fragment is formed as a result of shedding of the N-terminal ectodomain, collagen-dependent release of the DDR1 extracellular domain has not been demonstrated. We now report that, in conjunction with CTF formation, collagen type I stimulates concentration-dependent, saturable shedding of the DDR1 ectodomain from two carcinoma cell lines, and from transfected cells. In contrast, collagen did not promote cleavage of other transmembrane proteins including the amyloid precursor protein (APP), ErbB2, and E-cadherin. Collagen-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and proteolysis of DDR1 in carcinoma cells were reduced by a pharmacologic Src inhibitor. Moreover, expression of a dominant negative Src mutant protein in human embryonic kidney cells inhibited collagen-dependent phosphorylation and shedding of co-transfected DDR1. The hydroxamate-based metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI-1 (tumor necrosis factor-alpha protease inhibitor-1), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-3, also blocked collagen-evoked DDR1 shedding, but did not reduce levels of the phosphorylated CTF. Neither shedding nor CTF formation were affected by the gamma-secretase inhibitor, L-685,458. The results demonstrate that collagen-evoked ectodomain cleavage of DDR1 is mediated in part by Src-dependent activation or recruitment of a matrix- or disintegrin metalloproteinase, and that CTF formation can occur independently of ectodomain shedding. Delayed shedding of the DDR1 ectodomain may represent a mechanism that limits DDR1-dependent cell adhesion and migration on collagen matrices.']},\n",

Platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) plays a crucial role in collagen-induced activation and aggregation of platelets, and people who are deficient in GPVI suffer from bleeding disorders. Based on the fact that GPVI is coupled to the Fc receptor (FcR)-gamma chain and thus should share homology with the FcR chains, the genes encoding human and mouse GPVI were identified. They belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and share 64% homology at the protein level. Functional evidence demonstrating the identity of the recombinant protein with GPVI was shown by binding to its natural ligand collagen; binding to convulxin (Cvx), a GPVI-specific ligand from snake venom; binding of anti-GPVI IgG isolated from a patient; and association to the FcR-gamma chain. The study also demonstrated that the soluble protein blocks Cvx and collagen-induced platelet aggregation and that GPVI expression is restricted to megakaryocytes and platelets.

Collagen II was found to be a much better ligand for DDR2 than for DDR1. As expected, DDR2 binding to collagen II was dependent on triple-helical collagen and was mediated by the DDR2 discoidin domain. Collagen II served as a potent stimulator of DDR2 autophosphorylation, the first step in transmembrane signalling.

Osteoclastogenesis requires costimulatory receptor signaling through adaptors containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), such as Fc receptor common Î³ (FcRÎ³) and DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa. Identification of these ITAM-containing receptors and their ligands remains a high research priority, since the stimuli for osteoclastogenesis are only partly defined. Osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR) was proposed to be a potent FcRÎ³-associated costimulatory receptor expressed by preosteoclasts in vitro, but OSCAR lacks a cognate ligand and its role in vivo has been unclear. Using samples from mice and patients deficient in various ITAM signaling pathways, we show here that OSCAR costimulates one of the major FcRÎ³-associated pathways required for osteoclastogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, we found that OSCAR binds to specific motifs within fibrillar collagens in the ECM that become revealed on nonquiescent bone surfaces in which osteoclasts undergo maturation and terminal differentiation in vivo. OSCAR promoted osteoclastogenesis in vivo, and OSCAR binding to its collagen motif led to signaling that increased numbers of osteoclasts in culture. Thus, our results suggest that ITAM-containing receptors can respond to exposed ligands in collagen, leading to the functional differentiation of leukocytes, which provides what we believe to be a new concept for ITAM regulation of cytokine receptors in different tissue microenvironments.']},\n",

The recombinant alpha3NC1 domain contained a RGD site as part of a short collagenous sequence at the N terminus, designated herein as RGD-alpha3NC1.

In the present study, we used the alpha3NC1 domain with or without the RGD site, expressed in HEK 293 cells for native conformation, as an alternative approach to synthetic peptides to assess the functionality of the RGD site and non-RGD motifs. Our results demonstrate a predominant role of the RGD site for endothelial adhesion and for binding of alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(v)beta(5) integrins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the two non-RGD peptides, previously identified as the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-binding sites of the alpha3NC1 domain, are 10-fold less potent in competing for integrin binding than the native protein, indicating the importance of additional structural and/or conformational features of the alpha3NC1 domain for integrin binding. Therefore, the RGD site, in addition to non-RGD motifs, may contribute to the mechanisms of endothelial cell adhesion in the human vasculature and the anti-angiogenic activity of the RGD-alpha3NC1 domain.']},\n",

Mutations of SLC4A11, an abundant corneal solute transporter, cause CHED and some cases of FECD. The link between defective SLC4A11 solute transport function and CEnC loss is, however, unclear. Cell adhesion assays using SLC4A11-transfected HEK293 cells and primary human CEnC revealed that SLC4A11 promotes adhesion to components of Descemet's membrane (DM), the basement membrane layer to which CEnC bind. An antibody against SLC4A11 extracellular loop 3 (EL3) suppressed cell adhesion, identifying EL3 as the DM-binding site. Earlier studies showed that some SLC4A11 mutations cause FECD and CHED by impairing solute transport activity or cell surface trafficking. Without affecting these functions, FECD-causing mutations in SLC4A11-EL3 compromised cell adhesion capacity. In an energy-minimized SLC4A11-EL3 three-dimensional model, these mutations cluster and are buried within the EL3 structure. A GST fusion protein of SLC4A11-EL3 interacts with principal DM protein, COL8A2, as identified by mass spectrometry. Engineered SLC4A11-EL3-containing protein, STIC (SLC4A11-EL3 Transmembrane-GPA Integrated Chimera), promotes cell adhesion in transfected HEK293 cells and primary human CEnC, confirming the cell adhesion role of EL3. Taken together, the data suggest that SLC4A11 directly binds DM to serve as a cell adhesion molecule (CAM).

ColQ also functions in signaling, as it regulates acetylcholine receptor clustering and synaptic gene expression, in a manner dependent on muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), a key protein in NMJ formation and maintenance. MuSK forms a complex with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4), its coreceptor for the proteoglycan agrin at the NMJ. Previous studies suggested that ColQ also interacts with MuSK. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ColQ functions and ColQ-MuSK interaction have not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated whether ColQ binds directly to MuSK and/or LRP4 and whether it modulates agrin-mediated MuSK-LRP4 activation. Using coimmunoprecipitation, pull-down, plate-binding assays, and surface plasmon resonance, we show that ColQ binds directly to LRP4 but not to MuSK and that ColQ interacts indirectly with MuSK through LRP4. In addition, we show that the LRP4 N-terminal region, which contains the agrin-binding sites, is also crucial for ColQ binding to LRP4. Moreover, ColQ-LRP4 interaction was reduced in the presence of agrin, suggesting that agrin and ColQ compete for binding to LRP4. Strikingly, we reveal ColQ has two opposing effects on agrin-induced MuSK-LRP4 signaling: it constitutively reduces MuSK phosphorylation levels in agrin-stimulated myotubes but concomitantly increases MuSK accumulation at the muscle cell surface. Our results identify LRP4 as a major receptor of ColQ and provide new insights into mechanisms of ColQ signaling and acetylcholinesterase anchoring at the NMJ.']},\n",

Function-blocking antibodies to CD47 and alphaVbeta3 integrin reduced cell attachment to COMP, implicating the participation of these cell surface molecules in COMP cell binding. Immunofluorescence studies showed that cell attachment to COMP induced the formation of lamellae containing F-actin microspikes associated with fascin. We propose that COMP promotes cell attachment via two independent mechanisms involving cell surface CD47 and alphaVbeta3 integrin and that a consequence of cell attachment to COMP is the specific induction of fascin-stabilized actin microspikes.']},\n",

However, non-natural SRIH octapeptide agonists (mainly lanreotide and vapreotide) displace 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin from pituitary binding sites suggesting that an endogenous factor related to SRIH might exist and interact with GHS-R. Our aims were to investigate the ability of different SRIH-like peptides such as various SRIH fragments (SRIH 3-14, SRIH 7-14, SRIH 3-10, SRIH 7-10, SRIH 2-9) and a natural neuropeptide that shows a high structural homology with SRIH such as cortistatin-14 (CST) to compete with 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin for human pituitary binding sites and to compare their binding affinity with that of hexarelin and ghrelin, a gastric-derived peptidyl GHS that has been proposed as a natural ligand of GHS-R. While the binding of 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin to pituitary membranes was completely displaced by unlabelled hexarelin, ghrelin and CST, none of the SRIH fragments tested inhibited this binding. Ghrelin and CST exhibited a similar affinity (4.6-5.4 x 10(-7) mol/l) for the binding while hexarelin was more effective by about four orders of magnitude in displacing 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin. Our data demonstrate for the first time that cortistatin, a natural peptide related to SRIH, binds to GHS-R and suggest that this factor may play a role in modulating the activity of these receptors.']},\n",

CRF receptors were highly expressed and strongly coupled to Gs in HEK293 and SK-N-MC cells. However, when the calcium mobilization pathway was investigated, marked differences were observed. In SK-N-MC cells, neither CRF receptor stimulated calcium mobilization in the fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) assay, whereas activation of orexin type 1 and 2 receptors stably expressed in SK-N-MC cells revealed robust calcium responses. In contrast, intracellular calcium was strongly mobilized by agonist stimulation of hCRF1 and hCRF2(a) receptors in HEK293 cells. In HEK293 cells, potency rank orders for calcium and cAMP responses were identical for both receptors, despite a rightward shift of the dose-response curves. Complete inhibition of calcium signaling of both hCRF1 and hCRF2(a) receptors was observed in the presence of the PLC inhibitor U-73,122 whereas ryanodine, an inhibitor of calcium release channels and the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-cAMPS were ineffective. Finally, CRF agonists produced a small but significant stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) accumulation in hCRF1-and hCRF2(a)-transfected HEK293 cells.

The receptor expressed in COS cells binds rat/human CRF with high affinity (Kd = 3.3 +/- 0.45 nM) and specificity and is functionally coupled to adenylate cyclase.

CRFR1 shares 70% sequence identity with CRFR2, yet has much higher affinity for rat/human CRF (r/hCRF) than CRFR2. As a first step toward understanding the interactions between rat/human CRF and its receptor, the regions that are involved in receptor-ligand binding and/or receptor activation were determined by using chimeric receptor constructs of the two human CRFR subtypes, CRFR1 and CRFR2, followed by generating point mutations of the receptor. The EC50 values in stimulation of intracellular cAMP of the chimeric and mutant receptors for the peptide ligand were determined using a cAMP-dependent reporter system. Three regions of the receptor were found to be important for optimal binding of r/hCRF and/or receptor activation. The first region was mapped to the junction of the third extracellular domain and the fifth transmembrane domain; substitution of three amino acids of CRFR1 in this region (Val266, Tyr267, and Thr268) by the corresponding CRFR2 amino acids (Asp266, Leu267, and Val268) increased the EC50 value by approximately 10-fold. The other two regions were localized to the second extracellular domain of the CRFR1 involving amino acids 175-178 and His189 residue. Substitutions in these two regions each increased the EC50 value for r/hCRF by approximately 7- to 8-fold only in the presence of the amino acid 266-268 mutation involving the first region, suggesting that their roles in peptide ligand binding might be secondary.',\n",

The hCRF(2alpha) and xCRF(2) receptors bound all four radioligands with different affinities, whereas hCRF(1) did not bind (125)I-aSVG, and xCRF(1) bound neither (125)I-sauvagine nor (125)I-aSVG. Competitive binding studies using unlabeled agonists and antagonists with hCRF(1) and hCRF(2alpha) receptors revealed that most agonists exhibited higher affinity in displacing agonist radioligands compared with displacement of antagonist radioligands. Exceptions were the agonists human and rat urocortin, which displayed high-affinity binding in the presence of either (125)I-labeled agonist or antagonist ligands. In contrast, the affinities of antagonists were independent of the nature of the radioligand. We also found that, in contrast to the mammalian CRF receptors, the affinity of ligand binding to xCRF(1) and xCRF(2) receptors strongly depended on the nature of the radioligand used for competition. For xCRF(1), competitors showed different rank order binding profiles with (125)I-CRF compared with (125)I-AST as the displaceable ligand. Similarly, binding of competitors to the xCRF(2) receptor showed markedly different profiles with (125)I-CRF as the competed ligand compared with the other radioligands.

To test this hypothesis, binding and signaling properties were determined for both receptor subtypes stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) and human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells. CRF receptors were highly expressed and strongly coupled to Gs in HEK293 and SK-N-MC cells. However, when the calcium mobilization pathway was investigated, marked differences were observed. In SK-N-MC cells, neither CRF receptor stimulated calcium mobilization in the fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) assay, whereas activation of orexin type 1 and 2 receptors stably expressed in SK-N-MC cells revealed robust calcium responses. In contrast, intracellular calcium was strongly mobilized by agonist stimulation of hCRF1 and hCRF2(a) receptors in HEK293 cells. In HEK293 cells, potency rank orders for calcium and cAMP responses were identical for both receptors, despite a rightward shift of the dose-response curves. Complete inhibition of calcium signaling of both hCRF1 and hCRF2(a) receptors was observed in the presence of the PLC inhibitor U-73,122 whereas ryanodine, an inhibitor of calcium release channels and the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-cAMPS were ineffective. Finally, CRF agonists produced a small but significant stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) accumulation in hCRF1-and hCRF2(a)-transfected HEK293 cells. These data clearly show that phospholipase C-mediated signaling of CRF receptors is dependent upon the cellular background and that in HEK293 cells human CRF receptors robustly respond in the FLIPR format.',\n",

In this article, we report the genomic structure and the corresponding complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence of the human CRF2 receptor. The gene coding for human CRF2 receptor consists of at least 12 exons and spans approximately 30 kilobases. The cDNA sequence in the protein-coding region is 94% identical to that of the reported rat CRF2 alpha receptor. At present, there is no evidence for the existence of a CRF2 beta receptor homolog in humans. The encoded receptor is 411 amino acids in length and is 70% identical to the human CRF1 receptor, with least sequence homology in the N-terminal extracellular domain (47% identical). Cells transfected with the full-length human CRF2 receptor cDNA responded to rat/human CRF and sauvagine by increasing the intracellular cAMP level, with EC50 values of approximately 20 and 1 nM, respectively. The CRF- and sauvagine-induced accumulation of intracellular cAMP could be competitively inhibited by the CRF receptor antagonist D-Phe-CRF.

Recently, EGF-CFC proteins were implicated as essential signaling cofactors for Nodal, a transforming growth factor beta family member whose expression has previously been defined as embryo specific. To identify a receptor for CR-1, a human brain cDNA phage display library was screened using CR-1 protein as bait. Phage inserts with identity to ALK4, a type I serine/threonine kinase receptor for Activin, were identified. CR-1 binds to cell surface ALK4 expressed on mammalian epithelial cells in fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, as well as by coimmunoprecipitation. Nodal is coexpressed with mouse Cr-1 in the mammary gland, and CR-1 can phosphorylate the transcription factor Smad-2 in EpH-4 mammary epithelial cells only in the presence of Nodal and ALK4. In contrast, CR-1 stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT in these cells is independent of Nodal and ALK4, suggesting that CR-1 may modulate different signaling pathways to mediate its different functional roles.',\n",

Members of the EGF-CFC family play key roles in embryonic development and are also implicated in tumourigenesis. Cripto is highly over-expressed in many tumours, while it is poorly detectable in normal tissues. Although both Cripto domains are involved in its tumourigenic activity, the CFC domain appears to play a crucial role. Indeed, through this domain, Cripto interferes with the onco-suppressive activity of Activins, either by blocking the Activin receptor ALK4 or by antagonising proteins of the TGF-beta family. We have undertaken the chemical synthesis and the structural characterisation of human CFC Cripto domain. Using a combined NMR and computational approach, supported by binding studies by SPR, we have investigated the molecular basis of the interaction between h-CFC and ALK4. Binding studies indicate that the synthetic h-CFC interacts with the ALK4 receptor with a K(D) in micro M range, whereas it does not recognise the ActRIIB receptor. The NMR study shows that the h-CFC overall topology is determined by the presence of three disulfide bridges and that residues H120 and W124 are located between the first strand and the first loop with the side chains externally exposed. A model of the CFC-ALK4 complex has also been obtained by molecular docking and shows that all residues indicated by prior mutagenesis studies can contribute to the ALK4-CFC interaction at the protein-protein interface.']},\n",

Cripto has important roles during development and oncogenesis and binds nodal or related ligands and ALK4 to facilitate assembly of type I and type II receptor signaling complexes. Because Cripto mediates signaling via activin receptors and binds directly to ALK4, we tested whether transfection with Cripto would affect the ability of activin to signal and/or interact with its receptors. Here we show that Cripto can form a complex with activin and ActRII/IIB. We were unable to detect activin binding to Cripto in the absence of ActRII/IIB, indicating that unlike nodal, activin requires type II receptors to bind Cripto. If cotransfected with ActRII/IIB and ALK4, Cripto inhibited crosslinking of activin to ALK4 and the association of ALK4 with ActRII/IIB. In addition, Cripto blocked activin signaling when transfected into either HepG2 cells or 293T cells. We have also shown that under conditions in which Cripto facilitates nodal signaling, it antagonizes activin. Inhibition of activin signaling provides an additional example of a Cripto effect on the regulation of signaling by transforming growth factor-beta superfamily members.

The binding partner was identified by mass spectrometry as alpha(1)B-glycoprotein (A1BG), which is a known plasma protein of unknown function and a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily.

It stimulates myeloid and erythroid progenitors to form colonies in semisolid medium in vitro, as well as enhancing multiple differentiated functions of mature neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils. We have examined the binding of human GM-CSF to a variety of responsive human cells and cell lines. The most mature myelomonocytic cells, specifically human neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils, express the highest numbers of a single class of high affinity receptors (Kd approximately 37 pM, 293-1000 sites/cell). HL-60 and KG-1 cells exhibit an increase in specific binding at high concentrations of GM-CSF; computer analysis of the data is nonetheless consistent with a single class of high affinity binding sites with a Kd approximately 43 pM and 20-450 sites/cell. Dimethyl sulfoxide induces a 3-10-fold increase in high affinity receptors expressed in HL-60 cells, coincident with terminal neutrophilic differentiation. Finally, binding of 125I-GM-CSF to fresh peripheral blood cells from six patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia was analyzed. In three of six cases, binding was similar to the nonsaturable binding observed with HL-60 and KG-1 cells. GM-CSF binding was low, or in some cases, undetectable on myeloblasts obtained from eight patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. The observed affinities of the receptor for GM-CSF are consistent with all known biological activities. Affinity labeling of both normal neutrophils and dimethyl sulfoxide-induced HL-60 cells with unglycosylated 125I-GM-CSF yielded a band of 98 kDa, implying a molecular weight of approximately 84,000 for the human GM-CSF receptor.',\n",
       "   'The receptor for the hemopoietic growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is composed of two chains, both of which belong to the superfamily of cytokine receptors. The alpha chain confers low affinity binding only, whereas the beta chain (betac) confers high affinity binding when associated with alpha. Ectopic expression of both chains of the receptor in murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts results in signal transduction, mitogenesis, and morphologic transformation. The cytoplasmic domain of the GM-CSF receptor alpha subunit (GMR-alpha) comprises 54 amino acids that have been shown to be important for signal transduction through the beta chain. The present study was designed to address the possibility of receptor oligomerization and its functional implication. Cross-linking studies with 125I-GM-CSF on NIH-3T3 transfectants is consistent with the presence of alpha and betac dimers and of receptor oligomers. We have, therefore, generated an inert alpha chain through polymerase chain reaction-mediated truncation of 47 amino acids of the COOH-terminal domain of alpha (alphat), and coexpressed alphat, alpha, and betac in NIH-3T3. In cells in which alphat and alpha are present in stoichiometric proportion within the GM-CSF-binding complex, we provide evidence that alphat is dominant negative over wild type alpha on the basis of two different functional assays: cell proliferation and foci formation. Hence, our results suggest the requirement for at least two functional alpha chains for signal transduction. Together with the cross-linking studies, our data indicate that the functional GMR is an oligomer that contains at least two alpha chains.',\n",

The biologic actions of GM-CSF are mediated by binding to a specific receptor consisting of two chains designated as alpha and beta subunits. We have demonstrated that the murine FDC-P1-derived cell line WT-19 transfected with the human GM-CSF receptor alpha and beta subunits (GM-CSFRalpha and beta) can be induced to differentiate by the addition of human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF). By expressing a series of GM-CSFRalpha mutants in WT19 cells, we have determined the amino acid domains of the GM-CSFRalpha cytoplasmic domain that regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. We found that the membrane proximal proline-rich domain and adjacent 16 residues are essential for both hGM-CSF-dependent cell proliferation and differentiation. In contrast, the C-terminal region of the GM-CSFRalpha cytoplasmic domain was not necessary for cell differentiation mediated by hGM-CSF, but the removal of this region severely impaired the ability of hGM-CSF to support cell survival. While the activation of JAK2, Shc, Erk, and STAT5 proteins correlated with hGM-CSF-mediated cell growth, cellular differentiation occurred in the absence of activation of these signal transduction pathways.']},\n",

The GM-CSF receptor consists of two subunits: GMRalpha, which binds GM-CSF with low affinity, and GMRbeta, which lacks intrinsic ligand-binding capability but complexes with GMRalpha to form a high-affinity receptor (GMRalpha/beta). We conducted dynamic kinetic analyses of GM-CSF receptors to define the role of GMRbeta in the interaction of ligand and receptor. Our data show that GMRalpha/beta exhibits a higher k(on) than GMRalpha, indicating that GMRbeta facilitates ligand acquisition to the binding pocket. Heterogeneity with regard to GM-CSF dissociation from GMRalpha/beta points to the presence of loose and tight ligand-receptor complexes in high-affinity binding. Although the loose complex has a k(off) similar to GMRalpha, the lower k(off) indicates that GMRbeta inhibits GM-CSF release from the tight receptor complex. The two rates of ligand dissociation may provide for discrete mechanisms of interaction between GM-CSF and its high-affinity receptor. These results show that the beta subunit functions to stabilize ligand binding as well as to facilitate ligand acquisition.',\n",
       "   'The beta subunit (beta c) of the receptors for human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) is essential for high affinity ligand-binding and signal transduction. An important feature of this subunit is its common nature, being able to interact with GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5. Analogous common subunits have also been identified in other receptor systems including gp130 and the IL-2 receptor gamma subunit. It is not clear how common receptor subunits bind multiple ligands. We have used site-directed mutagenesis and binding assays with radiolabelled GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 to identify residues in the beta c subunit involved in affinity conversion for each ligand. Alanine substitutions in the region Tyr365-Ile368 in beta c showed that Tyr365, His367 and Ile368 were required for GM-CSF and IL-5 high affinity binding, whereas Glu366 was unimportant. In contrast, alanine substitutions of these residues only marginally reduced the conversion of IL-3 binding to high affinity by beta c. To identify likely contact points in GM-CSF involved in binding to the 365-368 beta c region we used the GM-CSF mutant eco E21R which is unable to interact with wild-type beta c whilst retaining full GM-CSF receptor alpha chain binding. Eco E21R exhibited greater binding affinity to receptor alpha beta complexes composed of mutant beta chains Y365A, H367A and I368A than to those composed of wild-type beta c or mutant E366A. These results (i) identify the residues Tyr365, His367 and Ile368 as critical for affinity conversion by beta c, (ii) show that high affinity binding of GM-CSF and IL-5 can be dissociated from IL-3 and (iii) suggest that Tyr365, His367 and Ile368 in beta c interact with Glu21 of GM-CSF.',\n",
       "   'High-affinity receptors for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 3, and interleukin 5 consist of ligand-specific alpha chains (low-affinity subunits) and a common beta chain (beta c) that converts each complex to a high-affinity form. Although beta c alone has no detectable cytokine-binding activity, amino acid substitutions for Glu-21 of human GM-CSF significantly reduce high-affinity but not low-affinity binding, implying that beta c interacts directly with GM-CSF during formation of the high-affinity receptor but only in the presence of the alpha chain. A potential GM-CSF-binding determinant was identified in the second hemopoietin domain of beta c, and the role of individual residues within this region was investigated by determining the ability of mutated beta c chains to confer high-affinity binding when coexpressed with the alpha subunit of the GM-CSF receptor in COS cells. Substitutions involving Met-363, Arg-364, Tyr-365, and Glu-366 did not affect high-affinity binding. However, substitution of His-367 by lysine or glutamine abolished high-affinity binding, suggesting that this residue may form an important part of the high-affinity GM-CSF-binding determinant. Consistent with the loss of high-affinity binding, higher concentrations of human GM-CSF were required to stimulate proliferation of CTLL-2 cell lines transfected with cDNAs for GM-CSF receptor alpha chain and His-367 beta c mutant than those expressing GM-CSF receptor alpha subunit and beta c wild type.']},\n",

Antisense oligonucleotides that reduced specifically the expression of syndecan-2 inhibited the mitogenic activity of GM-CSF and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 induced by the cytokine.

G-CSF was infused at bolus doses of 1 microg/kg and 5 microg/kg, and compared to placebo and dexamethasone (1 mg/kg b.i.d), which enhances the plasma levels of endogenous G-CSF. The study was randomized, double-blind, four-way crossover, in eight healthy male volunteers.

The G-CSF/CD114 interaction dose-independently induced degranulation of neutrophils as evidenced by a 300-400% increase in CD11b expression. Degranulation induced up to a 10-fold increase in plasma levels of gelatinase B, an enzyme known to precipitate neutropenia and subsequent neutrophilia in animals.

       "   'We identified two novel isoforms of the human chemokine receptor CX3CR1, produced by alternative splicing and with N-terminal regions extended by 7 and 32 aa. Expression of the messengers coding these isoforms, compared with that of previously described V28 messengers, is lower in monocytes and NK cells, but higher in CD4(+) T lymphocytes. CX3CR1 and its extended isoforms were expressed in HEK-293 cells and compared for expression, ligand binding, and cellular responses. In steady state experiments, all three CX3CR1 isoforms bound CX3CL1 with similar affinity. In kinetic binding studies, however, k(on) and k(off) were significantly greater for the extended CX3CR1 isoforms, thereby suggesting that the N-terminal extensions may alter the functions induced by CX3CL1. In signaling studies, all three CX3CR1 isoforms mediated agonist-dependent calcium mobilization, but the EC(50) was lower for the extended than for the standard isoforms. In addition, chemotactic responses for these extended isoforms shifted left, also indicating a more sensitive response. Finally, the longer variants appeared to be more potent HIV coreceptors when tested in fusion and infection assays. In conclusion, we identified and characterized functionally two novel isoforms of CX3CR1 that respond more sensitively to CX3CL1 and HIV viral envelopes. These data reveal new complexity in CX3CR1 cell activation and confirm the critical role of the N-terminal domain of the chemokine receptors in ligand recognition and cellular response.',\n",
       "   'The membrane-bound chemokine fractalkine (FKN, CX3CL1) on endothelial cells plays a role in leukocyte trafficking. The chemokine domain (FKN-CD) is sufficient for inducing FKN signaling (e.g., integrin activation), and FKN-CD binds to its receptor CX3CR1 on leukocytes. Whereas previous studies suggest that FKN-CD does not directly bind to integrins, our docking simulation studies predicted that FKN-CD directly interacts with integrin Î±(v)Î²(3). Consistent with this prediction, we demonstrated that FKN-CD directly bound to Î±(v)Î²(3) and Î±(4)Î²(1) at a very high affinity (K(D) of 3.0 Ã— 10(-10) M to Î±(v)Î²(3) in 1 mM Mn(2+)).

The binding site for FKN-CD in Î±(v)Î²(3) was similar to those for other known Î±(v)Î²(3) ligands. Wild-type FKN-CD induced coprecipitation of integrins and CX3CR1 in U937 cells, suggesting that FKN-CD induces ternary complex formation (CX3CR1, FKN-CD, and integrin). Based on the docking model, we generated an integrin-binding defective FKN-CD mutant (the K36E/R37E mutant). K36E/R37E was defective in ternary complex formation and integrin activation, whereas K36E/R37E still bound to CX3CR1. These results suggest that FKN-CD binding to CX3CR1 is not sufficient for FKN signaling, and that FKN-CD binding to integrins as coreceptors and the resulting ternary complex formation are required for FKN signaling. Notably, excess K36E/R37E suppressed integrin activation induced by wild-type FKN-CD and effectively suppressed leukocyte infiltration in thioglycollate-induced peritonitis.

       "   'Leukocyte trafficking at the endothelium requires both cellular adhesion molecules and chemotactic factors. Fractalkine, a novel transmembrane molecule with a CX3C-motif chemokine domain atop a mucin stalk, induces both adhesion and migration of leukocytes. Here we identify a seven-transmembrane high-affinity receptor for fractalkine and show that it mediates both the adhesive and migratory functions of fractalkine. The receptor, now termed CX3CR1, requires pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein signaling to induce migration but not to support adhesion, which also occurs without other adhesion molecules but requires the architecture of a chemokine domain atop the mucin stalk. Natural killer cells predominantly express CX3CR1 and respond to fractalkine in both migration and adhesion. Thus, fractalkine and CX3CR1 represent new types of leukocyte trafficking regulators, performing both adhesive and chemotactic functions.',\n",
       "   \"Fractalkine, a novel CX3C chemokine, is unusual because of both its membrane-associated structure and its direct role in cell adhesion. We have solved the solution structure of the chemokine domain of fractalkine (residues 1-76) by heteronuclear NMR methods. The 20 lowest energy structures in the ensemble have an average backbone rmsd of 0.43 A, excluding the termini. In contrast to many other chemokines which form homodimers, fractalkine's chemokine module is monomeric. Comparison of the structure to CC and CXC chemokines reveals interesting differences which are likely to be relevant to receptor binding. These include a bulge formed by the CX3C motif, the relative orientation of the N-terminus and 30's loop (residues 30-38), and the conformation of the N-loop (residues 9-19). 15N backbone relaxation experiments indicate that these same regions of the protein are dynamic. We also titrated 15N-labeled protein with a peptide from the N-terminus of the receptor CX3CR1 and confirmed that this region of the receptor contacts the fractalkine chemokine domain. Interestingly, the binding site maps roughly to the regions of greatest flexibility and structural variability. Together, these data provide a first glimpse of how fractalkine interacts with its receptor and should help guide mutagenesis studies to further elucidate the molecular details of binding and signaling through CX3CR1.\"]},\n",

These in vitro observations are supported by the finding that IL-8/CXCL8-driven neutrophil recruitment into the lungs was markedly attenuated in transgenic mice lacking the Duffy Ag.

       "   'Chemokines displayed on the luminal surface of blood vessels play pivotal roles in inflammatory and homeostatic leukocyte trafficking in vivo. However, the mechanisms underlying the functional regulation of chemokines on the endothelial cell surface remain ill-defined. A promiscuous chemokine receptor, the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), has been implicated in the regulation of chemokine functions. Here we show that DARC is selectively expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in the high endothelial venules (HEV) of unstimulated lymph nodes (LN). To examine the biological significance of DARC expression in HEV, we performed competitive binding experiments with 20 different chemokines. The results showed that DARC selectively bound distinct members of the pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL2, CCL5 and CCL7, but not lymphoid chemokines such as CCL21, CCL19, CXCL12 and CXCL13 that are normally expressed in HEV. CCL2 bound to DARC failed to induce a significant cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation in CCR2B-expressing cells, whereas the free form of CCL2 induced a distinct [Ca(2+)] elevation, suggesting that DARC down-regulates activities of pro-inflammatory chemokines upon binding. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding DARC did not induce any obvious changes in the cell number or leukocyte subsets in the peripheral and mesenteric LN. Neither did DARC deficiency significantly affect lymphocyte migration into LN. These results suggest that DARC may be a scavenger for pro-inflammatory chemokines, but not a presenting molecule for lymphoid chemokines at HEV and that it is probably functionally dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking to HEV-bearing lymphoid tissues under physiological conditions.',\n",

A Ca2+ response is found for IL-8R-A following the binding of IL-8; no response is found for MGSA. A Ca2+ response for IL-8R-B follows the binding of both ligands.

Here we show for the first time that NAP-2 and MGSA induce two distinct optima of neutrophil chemotaxis. A first optimum is elicited within a concentration range as low as it is characteristic for IL-8. However, a second optimum appears at more than 200-fold higher stimulus concentrations, at which IL-8 is inactive. Investigating the involvement of the two chemokine receptors CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 in NAP-2-mediated chemotaxis, we observe that the cells become desensitized to the first optimum of the chemokine after selective downregulation of CXCR-2, while both optima disappear upon simultaneous downregulation of both receptors. Blocking monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) specific for CXCR-2 or CXCR-1 either suppress the first optimum of NAP-2-induced chemotaxis or drastically reduce the second one, respectively. These results provide evidence that both receptors are involved in NAP-2-induced neutrophil chemotaxis, with CXCR-2 rendering the cells responsive to low dosages of the chemokine, and with CXCR-1 extending their responsiveness to NAP-2 dosages higher by several orders of magnitude.']},\n",

Radioligand binding assays confirmed that the binding profiles of the recombinant receptors were similar to those of the native proteins. IL-8 displaced [125I]-IL-8 binding to CXCR1 and CXCR2 with pKi values of 8.89+/-0.05 and 9.27+/-0.03, respectively. GROalpha, a selective CXCR2 ligand, had a pKi value of 9.66+/-0.39 at CXCR2 but a pKi>8 at CXCR1. Calcium mobilization experiments were also consistent with previous reports on native receptors. Activation of both receptors resulted in stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. A comparison of the functional data at CXCRI showed that a similar potency order (IL-8> >GROalpha) was obtained in all three assays. However, at CXCR2 whilst the potency orders for calcium mobilization and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase were similar (IL-8 > or = GROalpha), the order was reversed for stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding (GROalpha > IL-8). All of the functional responses at both receptors were inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX), suggesting coupling to a Gi/Go protein. However, the calcium mobilization induced by IL-8 at CXCR1 was not fully inhibited by PTX, suggesting an interaction with a G-protein of the Gq family. Our results with pertussis toxin also suggested that, in the [35S]GTPgammaS binding assay, CXCR1 displays some constitutive activity. Thus, we have characterized the binding and several functional responses at HA-tagged CXCRs 1 and 2 and have shown that their pharmacology agrees well with that of the native receptors.

Recently, cDNA clones encoding a high affinity IL-8 receptor (IL-8R-A) and a \"low affinity\" IL-8 receptor (IL-8R-B) have been isolated from human cDNA libraries. These two receptors have 77% amino acid identity and are members of the G protein-coupled superfamily of receptors with seven transmembrane domains. We have expressed these two receptors in mammalian cells and find that in this system both receptors bind IL-8 with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The receptor affinities differ for MGSA, however. IL-8R-A binds MGSA with low affinity (Kd approximately 450 nM); IL-8R-B binds MGSA with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The transfected cells respond to ligand binding with a transient increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. A Ca2+ response is found for IL-8R-A following the binding of IL-8; no response is found for MGSA. A Ca2+ response for IL-8R-B follows the binding of both ligands. Blot hybridization with oligonucleotide probes specific for the two receptors shows that mRNA for both receptors is present in human neutrophils. Analysis of IL-8 and MGSA binding data on neutrophils as well as Ca2+ response and desensitization data shows that the presence of these two IL-8 receptors on the cell surface can account for the profile of these two ligands on neutrophils.',\n",
       "   'Human interleukin-8 receptors A (IL-8RA) and B (IL-8RB) are seven-transmembrane domain (TMD) neutrophil chemokine receptors with similar sequences (77% amino acid identity) and similar G protein selectivity, but markedly different selectivity for CXC chemokines. IL-8RB is selective for IL-8, growth-related oncogene alpha (GRO alpha) and neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2), whereas IL-8RA is selective only for IL-8. To identify selectivity determinants, we made eight chimeric receptors exchanging: 1) the three main regions of sequence divergence between IL-8RA and IL-8RB (the N-terminal segment before TMD1, the region from TMD4 to the end of the second extracellular (e2) loop, and the C-terminal tail), and 2) the N-terminal segment of CC chemokine receptor 1, which does not bind CXC chemokines. Chimeras were tested by direct 125I-IL-8, 125I-GRO alpha, and 125I-NAP-2 binding, heterologous competition binding, and calcium flux assays using human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with receptor DNAs. The following results were obtained: 1) chimeric receptors had binding sites for IL-8, GRO alpha and NAP-2 distinct from those on IL-8RA and IL-8RB; 2) IL-8, GRO alpha and NAP-2 bound to overlapping but distinct sites that mapped differentially to multiple domains on IL-8RB; 3) high affinity radioligand binding and high agonist potency were separable functions for IL-8, GRO alpha and NAP-2, suggesting that the determinants of high affinity binding may not be critical for receptor activation; and 4) determinants of GRO alpha and NAP-2 selectivity were found in both the N-terminal segment before TMD1 and the region from TMD4 to the end of the e2 loop of IL-8RB, and functioned independently of each other. Stated reciprocally, the N-terminal segment of IL-8RA was not a dominant selectivity determinant. These data suggest that both narrow and broad spectrum chemokine antagonists can be developed to block functions mediated by IL-8RB.',\n",

Two human chemotactic receptor subtypes for IL-8, named IL-8 receptors (IL8R) A and B, have been cloned. They are 78% identical in amino acid sequence, coexpressed in neutrophils, and distinguished by their different selectivities for GROalpha and NAP-2. Their selectivity for other ELR+ CXC chemokines has not been previously reported. By measuring calcium flux in human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with plasmids encoding IL8RA or IL8RB, we have now defined receptor selectivity for GRObeta, GROgamma, and ENA-78. The rank order of agonist potency, based on inspection of the mean effective concentration values (EC50), for IL8RB was GROgamma (1 nM) > IL-8 (4 nM) approximately GROalpha (5 nM) approximately GRObeta (4 nM) approximately NAP-2 (7 nM) > ENA-78 (11 nM), and for IL8RA was IL-8 (4 nM) >>> ENA-78 (40 nM) approximately NAP-2 (45 nM) > GROalpha (63 nM) approximately GROgamma (65 nM) >> GRObeta. The maximal response of IL8RA to IL-8 was at least 2-fold greater than the other five chemokines. All six agonists for IL8RB competed for high affinity 125I-IL-8, -GROalpha, -NAP-2, and -ENA-78 binding sites at IL8RB. GROalpha, GRObeta, GROgamma, NAP-2, and ENA-78 competed weakly for the high affinity IL-8 binding site at IL8RA. Thus, IL8RA and IL8RB are both highly selective for IL-8 and have similar sequences but differ dramatically in their selectivity for all other ELR+ CXC chemokines tested. These findings have important implications for developing novel neutrophil-specific anti-inflammatory drugs directed against the CXC chemokine signaling system.',\n",
       "   'The mechanisms by which chemokines bind and signal through their receptors are complex and poorly understood. In the present study, we sought to dissect these processes and to map important functional domains of the two CXC chemokine (interleukin-8) receptors, CXCR1 (formally IL-8RA) and CXCR2 (formally IL-8RB), using blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the receptors and a series of chimeras between CXCR1 and CXCR2. A panel of specific mAbs against CXCR1 or CXCR2, generated by immunizing mice with transfectants expressing either receptor, were shown to effectively block IL-8- and/or growth-related oncogene alpha (GROalpha) -mediated ligand binding, chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding in CXCR1 and CXCR2 transfectants and/or human neutrophils. Of particular interest was an anti-CXCR1 mAb, 7D9, that inhibited chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding but had no detectable effects on ligand binding. The epitopes of these blocking mAbs were mapped by using a series of CXCR1/2 chimera transfectants and synthetic peptides. Most of the anti-CXCR1 antibodies, except 7D9, mapped to the amino acid sequence WDFDDL (CXCR1 residues 10-15), and all the anti-CXCR2 antibodies mapped to the amino acid sequence FEDFW (CXCR2 residues 6-10). The epitope of mAb 7D9 mainly involved a region within the first 45 residues of CXCR1, and it appeared to be conformation-sensitive. These results support a model in which the binding and signaling of IL-8 with its receptor occur in at least two discrete steps involving distinct domains of the receptor. This model is consistent with the notion that discrete conformational changes of the receptor secondary to ligand binding are required to trigger various biological responses. Moreover, the ligand binding and chemotaxis properties of each CXCR1/2 chimeric receptor to IL-8 and GROalpha were determined. It was found that each is distinct in its ability to confer ligand binding and chemotactic response to IL-8 and GROalpha, and two conclusions could be made. 1) The N-terminal segment of CXCR1 is a dominant determinant of receptor subtype selectivity, consistent with previous studies using rabbit/human CXCR1/2 chimeras; and 2) the specificity determinant for GROalpha binding in CXCR2 involves sequences in the N terminus, distal to the first 15 residues, as well as other parts of the receptor.']},\n",

In this study, by using highly sensitive Î²-arrestin recruitment assays based on NanoBiT and NanoBRET technologies, we identified the inflammatory CXC chemokine CXCL10 as a new strong agonist ligand for ACKR2. CXCL10 is known to play an important role in the infiltration of immune cells into the tumour bed and was previously reported to bind to CXCR3 only. We demonstrated that ACKR2 is able to internalize and reduce the availability of CXCL10 in the extracellular space. Moreover, we found that, in contrast to CC chemokines, CXCL10 activity towards ACKR2 was drastically reduced by the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) N-terminal processing, pointing to a different receptor binding pocket occupancy by CC and CXC chemokines. Overall, our study sheds new light on the complexity of the chemokine network and the potential role of CXCL10 regulation by ACKR2 in many physiological and pathological processes, including tumour immunology.

While studying responses that are mediated by these two receptors, we found that the agonists for CXCR3 act as antagonists for CCR3.

The CXC chemokines IP-10 and Mig are selective attractants for activated (memory) T cells, the predominant cell type in skin infiltrates in many inflammatory dermatoses. The selectivity for activated T cells can be explained by the fact that both chemokines exert their effects through a common receptor, CXCR3, which is nearly exclusively expressed on activated T cells. The aim of this study was to identify biologically active CXCR3 ligands produced by keratinocytes. To that end, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a cDNA encoding CXCR3 were challenged with proteins obtained from interferon-gamma stimulated keratinocytes and subsequently monitored for effects on second messenger systems. By this approach we were able to isolate IP-10 and Mig, and in addition identified a novel highly potent ligand for the CXCR3 receptor, designated interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9, which proved to be chemotactic for activated T cells expressing CXCR3. Protein sequence and mass spectrometric analysis followed by molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9, revealed that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 is a CXC chemokine with a molecular mass of 8303 Da. From a GenBank database query it became clear that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 is in fact the protein encoded by the cDNA sequence also known as beta-R1, H174 or I-TAC. In situ hybridization experiments showed that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 mRNA is expressed by basal layer keratinocytes in a variety of skin disorders, including allergic contact dermatitis, lichen planus, and mycosis fungoides suggesting a functional role for this chemokine in skin immune responses.',\n",

IP-10 also binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), an interaction thought to be important for its sequestration on endothelial and other cells. In this study, we performed an extensive mutational analysis to identify the CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of murine IP-10. The mutants were characterized for heparin binding, CXCR3 binding, and the ability to induce chemotaxis, Ca(2+) flux, and CXCR3 internalization. Double mutations neutralizing adjacent basic residues at the C terminus did not lead to a significant reduction in heparin binding, indicating that the main heparin binding site of IP-10 is not along the C-terminal alpha helix. Alanine exchange of Arg-22 had the largest effect on heparin binding, with residues Arg-20, Ile-24, Lys-26, Lys-46, and Lys-47 further contributing to heparin binding. A charge change mutation of Arg-22 resulted in further reduction in heparin binding. The N-terminal residue Arg-8, preceding the first cysteine, was critical for CXCR3 signaling. Mutations of charged and uncharged residues in the loop regions of residues 20-24 and 46-47, which caused reduced heparin binding, also resulted in reduced CXCR3 binding and signaling. CXCR3 expressing GAG-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed that GAG binding was not required for IP-10 binding and signaling through CXCR3, which suggests that the CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of IP-10 are partially overlapping.',\n",

There was a striking difference in potencies among the three CXCR3 ligands, with CXCL11 >> CXCL10 > CXCL9. A comparison of the rank order of K(i) values with the rank order of monocyte production levels of these three ligands revealed a precise inverse correlation, suggesting that the weaker receptor affinities of CXCL9 and CXCL10 were physiologically compensated for by an elevated expression, perhaps to maintain effectiveness of each ligand under physiological conditions.\",\n",

The receptor has very modest affinity for SDF-1alpha and little or no affinity for other CXC-chemokines. The properties of the endogenous receptor expressed on activated T-cells are similar. Surprisingly, several CC-chemokines, particularly eotaxin and MCP-4, also compete with moderate affinity for the binding of IP10 to CXCR3. Eotaxin does not activate CXCR3 but, in CXCR3-transfected cells, can block IP10-mediated receptor activation. Eotaxin, therefore, may be a natural CXCR3 antagonist.']},\n",

NBI-74330 demonstrated potent inhibition of [(125)I]CXCL10 and [(125)I]CXCL11 specific binding (K(i) of 1.5 and 3.2 nM, respectively) and of functional responses mediated by CXCR3, such as ligand-induced guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding, calcium mobilization, and cellular chemotaxis (IC(50) of 7 to 18 nM). NBI-74330 was selective for CXCR3 because it showed no significant inhibition of chemotactic responses to other chemokines and did not inhibit radioligand binding to a panel of nonchemokine G-protein coupled receptors. There was a striking difference in potencies among the three CXCR3 ligands, with CXCL11 >> CXCL10 > CXCL9. A comparison of the rank order of K(i) values with the rank order of monocyte production levels of these three ligands revealed a precise inverse correlation, suggesting that the weaker receptor affinities of CXCL9 and CXCL10 were physiologically compensated for by an elevated expression, perhaps to maintain effectiveness of each ligand under physiological conditions.\",\n",
       "   'Chemokines are essential mediators of normal leukocyte trafficking as well as of leukocyte recruitment during inflammation. We describe here a novel non-ELR CXC chemokine identified through sequence analysis of cDNAs derived from cytokine-activated primary human astrocytes. This novel chemokine, referred to as I-TAC (interferon-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant), is regulated by interferon (IFN) and has potent chemoattractant activity for interleukin (IL)-2-activated T cells, but not for freshly isolated unstimulated T cells, neutrophils, or monocytes. I-TAC interacts selectively with CXCR3, which is the receptor for two other IFN-inducible chemokines, the IFN-gamma-inducible 10-kD protein (IP-10) and IFN-gamma- induced human monokine (HuMig), but with a significantly higher affinity. In addition, higher potency and efficacy of I-TAC over IP-10 and HuMig is demonstrated by transient mobilization of intracellular calcium as well as chemotactic migration in both activated T cells and transfected cell lines expressing CXCR3. Stimulation of astrocytes with IFN-gamma and IL-1 together results in an approximately 400,000-fold increase in I-TAC mRNA expression, whereas stimulating monocytes with either of the cytokines alone or in combination results in only a 100-fold increase in the level of I-TAC transcript. Moderate expression is also observed in pancreas, lung, thymus, and spleen. The high level of expression in IFN- and IL-1-stimulated astrocytes suggests that I-TAC could be a major chemoattractant for effector T cells involved in the pathophysiology of neuroinflammatory disorders, although I-TAC may also play a role in the migration of activated T cells during IFN-dominated immune responses.']},\n",

Differential receptor engagement can transduce distinct cellular signals and effects as well as alter the amount of free, extracellular chemokine. CXCR4 binds both monomeric and the more commonly found dimeric forms of CXCL12, whereas ACKR3 binds monomeric forms. Here, we found that CXCL12 also bound to the atypical receptor ACKR1 (previously known as Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines or DARC). In vitro nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that dimeric CXCL12 bound to the extracellular N terminus of ACKR1 with low nanomolar affinity, whereas the binding affinity of monomeric CXCL12 was orders of magnitude lower. In transfected MDCK cells and primary human Duffy-positive erythrocytes, a dimeric, but not a monomeric, construct of CXCL12 efficiently bound to and internalized with ACKR1. This interaction between CXCL12 and ACKR1 provides another layer of regulation of the multiple biological functions of CXCL12. The findings also raise the possibility that ACKR1 can bind other dimeric chemokines, thus potentially further expanding the role of ACKR1 in chemokine retention and presentation.']},\n",

Here we show that CXCL12, the only known natural ligand for CXCR4, binds to and signals through RDC1. We demonstrate that RDC1 is expressed in T lymphocytes and that CXCL12-promoted chemotaxis is inhibited by an anti-RDC1 monoclonal antibody. Concomitant blockade of RDC1 and CXCR4 produced additive inhibitory effects in CXCL12-induced T cell migration. Furthermore, we provide evidence that interaction of CXCL12 with RDC1 is specific, saturable, and of high affinity (apparent KD approximately 0.4 nM). In CXCR4-negative cells expressing RDC1, CXCL12 promotes internalization of the receptor and chemotactic signals through RDC1.

       "   'CXCR7 is an atypical chemokine receptor that signals through Î²-arrestin in response to agonists without detectable activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Its cognate chemokine ligand CXCL12 also binds CXCR4, a chemokine receptor of considerable clinical interest. Here we report that TC14012, a peptidomimetic inverse agonist of CXCR4, is an agonist on CXCR7. The potency of Î²-arrestin recruitment to CXCR7 by TC14012 is much higher than that of the previously reported CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 and differs only by one log from that of the natural ligand CXCL12 (EC(50) 350 nM for TC14012, as compared with 30 nM for CXCL12 and 140 Î¼M for AMD3100). Moreover, like CXCL12, TC14012 leads to Erk 1/2 activation in U373 glioma cells that express only CXCR7, but not CXCR4. Given that with TC14012 and AMD3100 two structurally unrelated CXCR4 antagonists turn out to be agonists on CXCR7, this likely reflects differences in the activation mechanism of the arrestin pathway by both receptors. To identify the receptor domain responsible for these opposed effects, we investigated CXCR4 and CXCR7 C terminus-swapping chimeras. Using quantitative bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, we find that the CXCR7 receptor core formed by the seven-transmembrane domains and the connecting loops determines the agonistic activity of both TC14012 and AMD3100. Moreover, we find that the CXCR7 chimera bearing the CXCR4 C-terminal constitutively associates with arrestin in the absence of ligands. Our data suggest that the CXCR4 and CXCR7 cores share ligand-binding surfaces for the binding of the synthetic ligands, indicating that CXCR4 inhibitors should be tested also on CXCR7.']},\n",

In its native state, gp120(LAI) is able to elicit specific multimolecular complexes with these membrane ligands at the surface of the cells; most of the interactions are abolished by mannan or heparin but not by dextran. Similarly, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha interacts not only with CXCR4 expressed by CXCR4(+) CD4(+) U937, CEM, and HOS-CD4(+) CXCR4(+) cells but also with CD4 expressed by intact U937, CEM, and HOS-CD4(+) CXCR4(+/-) cells or electroblotted onto Immobilon. SDF-1alpha binding to CD4(+) CXCR4(+/-) cells, or soluble CD4 electroblotted onto Immobilon, is significantly inhibited by sCD4, whereas truncated sCD4 lacking D3 and D4 domains had no significant effect, which indicates that SDF-1 binds to CD4 but at regions different from the HIV-gp120-binding site. Heparin and mannan also inhibit SDF-1alpha binding to intact CD4(+) CXCR4(+/-) cells, and electroblotted soluble CD4. Heparitinase treatment of such cells reduced SDF-1alpha binding. These data demonstrate that glycans and glycosaminoglycans are directly or indirectly involved in the interactions of HIV-1 gp120(LAI) and of SDF-1alpha with membrane ligands of CD4(+) CXCR4(+) cells and thus could play a role both in HIV-1 infection and in the physiology of SDF-1alpha.']},\n",

Certain members of the CXC chemokine family can induce bovine capillary endothelial cell migration in vitro and corneal angiogenesis in vivo, and apparently act via binding to their receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. We used an RNAse protection assay that permitted the simultaneous detection of mRNA for various CXC chemokine receptors in resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and detected low levels of only CXCR4 mRNA. Stimulation of HUVECs with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) up-regulated levels of only CXCR4 mRNA. CXCR4 specifically binds the chemokine stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha). Competitive binding studies using 125I-labeled SDF-1alpha with Scatchard analysis indicated that VEGF or bFGF induced an average number of approximately 16,600 CXCR4 molecules per endothelial cell, with a Kd = 1.23 x 10(-9) mol/L. These receptors were functional as HUVECs and human aorta endothelial cells (HAECs) migrated toward SDF-1alpha. Although SDF-1alpha-induced chemotaxis was inhibited by the addition of a neutralizing monoclonal CXCR4 antibody, endothelial chemotaxis toward VEGF was not altered; therefore, the angiogenic effect of VEGF is independent of SDF-1alpha. Furthermore, subcutaneous SDF-1alpha injections into mice induced formation of local small blood vessels that was accompanied by leukocytic infiltrates. To test whether these effects were dependent on circulating leukocytes, we successfully obtained SDF-1alpha-induced neovascularization from cross sections of leukocyte-free rat aorta. Taken together, our data indicate that SDF-1alpha acts as a potent chemoattractant for endothelial cells of different origins bearing CXCR4 and is a participant in angiogenesis that is regulated at the receptor level by VEGF and bFGF.',\n",
       "   'Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) enhances survival of myeloid progenitor cells. The two main questions addressed by us were whether these effects on the progenitors were direct-acting and if SDF-1/CXCL12 enhanced engrafting capability of competitive, repopulating mouse stem cells subjected to short-term ex vivo culture with other growth factors. SDF-1/CXCL12 had survival-enhancing/antiapoptosis effects on human bone marrow (BM) and cord blood (CB) and mouse BM colony-forming units (CFU)-granulocyte macrophage, burst-forming units-erythroid, and CFU-granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte with similar dose responses. The survival effects were direct-acting, as assessed on colony formation by single isolated human BM and CB CD34(+++) cells. Effects were mediated through CXCR4 and G(alpha)i proteins. Moreover, SDF-1/CXCL12 greatly enhanced the engrafting capability of mouse long-term, marrow-competitive, repopulating stem cells cultured ex vivo with interleukin-6 and steel factor for 48 h. These results extend information on the survival effects mediated through the SDF-1/CXCL12-CXCR4 axis and may be of relevance for ex vivo expansion and gene-transduction procedures.',\n",
       "   'After tissue damage, inflammatory cells infiltrate the tissue and release proinflammatory cytokines. HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1), a nuclear protein released by necrotic and severely stressed cells, promotes cytokine release via its interaction with the TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) receptor and cell migration via an unknown mechanism. We show that HMGB1-induced recruitment of inflammatory cells depends on CXCL12. HMGB1 and CXCL12 form a heterocomplex, which we characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and surface plasmon resonance, that acts exclusively through CXCR4 and not through other HMGB1 receptors. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer data show that the HMGB1-CXCL12 heterocomplex promotes different conformational rearrangements of CXCR4 from that of CXCL12 alone. Mononuclear cell recruitment in vivo into air pouches and injured muscles depends on the heterocomplex and is inhibited by AMD3100 and glycyrrhizin.

       "   \"Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that activate and direct the migration of leukocytes. There are two subfamilies, the CXC and the CC chemokines. We recently found that the CXC-chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a highly efficacious lymphocyte chemoattractant. Chemokines act on responsive leukocyte subsets through G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors, which are also used by distinct strains of HIV-1 as cofactors for viral entry. Laboratory-adapted and some T-cell-line-tropic (T-tropic) primary viruses use the orphan chemokine receptor LESTR/fusin (also known as fusin), whereas macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 isolates use CCR-5 and CCR-3 (refs 7-11), which are receptors for known CC chemokines. Testing of potential receptors demonstrated that SDF-1 signalled through, and hence 'adopted', the orphan receptor LESTR, which we therefore designate CXC-chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR-4). SDF-1 induced an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ and chemotaxis in CXCR-4-transfected cells. Because SDF-1 is a biological ligand for the HIV-1 entry cofactor LESTR, we tested whether it inhibited HIV-1. SDF-1 inhibited infection by T-tropic HIV-1 of HeLa-CD4 cells, CXCR-4 transfectants, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but did not affect CCR-5-mediated infection by macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) and dual-tropic primary HIV-1.\",\n",

We report here the indentification of a human chemokine of the CXC type, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), as the natural ligand for LESTR/fusin, and we propose the term CXCR-4 for this receptor, in keeping with the new chemokine-receptor nomenclature. SDF-1 activates Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with CXCR-4 cDNA as well as blood leukocytes and lymphocytes. In cell lines expressing CXCR-4 and CD4, and in blood lymphocytes, SDF-1 is a powerful inhibitor of infection by lymphocyte-tropic HIV-1 strains, whereas the CC chemokines RANTES, MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta, which were shown previously to prevent infection with primary, monocyte-tropic viruses, are inactive. In combination with CC chemokines, which block the infection with monocyte/macrophage-tropic viruses, SDF-1 could help to decrease virus load and prevent the emergence of the syncytium-inducing viruses which are characteristic of the late stages of AIDS.',\n",

We found that these T cell lines bind SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta with high affinity. The CXCR4 Ab 12G5 inhibited both SDF-1 binding and HIV-1LAI-mediated fusion of CEM. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of approximately 150,000 SDF-1alpha-binding sites per cell with a Kd between 5 and 10 nM. Cross-competition experiments using unlabeled SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta revealed that both chemokines are equally capable of displacing their radiolabeled counterparts. Internalization studies with [125]I-SDF-1alpha revealed that Jurkat cells internalized greater than 90% of the ligand by 2 h at 37 degrees C. SDF-1alpha was also chemotactic for Jurkat cells and caused an increase in the rate of extracellular acidification that was half-maximal at 18 nM SDF-1alpha and could be inhibited by pretreatment with the SDF-1 proteins, pertussis toxin, or the Ab 12G5. Finally, SDF-1alpha also caused an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in Sup-T1 cells that was abolished by preincubating the cells with pertussis toxin or PMA and inhibited by the Ab 12G5. This molecular characterization of CXCR4 receptors should prove useful in clarifying receptor interaction with SDF-1 proteins and with HIV-1 glycoprotein, with the ultimate aim of targeting the viral interaction for therapeutic intervention.',\n",

       "  'Abstracts': [\"Although most leukocytes, T lymphocytes in particular, respond to several different chemokines, there is virtually no information on chemokine activities and chemokine receptors in B lymphocytes. A putative chemokine receptor, BLR1, that is expressed in Burkitt's lymphoma cells and B lymphocytes was cloned a few years ago. Deletion of the gene for BLR1 yielded mice with abnormal primary follicles and germinal centers of the spleen and Peyer's patches, reflecting the inability of B lymphocytes to migrate into B cell areas. By screening expressed sequence tag DNA sequences, we have identified a CXC chemokine, termed B cell-attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1), that is chemotactic for human B lymphocytes. BCA-1 cDNA encodes a protein of 109 amino acids with a leader sequence of 22 residues. The mature protein shares 23-34% identical amino acids with known CXC chemokines and is constitutively expressed in secondary lymphoid organs. BCA-1 was chemically synthesized and tested for activity on murine pre-B cells 300-19 transfected with BLR1 and on human blood B lymphocytes. In transfected cells, BCA-1 induced chemotaxis and Ca2+ mobilization demonstrating that it acts via BLR1. Under the same conditions, no activity was obtained with 10 CXC and 19 CC chemokines, lymphotactin, neurotactin/fractalkine and several other peptide ligands. BCA-1 was also a highly effective attractant for human blood B lymphocytes (which express BLR1), but was inactive on freshly isolated or IL-2-stimulated T lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. In agreement with the nomenclature rules for chemokine receptors, we propose the term CXCR5 for BLR1. Together with the observed disturbance of B cell colonization in BLR1/ CXCR5-deficient mice, the present results indicate that chemotactic recruitment by locally produced BCA-1 is important for the development of B cell areas of secondary lymphoid tissues.\",\n",
       "   \"Secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer's patches) are divided into compartments, such as B-cell zones (follicles) and T-cell zones, which provide specialized environments for specific steps of the immune response. Migration of lymphocyte subsets into these compartments is essential for normal immune function, yet the molecular cues guiding this cellular traffic are poorly defined. Chemokines constitute a family of chemotactic cytokines that have been shown to direct the migration of leukocytes during inflammation and which may be involved in the constitutive homing of lymphocytes into follicles and T-cell zones. Here we describe a novel chemokine, B-lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC), that is strongly expressed in the follicles of Peyer's patches, the spleen and lymph nodes. BLC strongly attracts B lymphocytes while promoting migration of only small numbers of T cells and macrophages, and therefore is the first chemokine to be identified that is selective towards B cells. An orphan chemokine receptor, Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (BLR-1), has been found to be required for B-cell migration into lymphoid follicles. We show that BLC stimulates calcium influx into, and chemotaxis of, cells transfected with BLR-1. Our results indicate that BLC functions as a BLR-1 ligand and may guide B lymphocytes to follicles in secondary lymphoid organs.\"]},\n",

A recombinant version of CXCL16 fails to mediate chemotaxis to all known chemokine receptor transfectants tested but does mediate robust chemotaxis, high affinity binding, and calcium mobilization to Bonzo receptor transfectants, indicating that this is a unique receptor ligand interaction.

CXCL16 is expressed on the surface of APCs including subsets of CD19(+) B cells and CD14(+) monocyte/macrophages, and functional CXCL16 is also shed from macrophages.

       "   'CXCL16, a recently discovered transmembrane chemokine, is expressed in human aortic smooth muscle cell (ASMC). It facilitates uptake of low density lipoproteins by macrophages, resulting in foam cell formation. However, it is not known whether ASMC express CXCR6, the receptor for CXCL16, or whether CXCL16 affects ASMC biology. To dissect the biological and signal transduction pathways elicited by CXCL16, human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were treated with pharmacological inhibitors or transiently transfected with pathway-specific dominant-negative or kinase-dead expression vectors prior to the addition of CXCL16. HASMC expressed CXCR6 at basal conditions. Exposure of HASMC to CXCL16 increased NF-kappa B DNA binding activity, induced kappa B-driven luciferase activity, and up-regulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in an NF-kappa B-dependent manner. However, treatment with pertussis toxin (G(i) inhibitor), wortmannin or LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K inhibitors)), or Akt inhibitor or overexpression of dominant-negative (dn) PI3K gamma, dnPDK-1, kinase-dead (kd) Akt, kdIKK-beta, dnIKK-gamma, dnI kappa B-alpha, or dnI kappa B-beta significantly attenuated CXCL16-induced NF-kappa B activation. Furthermore, CXCL16 increased cell-cell adhesion and induced cellular proliferation in an NF-kappa B-dependent manner. In conclusion, CXCL16 is a potent and direct activator of NF-kappaB and induces kappa B-dependent proinflammatory gene transcription. CXCL16-mediated NF-kappa B activation occurred via heterotrimeric G proteins, PI3K, PDK-1, Akt, and I kappa B kinase (IKK). CXCL16 induced I kappa B phosphorylation and degradation. Most importantly, CXCL16 increased cell-cell adhesion and induced kappa B-dependent ASMC proliferation, indicating that CXCL16 may play an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease.',\n",

The results showed that DARC selectively bound distinct members of the pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL2, CCL5 and CCL7, but not lymphoid chemokines such as CCL21, CCL19, CXCL12 and CXCL13 that are normally expressed in HEV. CCL2 bound to DARC failed to induce a significant cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation in CCR2B-expressing cells, whereas the free form of CCL2 induced a distinct [Ca(2+)] elevation, suggesting that DARC down-regulates activities of pro-inflammatory chemokines upon binding. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding DARC did not induce any obvious changes in the cell number or leukocyte subsets in the peripheral and mesenteric LN. Neither did DARC deficiency significantly affect lymphocyte migration into LN. These results suggest that DARC may be a scavenger for pro-inflammatory chemokines, but not a presenting molecule for lymphoid chemokines at HEV and that it is probably functionally dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking to HEV-bearing lymphoid tissues under physiological conditions.',\n",

The rank order of agonist potency, based on inspection of the mean effective concentration values (EC50), for IL8RB was GROgamma (1 nM) > IL-8 (4 nM) approximately GROalpha (5 nM) approximately GRObeta (4 nM) approximately NAP-2 (7 nM) > ENA-78 (11 nM), and for IL8RA was IL-8 (4 nM) >>> ENA-78 (40 nM) approximately NAP-2 (45 nM) > GROalpha (63 nM) approximately GROgamma (65 nM) >> GRObeta.

Accordingly, studies in human and animal models have revealed evidence for the presence of several quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to BMD variations. However, the identification of BMD QTL genes remains a big challenge. In the current study, we focused our efforts to identify the BMD candidate gene in chromosome 1 (Chr 1) QTL that was detected from a cross involving high BMD CAST/EiJ (CAST) and low BMD C57BL/6J (B6) mice. To this end, we have combined several approaches including: (1) fine mapping the BMD QTL in Chr 1 of the B6.CAST F2 female mice using a large number of polymorphic markers; (2) the generation of congenic sublines of mice by repeated backcrossing of CAST with B6 mice and phenotype characterization; (3) expression profiling genes in the QTL region; and (4) SNP analyses to identify the mouse Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (Darc) as a candidate gene for Chr 1 BMD QTL2. We verified the involvement of the Darc protein in BMD variation by evaluating the skeletal phenotype of Darc-knockout mice and congenic sublines of mice carrying small chromosomal segments from CAST BMD QTL. Based on the findings that Darc-antibody blocked formation of multinucleated osteoclasts in vitro and that Darc from CAST binds chemokines, known to regulate osteoclast formation, with reduced affinity compared with Darc from B6 mice, we conclude that Darc regulates BMD negatively by increasing osteoclast formation, and that the genetic association between Darc gene polymorphism and BMD variations in humans merits investigation.']},\n",

       "   'Interleukin 8 (IL-8) and melanocyte growth-stimulatory activity/gro (MGSA) are structurally related proinflammatory cytokines that are chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils.

These two receptors have 77% amino acid identity and are members of the G protein-coupled superfamily of receptors with seven transmembrane domains. We have expressed these two receptors in mammalian cells and find that in this system both receptors bind IL-8 with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The receptor affinities differ for MGSA, however. IL-8R-A binds MGSA with low affinity (Kd approximately 450 nM); IL-8R-B binds MGSA with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The transfected cells respond to ligand binding with a transient increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. A Ca2+ response is found for IL-8R-A following the binding of IL-8; no response is found for MGSA. A Ca2+ response for IL-8R-B follows the binding of both ligands. Blot hybridization with oligonucleotide probes specific for the two receptors shows that mRNA for both receptors is present in human neutrophils. Analysis of IL-8 and MGSA binding data on neutrophils as well as Ca2+ response and desensitization data shows that the presence of these two IL-8 receptors on the cell surface can account for the profile of these two ligands on neutrophils.',\n",

       "   'The mechanisms by which chemokines bind and signal through their receptors are complex and poorly understood. In the present study, we sought to dissect these processes and to map important functional domains of the two CXC chemokine (interleukin-8) receptors, CXCR1 (formally IL-8RA) and CXCR2 (formally IL-8RB), using blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the receptors and a series of chimeras between CXCR1 and CXCR2. A panel of specific mAbs against CXCR1 or CXCR2, generated by immunizing mice with transfectants expressing either receptor, were shown to effectively block IL-8- and/or growth-related oncogene alpha (GROalpha) -mediated ligand binding, chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding in CXCR1 and CXCR2 transfectants and/or human neutrophils. Of particular interest was an anti-CXCR1 mAb, 7D9, that inhibited chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding but had no detectable effects on ligand binding. The epitopes of these blocking mAbs were mapped by using a series of CXCR1/2 chimera transfectants and synthetic peptides. Most of the anti-CXCR1 antibodies, except 7D9, mapped to the amino acid sequence WDFDDL (CXCR1 residues 10-15), and all the anti-CXCR2 antibodies mapped to the amino acid sequence FEDFW (CXCR2 residues 6-10). The epitope of mAb 7D9 mainly involved a region within the first 45 residues of CXCR1, and it appeared to be conformation-sensitive. These results support a model in which the binding and signaling of IL-8 with its receptor occur in at least two discrete steps involving distinct domains of the receptor. This model is consistent with the notion that discrete conformational changes of the receptor secondary to ligand binding are required to trigger various biological responses. Moreover, the ligand binding and chemotaxis properties of each CXCR1/2 chimeric receptor to IL-8 and GROalpha were determined. It was found that each is distinct in its ability to confer ligand binding and chemotactic response to IL-8 and GROalpha, and two conclusions could be made. 1) The N-terminal segment of CXCR1 is a dominant determinant of receptor subtype selectivity, consistent with previous studies using rabbit/human CXCR1/2 chimeras; and 2) the specificity determinant for GROalpha binding in CXCR2 involves sequences in the N terminus, distal to the first 15 residues, as well as other parts of the receptor.']},\n",

Both IL-8 (a CXCR1/CXCR2 ligand) and the CXCR2-specific ligand GROalpha differentially inhibited binding of (125)I-IL-8((3-73))K11R to neutrophils, albeit weakly, suggesting that IL-8((3-73))K11R is a high affinity ligand for both the CXCR1 and CXCR2. Thus IL-8((3-73))K11R is an excellent candidate for further studies aimed at generating a high affinity IL-8 antagonist.',\n",
       "   'Interleukin 8 (IL-8) and melanocyte growth-stimulatory activity/gro (MGSA) are structurally related proinflammatory cytokines that are chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils. Recently, cDNA clones encoding a high affinity IL-8 receptor (IL-8R-A) and a \"low affinity\" IL-8 receptor (IL-8R-B) have been isolated from human cDNA libraries. These two receptors have 77% amino acid identity and are members of the G protein-coupled superfamily of receptors with seven transmembrane domains. We have expressed these two receptors in mammalian cells and find that in this system both receptors bind IL-8 with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The receptor affinities differ for MGSA, however. IL-8R-A binds MGSA with low affinity (Kd approximately 450 nM); IL-8R-B binds MGSA with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The transfected cells respond to ligand binding with a transient increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. A Ca2+ response is found for IL-8R-A following the binding of IL-8; no response is found for MGSA. A Ca2+ response for IL-8R-B follows the binding of both ligands. Blot hybridization with oligonucleotide probes specific for the two receptors shows that mRNA for both receptors is present in human neutrophils. Analysis of IL-8 and MGSA binding data on neutrophils as well as Ca2+ response and desensitization data shows that the presence of these two IL-8 receptors on the cell surface can account for the profile of these two ligands on neutrophils.',\n",

Structural and biochemical data are consistent with a noncompetitive allosteric mode of interaction between CXCR1 and Repertaxin, which, by locking CXCR1 in an inactive conformation, prevents signaling. Repertaxin is an effective inhibitor of polymorphonuclear cell recruitment in vivo and protects organs against reperfusion injury.

       "   'To determine the regions of interleukin-8 (IL-8) that allow high affinity and interleukin-8 receptor type 1 (IL8R1)-specific binding of chemokines, we produced chimeric proteins containing structural domains from IL-8, which binds to both IL8R1 and interleukin-8 receptor type 2 (IL8R2) with high affinity, and from GRO gamma, which does not bind to IL8R1 and binds to IL8R2 with reduced affinity. Receptor binding activity was tested by competition of 125I-IL-8 binding to recombinant IL8R1 and IL8R2 cell lines. Substitution into IL-8 of the GRO gamma sequences corresponding to either the amino-terminal loop (amino acids 1-18) or the first beta-sheet (amino acids 18-32) reduced binding to both IL8R1 and IL8R2. The third beta-sheet of IL-8 (amino acids 46-53) was required for binding to IL8R1 but not IL8R2. Exchanges of the second beta-sheet (amino acids 32-46) or the carboxyl-terminal alpha-helix (amino acids 53-72) had no significant effect. When IL-8 sequences were substituted into GRO gamma, a single domain containing the second beta-sheet of IL-8 (amino acids 18-32) was sufficient to confer high affinity binding for both IL8R1 and IL8R2. The amino-terminal loop (amino acids 1-18) and the third beta-sheet (amino acids 46-53) of IL-8 had little effect when substituted individually but showed increased binding to both receptors when substituted in combination. Individual amino acid substitutions were made at positions where IL-8 and GRO gamma sequences differ within the regions of residues 11-21 and 46-53. IL-8 mutations L49A or L49F selectively inhibited binding to IL8R1. Mutations Y13L and F21N enhanced binding to IL8R1 with little effect on IL8R2. A combined mutation Y13L/S14Q selectively decreased binding to IL8R2. Residues Tyr13, Ser14, Phe21, and Lys49 are clustered in and around a surface-accessible hydrophobic pocket on IL-8 that is physically distant from the previously identified ELR binding sequence. A homology model of GRO gamma, constructed from the known structure of IL-8 by refinement calculations, indicated that access to the hydrophobic pocket was effectively abolished in GRO gamma. These studies suggest that the surface hydrophobic pocket and/or adjacent residues participate in IL-8 receptor recognition for both IL8R1 and IL8R2 and that the hydrophobic pocket itself may be essential for IL8R1 binding. Thus this region contains a second site for IL-8 receptor recognition that, in combination with the Glu4-Leu5-Arg6 region, can modulate receptor binding affinity and IL8R1 specificity.',\n",

Two human chemotactic receptor subtypes for IL-8, named IL-8 receptors (IL8R) A and B, have been cloned. They are 78% identical in amino acid sequence, coexpressed in neutrophils, and distinguished by their different selectivities for GROalpha and NAP-2. Their selectivity for other ELR+ CXC chemokines has not been previously reported. By measuring calcium flux in human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with plasmids encoding IL8RA or IL8RB, we have now defined receptor selectivity for GRObeta, GROgamma, and ENA-78. The rank order of agonist potency, based on inspection of the mean effective concentration values (EC50), for IL8RB was GROgamma (1 nM) > IL-8 (4 nM) approximately GROalpha (5 nM) approximately GRObeta (4 nM) approximately NAP-2 (7 nM) > ENA-78 (11 nM), and for IL8RA was IL-8 (4 nM) >>> ENA-78 (40 nM) approximately NAP-2 (45 nM) > GROalpha (63 nM) approximately GROgamma (65 nM) >> GRObeta. The maximal response of IL8RA to IL-8 was at least 2-fold greater than the other five chemokines. All six agonists for IL8RB competed for high affinity 125I-IL-8, -GROalpha, -NAP-2, and -ENA-78 binding sites at IL8RB. GROalpha, GRObeta, GROgamma, NAP-2, and ENA-78 competed weakly for the high affinity IL-8 binding site at IL8RA. Thus, IL8RA and IL8RB are both highly selective for IL-8 and have similar sequences but differ dramatically in their selectivity for all other ELR+ CXC chemokines tested. These findings have important implications for developing novel neutrophil-specific anti-inflammatory drugs directed against the CXC chemokine signaling system.',\n",
       "   'The mechanisms by which chemokines bind and signal through their receptors are complex and poorly understood. In the present study, we sought to dissect these processes and to map important functional domains of the two CXC chemokine (interleukin-8) receptors, CXCR1 (formally IL-8RA) and CXCR2 (formally IL-8RB), using blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the receptors and a series of chimeras between CXCR1 and CXCR2. A panel of specific mAbs against CXCR1 or CXCR2, generated by immunizing mice with transfectants expressing either receptor, were shown to effectively block IL-8- and/or growth-related oncogene alpha (GROalpha) -mediated ligand binding, chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding in CXCR1 and CXCR2 transfectants and/or human neutrophils. Of particular interest was an anti-CXCR1 mAb, 7D9, that inhibited chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding but had no detectable effects on ligand binding. The epitopes of these blocking mAbs were mapped by using a series of CXCR1/2 chimera transfectants and synthetic peptides. Most of the anti-CXCR1 antibodies, except 7D9, mapped to the amino acid sequence WDFDDL (CXCR1 residues 10-15), and all the anti-CXCR2 antibodies mapped to the amino acid sequence FEDFW (CXCR2 residues 6-10). The epitope of mAb 7D9 mainly involved a region within the first 45 residues of CXCR1, and it appeared to be conformation-sensitive. These results support a model in which the binding and signaling of IL-8 with its receptor occur in at least two discrete steps involving distinct domains of the receptor. This model is consistent with the notion that discrete conformational changes of the receptor secondary to ligand binding are required to trigger various biological responses. Moreover, the ligand binding and chemotaxis properties of each CXCR1/2 chimeric receptor to IL-8 and GROalpha were determined. It was found that each is distinct in its ability to confer ligand binding and chemotactic response to IL-8 and GROalpha, and two conclusions could be made. 1) The N-terminal segment of CXCR1 is a dominant determinant of receptor subtype selectivity, consistent with previous studies using rabbit/human CXCR1/2 chimeras; and 2) the specificity determinant for GROalpha binding in CXCR2 involves sequences in the N terminus, distal to the first 15 residues, as well as other parts of the receptor.']},\n",

In endothelial culture supernatants, IL-8 was detected in a trimolecular complex with heparan sulfate and syndecan-1. Constitutive shedding of IL-8 in this form was increased in the presence of a neutralizing Ab to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), indicating a role for endothelial plasminogen activator in the shedding of IL-8. Increased shedding of IL-8/heparan sulfate/syndecan-1 complexes was accompanied by inhibition of neutrophil transendothelial migration, and aprotinin, a potent plasmin inhibitor, reversed this inhibition. Platelets, added as an exogenous source of PAI-1, had no effect on shedding of the complexes or neutrophil migration. Our results indicate that IL-8 is immobilized on the endothelial cell surface through binding to syndecan-1 ectodomains, and that plasmin, generated by endothelial plasminogen activator, induces the shedding of this form of IL-8.

While studying responses that are mediated by these two receptors, we found that the agonists for CXCR3 act as antagonists for CCR3. I-TAC, Mig, and IP10 compete for the binding of eotaxin to CCR3-bearing cells and inhibit migration and Ca(2+) changes induced in such cells by stimulation with eotaxin, eotaxin-2, MCP-2 (monocyte chemottractant protein-2), MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted). A hybrid chemokine generated by substituting the first eight NH(2)-terminal residues of eotaxin with those of I-TAC bound CCR3 with higher affinity than eotaxin or I-TAC (3- and 10-fold, respectively). The hybrid was 5-fold more potent than I-TAC as an inhibitor of eotaxin activity and was effective at concentrations as low as 5 nm. None of the antagonists described induced the internalization of CCR3, indicating that they lack agonistic effects and thus qualify as pure antagonists.

The chemokine CXCL4/PF4 shares several activities with CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, including a powerful angiostatic effect, but its specific receptor is still unknown. Here, we describe a distinct, previously unrecognized receptor named CXCR3-B, derived from an alternative splicing of the CXCR3 gene that mediates the angiostatic activity of CXCR3 ligands and also acts as functional receptor for CXCL4. Human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1), transfected with either the known CXCR3 (renamed CXCR3-A) or CXCR3-B, bound CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, whereas CXCL4 showed high affinity only for CXCR3-B.

A comparison of the rank order of K(i) values with the rank order of monocyte production levels of these three ligands revealed a precise inverse correlation, suggesting that the weaker receptor affinities of CXCL9 and CXCL10 were physiologically compensated for by an elevated expression, perhaps to maintain effectiveness of each ligand under physiological conditions.\",\n",

The receptor has very modest affinity for SDF-1alpha and little or no affinity for other CXC-chemokines. The properties of the endogenous receptor expressed on activated T-cells are similar. Surprisingly, several CC-chemokines, particularly eotaxin and MCP-4, also compete with moderate affinity for the binding of IP10 to CXCR3. Eotaxin does not activate CXCR3 but, in CXCR3-transfected cells, can block IP10-mediated receptor activation. Eotaxin, therefore, may be a natural CXCR3 antagonist.']},\n",

GPR182 is primarily upregulated in melanoma-associated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) during tumorigenesis, and this atypical chemokine receptor endocytoses chemokines promiscuously. In GPR182-deficient mice, T cell infiltration into transplanted melanomas increases, leading to enhanced effector T cell function and improved antitumor immunity.

CXCR3 blockade reverses the improved antitumor immunity and T cell infiltration characteristic of GPR182-deficient mice.

Upon de novo expression of decorin, the ErbB2 protein is reduced by approximately 40%, whereas its degree of tyrosyl phosphorylation is almost completely abrogated. Both co-culture experiments or experiments with recombinant decorin demonstrate an initial induction of ErbB2 tyrosine kinase, followed by a profound and long-lasting down-regulation of its activity. This leads to growth inhibition and cytodifferentiation of mammary tumor cells and a concurrent suppression of their tumorigenic potential in vivo. These decorin-mediated effects appear to involve the activation of ErbB4, which in turn would block the phosphorylation of heterodimers containing either ErbB2 or ErbB3. These results provide an explanation for the heightened decorin levels around invasive carcinomas and suggest that decorin may function as a natural antagonist of neoplastic cells enriched in ErbB2.']},\n",

We previously identified two decidua-derived molecules, TGF-Î² and a TGF-Î²-binding proteoglycan decorin (DCN), as negative regulators of EVT proliferation, migration, and invasiveness and reported that DCN acts via multiple tyrosine kinase receptors [epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R), IGF receptor-1 (IGFR1), and vascular endothelial growth factor 2 receptor (VEGFR-2)]. Because binding of DCN to VEGFR-2 has never been reported earlier, present study explored this binding, the approximate location of VEGFR-2-binding site in DCN, and its functional role in our human first trimester EVT cell line HTR-8/SVneo. Based on far-Western blotting and coimmunoprecipitation studies, we report that DCN binds both native (EVT expressed) and recombinant VEGFR-2 and that this binding is abrogated with a VEGFR-2 blocking antibody, indicating an overlap between the ligand-binding and the DCN-binding domains of VEGFR-2. We determined that (125)I-labeled VEGF-E (a VEGFR-2 specific ligand) binds EVT with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 566 pM, and DCN displaced this binding with an inhibition constant (K(i)) of 3.93-5.78 nM, indicating a 7- to 10-fold lower affinity of DCN for VEGFR-2. DCN peptide fragments derived from the leucine rich repeat 5 domain that blocked DCN-VEGFR-2 interactions or VEGF-E binding in EVT cells also blocked VEGF-A- and VEGF-E-induced EVT cell proliferation and migration, indicative of functional VEGFR-2-binding sites of DCN. Finally, DCN inhibited VEGF-E-induced EVT migration by interfering with ERK1/2 activation. Our findings reveal a novel role of DCN as an antagonistic ligand for VEGFR-2, having implications for pathophysiology of preeclampsia, a trophoblast hypoinvasive disorder in pregnancy, and explain its antiangiogenic function.']},\n",

Decorin has a complex binding repertoire, thus, we predicted that decorin would modulate the bioactivity of other tyrosine kinase receptors. We discovered that decorin binds directly and with high affinity (K(d) = approximately 1.5 nM) to Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Binding of decorin to Met is efficiently displaced by HGF and less efficiently by internalin B, a bacterial Met ligand. Interaction of decorin with Met induces transient receptor activation, recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, and rapid intracellular degradation of Met (half-life = approximately 6 min). Decorin suppresses intracellular levels of beta-catenin, a known downstream Met effector, and inhibits Met-mediated cell migration and growth. Thus, by antagonistically targeting multiple tyrosine kinase receptors, decorin contributes to reduction in primary tumor growth and metastastic spreading.']},\n",

First, decorin acted as an endogenous ligand of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 and stimulated production of proinflammatory molecules, including PDCD4, in macrophages. Second, decorin prevented translational repression of PDCD4 by decreasing the activity of transforming growth factor-Î²1 and the abundance of oncogenic miR-21, a translational inhibitor of PDCD4. Moreover, increased PDCD4 abundance led to decreased release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, thereby making the cytokine profile more proinflammatory.

Decorin was an early response gene evoked by septic inflammation, and protein concentrations of decorin were increased in the plasma of septic patients and mice.

In the present study, we explored the important structural elements of hBD-3 that are involved in blocking CXCR4 activation by its natural ligand, stromal-derived factor 1Î± (SDF-1Î±; CXCL12). Results from site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that the ability of hBD-3 to inhibit SDF-1Î±-CXCR4 interaction, as assayed either by blocking SDF-1 binding to CXCR4 or antagonizing SDF-1-induced Ca(2+) mobilization, is correlated with the presence of hBD-3 cysteine residues, specific surface-distributed cationic residues, and the electrostatic properties and availability of both hBD-3 termini. Specifically, hBD-3 activity against CXCR4 is reduced by: (a) replacing all six cysteines; (b) replacing the cationic residues with acidic ones in the N-terminus and C- terminus; (c) removal of the first 10 N-terminal residues; and (d) replacing the surface-exposed basic residues Lys8, Lys32 and Arg36 with neutral ones. The hBD-3-CXCR4 interaction has potentially wide-ranging implications for HIV-related biology, as well as for a host of CXCR4-dependent activities, including hematopoiesis, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, carcinogenesis, and immune cell trafficking. CXCR4 is highly expressed on T cells, monocytes, and epithelial cells.

Lrp4 shares structural elements within the extracellular ligand binding domain with Lrp5 and Lrp6, two established Wnt co-receptors with important roles in osteogenesis. Sclerostin is a potent osteocyte secreted inhibitor of bone formation that directly binds Lrp5 and Lrp6 and modulates both BMP and Wnt signaling. The anti-osteogenic effect of sclerostin is thought to be mediated mainly by inhibition of Wnt signaling through Lrp5/6 within osteoblasts. Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) is another potent soluble Wnt inhibitor that binds to Lrp5 and Lrp6, can displace Lrp5-bound sclerostin and is itself regulated by BMPs. In a recent genome-wide association study of bone mineral density a significant modifier locus was detected near the SOST gene at 17q21, which encodes sclerostin. In addition, nonsynonymous SNPs in the LRP4 gene were suggestively associated with bone mineral density. Here we show that Lrp4 is expressed in bone and cultured osteoblasts and binds Dkk1 and sclerostin in vitro.

Dkk-1 demonstrated no interaction with Wnt but bound a single cell surface site with high affinity (K(D) = 0.39 nM). Its receptor was detectable in a complex with a relative molecular mass of 240,000 (M(r) 240K) with [(125)I] Dkk-1 by covalent affinity cross-linking. Wnt signalling through beta-catenin is mediated by the Fz receptor and a recently identified low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related co-receptor, LRP6/Arrow. Overproduction of the 200K LRP6 protein, but not of Fz, strikingly increased Dkk-1 binding as well as the amount of the 240K cross-linked complex, which was shown to be composed of Dkk-1 and LRP6. Moreover, Dkk-1 function was completely independent of Fz but LRP6 dramatically interfered with the Dkk-1 inhibition of Wnt signalling. Thus, unlike Wnt antagonists, which exert their effects by molecular mimicry of Fz or Wnt sequestration through other mechanisms, Dkk-1 specifically inhibits canonical Wnt signalling by binding to the LRP6 component of the receptor complex.',\n",

In previous reports, we demonstrated that DLK1 interacts with itself and with specific EGF-like repeats of the NOTCH1 extracellular region involved in the binding to NOTCH1 canonical ligands. Moreover, the interaction of DLK1 with NOTCH1 caused an inhibition of basal NOTCH signaling in preadipocytes and mesenchymal multipotent cells. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, that DLK2 interacts with itself, with DLK1, and with the same NOTCH1 receptor region as DLK1 does. We demonstrate also that the interaction of DLK2 with NOTCH1 similarly results in an inhibition of NOTCH signaling in preadipocytes and Mouse Embryo fibloblasts. In addition, we demonstrate that a membrane DLK1 variant, lacking the sequence recognized by the protease TACE, also inhibits NOTCH signaling. Furthermore, both DLK1 and DLK2 are able to decrease NOTCH activity also when triggered by specific NOTCH ligands. However, the decrease in NOTCH signaling induced by overexpression of Dlk2 is reversed by the overexpression of Dlk1, and viceversa. We conclude that DLK1 and DLK2 act as inhibitory non-canonical protein ligands for the NOTCH1 receptor that modulate NOTCH signaling.']},\n",

       "   'The Notch receptor is involved in many cell fate determination events in vertebrates and invertebrates. It has been shown in Drosophila melanogaster that Delta-dependent Notch signaling activates the transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless, leading to an increased expression of the Enhancer of Split genes. Genetic evidence has also implicated the kuzbanian gene, which encodes a disintegrin metalloprotease, in the Notch signaling pathway. By using a two-cell coculture assay, we show here that vertebrate Dl-1 activates the Notch-1 cascade. Consistent with previous data obtained with active forms of Notch-1 a HES-1-derived promoter construct is transactivated in cells expressing Notch-1 in response to Dl-1 stimulation. Impairing the proteolytic maturation of the full-length receptor leads to a decrease in HES-1 transactivation, further supporting the hypothesis that only mature processed Notch is expressed at the cell surface and activated by its ligand. Furthermore, we observed that Dl-1-induced HES-1 transactivation was dependent both on Kuzbanian and RBP-J activities, consistent with the involvement of these two proteins in Notch signaling in Drosophila. We also observed that exposure of Notch-1-expressing cells to Dl-1 results in an increased level of endogenous HES-1 mRNA. Finally, coculture of Dl-1-expressing cells with myogenic C2 cells suppresses differentiation of C2 cells into myotubes, as previously demonstrated for Jagged-1 and Jagged-2, and also leads to an increased level of endogenous HES-1 mRNA. Thus, Dl-1 behaves as a functional ligand for Notch-1 and has the same ability to suppress cell differentiation as the Jagged proteins do.']},\n",

In this report, we investigated these issues for Notch2. All of the three DSL proteins bound to endogenous Notch2 on the surface of BaF3 cells, although characteristics of Jagged2 for binding to Notch2 apparently differed from that of Delta1 and Jagged1. After binding, the three DSL proteins induced cleavage of the membrane-spanning subunit of Notch2 (Notch2(TM)), which occurred within 15 min. In a simultaneous time course, the cleaved fragment of Notch2(TM) was translocated into the nucleus. Interestingly, the cleaved Notch2 fragment was hyperphosphorylated also in a time-dependent manner. Finally, binding of DSL proteins to Notch2 also activated the transcription of reporter genes driven by the RBP-Jkappa-responsive promoter. Together, these data indicate that all of these DSL proteins function as ligands for Notch2.

Mutations in the EGF repeats of the human Notch 3 receptor lead to the vascular dementia disease Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). The vast majority of CADASIL mutations are missense mutations removing or inserting cysteine residues in the EGF repeats, but it is not yet clear whether these mutations primarily affect receptor trafficking, maturation, andor signaling. To address this issue, we have generated and analyzed stable cell lines expressing either wild-type murine Notch 3 (mNotch 3) or the mutant mNotch 3(R142C), which corresponds to the prevalent CADASIL form of Notch 3, Notch 3(R141C) in humans. We find that a lower proportion of mNotch 3(R142C) is expressed in the site 1-cleaved configuration, and that reduced amounts of mNotch 3(R142C) appear at the cell surface, as compared with wild-type mNotch 3. This observation is accompanied by a higher propensity for mNotch 3(R142C) to form intracellular aggregates, which may be a result of increased accumulation or slowed transport in the secretory pathway. In contrast to the impaired cell surface expression, mNotch 3(R142C) signals equally well in response to Delta 1 and Jagged 1 as wild-type mNotch 3.

Similar fragments of bone sialoprotein, like the intact protein, did not functionally interact with CD44.

Netrin-1, a bifunctional guidance cue, binds to deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and DSCAM mediating axon attraction, and UNC5 mediating axon repulsion. Here, we show that DSCAM interacts with UNC5C and this interaction is stimulated by netrin-1 in primary cortical neurons and postnatal cerebellar granule cells. DSCAM partially co-localized with UNC5C in primary neurons and brain tissues. Netrin-1 induces axon growth cone collapse of mouse cerebellum external granule layer (EGL) cells, and the knockdown of DSCAM or UNC5C by specific shRNAs or blocking their signaling by overexpressing dominant negative mutants suppresses netrin-1-induced growth cone collapse. Similarly, the simultaneous knockdown of DSCAM and UNC5C also blocks netrin-1-induced growth cone collapse in EGL cells. Netrin-1 increases tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous DSCAM, UNC5C, FAK, Fyn, and PAK1, and promotes complex formation of DSCAM with these signaling molecules in primary postnatal cerebellar neurons. Inhibition of Src family kinases efficiently reduces the interaction of DSCAM with UNC5C, FAK, Fyn, and PAK1 and tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins as well as growth cone collapse of mouse EGL cells induced by netrin-1. The knockdown of DSCAM inhibits netrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of UNC5C and Fyn as well as the interaction of UNC5C with Fyn. The double knockdown of both receptors abolishes the induction of Fyn tyrosine phosphorylation by netrin-1.

Using DSP as bait for screening a protein library, we demonstrate that DSP acts as a ligand and binds to integrin Î²6. The 36 amino acid residues of DSP are sufficient to bind to integrin Î²6. This peptide promoted cell attachment, migration, differentiation and mineralization of dental mesenchymal cells. In addition, DSP (aa183-219) stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P38 kinases. This activation was inhibited by an anti-integrin Î²6 antibody and siRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this DSP fragment induces SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation via ERK1/2 and P38 signaling. SMAD1/5/8 binds to SMAD binding elements (SBEs) in the DSPP gene promoter. SBE mutations result in a decrease in DSPP transcriptional activity. Endogenous DSPP expression was up-regulated by DSP (aa183-219) in dental mesenchymal cells.

Interestingly, our results indicated that ECM1 directly interacted with integrin Î²4 (ITGB4) and activated ITGB4/focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² signaling pathway, which further induced the expression of transcription factor SOX2. Aberrant expression of SOX2 altered gene expression of EMT factors and glucose metabolism enzymes.

By using a subclone of 293F cells with stable expression of XEDAR, we report that XEDAR activates the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. Treatment with EDA-A2 leads to the recruitment of TRAF3 and -6 to the aggregated XEDAR complex, suggesting a central role of these adaptors in the proximal aspect of XEDAR signaling. Whereas TRAF3 and -6, IKK1/IKKalpha, IKK2/IKKbeta, and NEMO/IKKgamma are involved in XEDAR-induced NF-kappaB activation, XEDAR-induced JNK activation seems to be mediated via a pathway dependent on TRAF3, TRAF6, and ASK1. Deletion and point mutagenesis studies delineate two distinct regions in the cytoplasmic domain of XEDAR, which are involved in binding to TRAF3 and -6, respectively, and play a major role in the activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Taken together, our results establish a major role of TRAF3 and -6 in XEDAR signaling and in the process of ectodermal differentiation.']},\n",

The presence of authentic ET-1 in the conditioned media of FNC-B4 cells was further supported by combined RIAs and high-performance liquid chromatography studies. Experiments with radiolabeled ET-1 and ET-3 strongly indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites, corresponding to the ETA (16,500 sites/cell) and the ETB receptors (8,700 sites/cell). Functional studies, using selective analogs, indicated that these two classes of receptors subserve distinct functions in human GnRH-secreting cells. The ETA receptor subtype mediated an increase in intracellular calcium and GnRH secretion. Conversely, stimulation of the ETB subtype induced DNA synthesis and mitogen-activated protein kinase p44ERK1 expression.

In coronary artery, ET-2 was equipotent with ET-1 with an EC50 value of 5.7 nM. The non-selective peptide, sarafotoxin 6b, was 2-3 times less potent than ET-1 but the maximum responses to these two were comparable. 3. In each vessel ET-3 was much less active than ET-1. No response was obtained to ET-3 in aorta and pulmonary artery or in up to 50% of coronary artery, mammary artery and saphenous vein preparations. In those preparations that did respond, dose-response curves were incomplete at 300 nM. Variable contractions were also obtained with the ETB-selective agonist, sarafotoxin 6c (S6c). Where responses were detected, although S6c was more potent than ET-1 (EC50 values of 0.6-1.2 nM), the maximum response produced was always less than 20% of that to ET-1. 4. The synthetic ETB agonists, BQ3020 and [1,3,11,15Ala]-ET-1, were without effect in any of the five blood vessels at concentrations up to 3 microM. 5. ET-1-induced vasoconstriction was blocked by the ETA-selective antagonists, BQ123 and FR139317. Schild-derived pA2 values were 7.0, 7.4 and 6.9 for BQ123 and 7.6, 7.9 and 7.3 for FR139317 in coronary artery, mammary artery and saphenous vein, respectively, consistent with antagonism of ETA receptors. Slopes of the Schild regressions were not significantly different from one. Comparable values of pA2 were estimated for 3ftM BQ123 in aorta (7.4+/-0.5) and pulmonary artery (6.9) from the Gaddum-Schild equation.6. In conclusion we have shown that in human isolated blood vessels, ET-1 is more potent than ET-3 suggesting the presence of vasoconstrictor ETA receptors. This is supported by the lack of effect of the ETB agonists, BQ3020 and [1,3,1,1,15Ala]-ET-l and the ability of the ETA antagonists, BQ123 andFR139317 to block ET-1 responses. Some preparations did contract in response to low concentrations of the ETB-selective sarafotoxin 6c but responses were variable and the maximum was always much less than that to ET-1 in the same preparations. Therefore although constrictor ETB receptors were present on the smooth muscle of human blood vessels, vasoconstriction elicited by the endothelin peptides in vitro is via ETA receptor activation.',\n",

The affinity of this chimeric receptor, ETB-BC, for ET-3 was about two orders lower than ETB yet one order higher than ETA. Previously we have reported the involvement of Lys-140 located in the C-terminus of the second transmembrane region of the ETA receptor for ET-1 binding (Eur. J. Biochem., 220, 37-43, 1994). To assess the importance of the corresponding Lys-161 of the ETB receptor in ET-3 binding, we have replaced it with Ile in the ETB receptor. The mutant receptor had a 5.6-fold reduction in its affinity for ET-3, but its affinity for ET-1 remained similar. These results demonstrate that Lys-161 of the receptor is important for high affinity binding with ET-3 which, in part, confers the non-selective binding characteristics of the ETB receptor for ET isopeptides.',\n",
       "   '1. We determined competition binding characteristics of endothelin ETB receptor selective ligands in human left ventricle and compared these values to those obtained with rat left ventricle. Sarafotoxin S6c, ET-3, BQ788 and IRL2500 competed against [125I]-PD151242 (ETA selective radioligand) with low affinity in human left ventricle, confirming the ETB selectivity of these compounds. 2. ET-3 competed with moderate selectivity for ETB over ETA receptors in human left ventricle and with slightly higher selectivity in rat left ventricle (460 and 1,400 fold, respectively). There was a small difference in the affinity of ETA receptors for ET-3 (KD ETA in human left ventricle = 0.07 +/- 0.02 microM; KD ETA in rat left ventricle = 0.27 +/- 0.08 microM; P = 0.05) but no difference in the affinity of ETB receptors for this ligand (KD ETB in human left ventricle = 0.15 +/- 0.06 nM; KD ETB in rat left ventricle = 0.19 +/- 0.03 nM). 3. The selectivity of sarafotoxin S6c for ETB over ETA receptors in human left ventricle was 5,900 fold compared with 59,400 fold in rat left ventricle. The affinity of ETA receptors for sarafotoxin S6c was higher in human than in rat left ventricle (KD ETA = 2.00 +/- 0.20 microM and 3.50 +/- 0.26 microM, respectively; P = 0.03), while the affinity of ETB receptors for this ligand was higher in rat left ventricle (KD ETB = 0.06 +/- 0.02 nM) than in human left ventricle (KD ETB = 0.34 +/- 0.13 nM) (P = 0.02). The affinity of ETB receptors for sarafotoxin S6c in rat left ventricle determined in the absence or presence of GTP was the same indicating that differing affinity states of ETB receptors in human and rat left ventricle do not account for the variation observed between species. 4. There was no difference in the affinity of ETA receptors for BQ788 (KD ETA = 1.01 +/- 0.20 microM and KD ETA = 1.39 +/- 0.35 microM) or for the novel ETB selective antagonist. IRL2500 (KD ETA = 30.0 +/- 20.8 microM and KD ETA = 55.6 +/- 9.93 microM) in human and rat left ventricle, respectively. ETB receptors had a significantly higher affinity for BQ788 (KD ETB = 9.8 +/- 1.3 nM and KD ETB = 31.0 +/- 5.4 nM; P = 0.02) and IRL2500 (KD ETB = 78.2 +/- 9.7 nM and KD ETB = 300.0 +/- 75.1 nM; P = 0.03) in human and rat left ventricle, respectively. The synthetically synthesized ETB selective antagonist RES-701-1 (0.1 -3 microM) failed to inhibit [125I]-ET-1 binding in either tissue. 5. In conclusion, we have compared equilibrium dissociation constants for a number of ETB selective compounds in human and rat heart. The affinity of ETB receptors for sarafotoxin S6c, BQ788 and IRL2500 differed in human and rat left ventricle. No difference in affinity was detected for ET-3 binding at ETB receptors. Sarafotoxin S6c binding was unaffected by GTP indicating that the different receptor affinities in human and rat heart cannot be explained by differing ETB receptor affinity states. This study highlights the need to consider differences in binding characteristics that may arise from the use of tissues obtained from different species.']},\n",

       "  'Abstracts': ['The EGF-related protein EFEMP1 (EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1) has been shown to promote tumor growth in human adenocarcinoma. To understand the mechanism of this action, the signal transduction activated upon treatment with this protein has been investigated. We show that EFEMP1 binds EGF receptor (EGFR) in a competitive manner relative to epidermal growth factor (EGF), implicating that EFEMP1 and EGF share the same or adjacent binding sites on the EGFR. Treatment of pancreatic carcinoma cells with purified EFEMP1 activates autophosphorylation of EGFR at the positions Tyr-992 and Tyr-1068, but not at the position Tyr-1048. This signal is further transduced to phosphorylation of Akt at position Thr-308 and p44/p42 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) at positions Thr-202 and Tyr-204. These downstream phosphorylation events can be inhibited by treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor PD 153035. The observed signal transduction upon treatment with EFEMP1 can contribute to the enhancement of tumor growth shown in pancreatic carcinoma cells overexpressing EFEMP1.']},\n",

       "  'Abstracts': ['The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases plays a crucial role during development and is implicated in oncogenesis. Using a partial cDNA clone of an Eph-related kinase (Esk) we isolated the complete coding region of a gene which we show to be murine EphA1 by both structural and functional criteria. The chromosomal localization is shown to be syntenic to hEphA1 and the genomic organization also shows distinct features found in the hEphA1 gene. Functionally, in keeping with findings for the human homologue, both soluble recombinant and \"native\" mEphA1 show preferential binding to ephrin A1. However, we also observed significant binding to other A-type ligands as has been observed for other Eph receptors. We analysed the expression of mEphA1 mRNA by in situ hybridization on tissue sections. mEphA1 was expressed in epithelial elements of skin, adult thymus, kidney and adrenal cortex. Taken together with previous Northern blotting data these results suggest that mEphA1 is expressed widely in differentiated epithelial cells.',\n",
       "   'We have previously demonstrated that binding of ephrin-A1 to Eph receptors on human CD4+ T cells stimulates migration. Here, we show that a distinct population of CD8+ T lymphocytes, expressing the chemokine receptor CCR7, also binds ephrin-A1 and is stimulated to migrate after binding. The Eph receptor signaling pathway taking part in the migration event was here investigated. Induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins was seen after ephrin-A1 binding. In particular, induced phosphorylation and kinase activity of the Src kinase family member Lck was observed. An Lck inhibitor inhibited ephrin-A1-induced migration, indicating the involvement of Lck in the migration event. In addition, we observed an induced association of the focal adhesion-like kinase proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) and the guanidine exchange factor Vav1 with Lck. PI3K inhibitors also inhibited migration, and studies in transfectants indicate an association of PI3K with EphA1. Further, ephrin-A1-induced migration could be related to the activation of Rho GTPases. This was also observed by using an inhibitor of the Rho-associated kinase ROCK, a downstream effector of Rho. Our results suggest that stimulation of Eph receptors on CD8+CCR7+ T cells leads to migration involving activation of Lck, Pyk2, PI3K, Vav1 and Rho GTPase.',\n",
       "   'The Eph-ephrin receptor-ligand system is implicated in cell behavior and morphology. EphA1 is the founding member of the Eph receptors, but little is known about its function. Here, we show that activation of EphA1 kinase inhibits cell spreading and migration in a RhoA-ROCK-dependent manner. We also describe a novel interaction between EphA1 and integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a mediator of interactions between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton. The C-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain of EphA1 is required and the ankyrin region of ILK is sufficient for the interaction between EphA1 and ILK. The interaction is independent of EphA1 kinase activity but dependent on stimulation of the EphA1 ligand ephrin-A1. Activation of EphA1 kinase resulted in a decrease of ILK activity. Finally, we demonstrated that expression of a kinase-active form of ILK (S343D) rescued the EphA1-mediated spreading defect, and attenuated RhoA activation. These results suggest that EphA1 regulates cell morphology and motility through the ILK-RhoA-ROCK pathway.',\n",
       "   'The Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family includes many members, which are often expressed together in various combinations and can promiscuously interact with multiple ephrin ligands, generating intricate networks of intracellular signals that control physiological and pathological processes. Knowing the entire repertoire of Eph receptors and ephrins expressed in a biological sample is important when studying their biological roles. Moreover, given the correlation between Eph receptor/ephrin expression and cancer pathogenesis, their expression patterns could serve important diagnostic and prognostic purposes. However, profiling Eph receptor and ephrin expression has been challenging. Here we describe a novel and straightforward approach to catalog the Eph receptors present in cultured cells and tissues. By measuring the binding of ephrin Fc fusion proteins to Eph receptors in ELISA and pull-down assays, we determined that a mixture of four ephrins is suitable for isolating both EphA and EphB receptors in a single pull-down. We then used mass spectrometry to identify the Eph receptors present in the pull-downs and estimate their relative levels. This approach was validated in cultured human cancer cell lines, human tumor xenograft tissue grown in mice, and mouse brain tissue. The new mass spectrometry approach we have developed represents a useful tool for the identification of the spectrum of Eph receptors present in a biological sample and could also be extended to profiling ephrin expression.']},\n",
