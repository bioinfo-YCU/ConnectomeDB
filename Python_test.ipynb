       "  'Abstract': 'Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) family members are secreted in inactive complexes with a latency-associated peptide (LAP), a protein derived from the N-terminal region of the TGF beta gene product. Extracellular activation of these complexes is a critical but incompletely understood step in regulation of TGF beta function in vivo. We show that TGF beta 1 LAP is a ligand for the integrin alpha v beta 6 and that alpha v beta 6-expressing cells induce spatially restricted activation of TGF beta 1. This finding explains why mice lacking this integrin develop exaggerated inflammation and, as we show, are protected from pulmonary fibrosis. These data identify a novel mechanism for locally regulating TGF beta 1 function in vivo by regulating expression of the alpha v beta 6 integrin.',\n",

Here we report the identification of a new member, activation-inducible TNFR family member (AITR), which belongs to this subfamily, and its ligand. The receptor is expressed in lymph node and peripheral blood leukocytes, and its expression is up-regulated in human peripheral mononuclear cells mainly after stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin. AITR associates with TRAF1 (TNF receptor-associated factor 1), TRAF2, and TRAF3, and induces nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation via TRAF2. The ligand for AITR (AITRL) was found to be an undescribed member of the TNF family, which is expressed in endothelial cells. Thus, AITR and AITRL seem to be important for interactions between activated T lymphocytes and endothelial cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"CD44 has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, but the mechanism(s) involved is as yet poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that CD44 isoforms containing the alternatively spliced exon v3 carry heparan sulfate side chains and are able to bind heparin-binding growth factors. In the present study, we have explored the possibility of a physical and functional interaction between CD44 and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), the ligand of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met. The HGF/SF-c-Met pathway mediates cell growth and motility and has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. We demonstrate that a CD44v3 splice variant efficiently binds HGF/SF via its heparan sulfate side chain. To address the functional relevance of this interaction, Namalwa Burkitt's lymphoma cells were stably co-transfected with c-Met and either CD44v3 or the isoform CD44s, which lacks heparan sulfate. We show that, as compared with CD44s, CD44v3 promotes: (i) HGF/SF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met, (ii) phosphorylation of several downstream proteins, and (iii) activation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and -2. By heparitinase treatment and the use of a mutant HGF/SF with greatly decreased affinity for heparan sulfate, we show that the enhancement of c-Met signal transduction induced by CD44v3 was critically dependent on heparan sulfate moieties. Our results identify heparan sulfate-modified CD44 (CD44-HS) as a functional co-receptor for HGF/SF which promotes signaling through the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met, presumably by concentrating and presenting HGF/SF. As both CD44-HS and c-Met are overexpressed on several types of tumors, we propose that the observed functional collaboration might be instrumental in promoting tumor growth and metastasis.\",\n",

       "  'Title': 'Vertebrate Hedgehog signalling modulated by induction of a Hedgehog-binding protein.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The Hedgehog signalling pathway is essential for the development of diverse tissues during embryogenesis. Signalling is activated by binding of Hedgehog protein to the multipass membrane protein Patched (Ptc). We have now identified a novel component in the vertebrate signalling pathway, which we name Hip (for Hedgehog-interacting protein) because of its ability to bind Hedgehog proteins. Hip encodes a membrane glycoprotein that binds to all three mammalian Hedgehog proteins with an affinity comparable to that of Ptc-1. Hip-expressing cells are located next to cells that express each Hedgehog gene. Hip expression is induced by ectopic Hedgehog signalling and is lost in Hedgehog mutants. Thus, Hip, like Ptc-1, is a general transcriptional target of Hedgehog signalling. Overexpression of Hip in cartilage, where Indian hedgehog (Ihh) controls growth, leads to a shortened skeleton that resembles that seen when Ihh function is lost (B. St-Jacques, M. Hammerschmidt & A.P.M., in preparation). Our findings support a model in which Hip attenuates Hedgehog signalling as a result of binding to Hedgehog proteins: a negative regulatory feedback loop established in this way could thus modulate the responses to any Hedgehog signal.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The angiopoietins have recently joined the members of the vascular endothelial growth factor family as the only known growth factors largely specific for vascular endothelium. The angiopoietins include a naturally occurring agonist, angiopoietin-1, as well as a naturally occurring antagonist, angiopoietin-2, both of which act by means of the Tie2 receptor. We now report our attempts to use homology-based cloning approaches to identify new members of the angiopoietin family. These efforts have led to the identification of two new angiopoietins, angiopoietin-3 in mouse and angiopoietin-4 in human; we have also identified several more distantly related sequences that do not seem to be true angiopoietins, in that they do not bind to the Tie receptors. Although angiopoietin-3 and angiopoietin-4 are strikingly more structurally diverged from each other than are the mouse and human versions of angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2, they appear to represent the mouse and human counterparts of the same gene locus, as revealed in our chromosomal localization studies of all of the angiopoietins in mouse and human. The structural divergence of angiopoietin-3 and angiopoietin-4 appears to underlie diverging functions of these counterparts. Angiopoietin-3 and angiopoietin-4 have very different distributions in their respective species, and angiopoietin-3 appears to act as an antagonist, whereas angiopoietin-4 appears to function as an agonist.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area project to the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens/olfactory tubercle, respectively, constituting mesostriatal and mesolimbic pathways. The molecular signals that confer target specificity of different dopaminergic neurons are not known. We now report that EphB1 and ephrin-B2, a receptor and ligand of the Eph family, are candidate guidance molecules for the development of these distinct pathways. EphB1 and ephrin-B2 are expressed in complementary patterns in the midbrain dopaminergic neurons and their targets, and the ligand specifically inhibits the growth of neurites and induces the cell loss of substantia nigra, but not ventral tegmental, dopaminergic neurons. These studies suggest that the ligand-receptor pair may contribute to the establishment of distinct neural pathways by selectively inhibiting the neurite outgrowth and cell survival of mistargeted neurons. In addition, we show that ephrin-B2 expression is upregulated by cocaine and amphetamine in adult mice, suggesting that ephrin-B2/EphB1 interaction may play a role in drug-induced plasticity in adults as well.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an atherogenic lipoprotein of unknown physiological function. The mechanism of Lp(a) atherogenicity as well as its catabolic pathways are only incompletely understood at present. In this report, we show that the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family member megalin/glycoprotein (gp) 330 is capable of binding and mediating the cellular uptake and degradation of Lp(a) in vitro. A mouse embryonic yolk sac cell line with native expression of megalin/gp330 but genetically deficient in LDLR-related protein (LRP) and a control cell line carrying a double knockout for both LRP and megalin/gp330 were compared with regard to their ability to bind, internalize, and degrade dioctadecyltetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI)-fluorescence-labeled Lp(a) as well as equimolar amounts of 125I-labeled Lp(a) and LDL. Uptake and degradation of radiolabeled Lp(a) by the megalin/gp330-expressing cells were, on average, 2-fold higher than that of control cells. This difference could be completely abolished by addition of the receptor-associated protein, an inhibitor of ligand binding to megalin/gp330. Mutual suppression of the uptake of 125I-Lp(a) and of 125I-LDL by both unlabeled Lp(a) and LDL suggested that Lp(a) uptake is mediated at least partially by apolipoprotein B100. Binding and uptake of DiI-Lp(a) resulted in strong signals on megalin/gp330-expressing cells versus background only on control cells. In addition, we show that purified megalin/gp330, immobilized on a sensor chip, directly binds Lp(a) in a Ca2+-dependent manner with an affinity similar to that for LDL.

       "  'Abstract': 'The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor (TNFR) gene superfamilies regulate diverse biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1] [2] [3]. We have identified a new TNF-related ligand, designated human GITR ligand (hGITRL), and its human receptor (hGITR), an ortholog of the recently discovered murine glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (mGITR) protein [4]. The hGITRL gene mapped to chromosome 1q23, near the gene for the TNF homolog Fas/CD95 ligand [5]. The hGITR gene mapped to chromosome 1p36, near a cluster of five genes encoding TNFR homologs [1] [6]. We found hGITRL mRNA in several peripheral tissues, and detected hGITRL protein on cultured vascular endothelial cells. The levels of hGITR mRNA in tissues were generally low; in peripheral blood T cells, however, antigen-receptor stimulation led to a substantial induction of hGITR transcripts. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in embryonic kidney 293 cells activated the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB, via a pathway that appeared to involve TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [7] and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) [8]. Cotransfection of hGITRL and hGITR in Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited antigen-receptor-induced cell death. Thus, hGITRL and hGITR may modulate T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Genetic analyses in Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrate that sel-12 and hop-1, homologues of the Alzheimer's disease-associated presenilin genes, modify signaling through LIN-12 and GLP-1, homologues of the Notch cell surface receptor. To gain insight into the biochemical basis of this genetic interaction, we tested the possibility that presenilin-1 (PS1) physically associates with the Notch1 receptor in mammalian cells. Notch1 and PS1 coimmunoprecipitated from transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cell lysates in a detergent-sensitive manner, consistent with a noncovalent physical association between the two proteins. The interaction predominantly occurred early in the secretory pathway prior to Notch cleavage in the Golgi, because PS1 immunoprecipitation preferentially recovered the full-length Notch1 precursor. When PS1 was immunoprecipitated from 293 cells that had been metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, Notch1 was the primary protein detected in PS1 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that this interaction is specific. Furthermore, endogenous Notch and presenilin coimmunoprecipitated from cultured Drosophila cells, indicating that physical interaction can occur at physiological expression levels. These results suggest that the genetic relationship between presenilins and the Notch signaling pathway derives from a direct physical association between these proteins in the secretory pathway.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediates the actions of a family of bioactive peptides that include epidermal growth factor (EGF) and amphiregulin (AR). Here we have studied AR and EGF mitogenic signaling in EGFR-devoid NR6 fibroblasts that ectopically express either wild type EGFR (WT) or a truncated EGFR that lacks the three major sites of autophosphorylation (c'1000). COOH-terminal truncation of the EGFR significantly impairs the ability of AR to (i) stimulate DNA synthesis, (ii) elicit Elk-1 transactivation, and (iii) generate sustained enzymatic activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. EGFR truncation had no significant effect on AR binding to receptor but did result in defective GRB2 adaptor function. In contrast, EGFR truncation did not impair EGF mitogenic signaling, and in c'1000 cells EGF was able to stimulate the association of ErbB2 with GRB2 and SHC. Elk-1 transactivation was monitored when either ErbB2 or a truncated dominant-negative ErbB2 mutant (ErbB2-(1-813)) was overexpressed in cells. Overexpression of full-length ErbB2 resulted in a strong constitutive transactivation of Elk-1 in c'1000 but only slightly stimulated Elk-1 in WT or parental NR6 cells. Conversely, overexpression of ErbB2-(1-813) inhibited EGF-stimulated Elk-1 transactivation in c'1000 but not in WT cells. Thus, the cytoplasmic tail of the EGFR plays a critical role in AR mitogenic signaling but is dispensable for EGF, since EGF-activated truncated EGFRs can signal through ErbB2.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) interacts with three types of PACAP/VIP-receptors. The PAC1-receptor accepts PACAP as a high affinity ligand but not vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) similarly binding to VPAC1- and VPAC2-receptors. To identify those amino acids not present in VIP defining PAC1-receptor selectivity of PACAP, radio receptor binding assays on AR4-2J cells were performed. It could be shown that PACAP(1-27) exhibited a distinct and much higher susceptibility to VIP-amino acid substitutions, compared to PACAP(1-38). Positions 4 and 5 seem to be most important for receptor binding of PACAP(1-27), whereas position 13 was identified to be crucial for maximal affinity of PACAP(1-38). PACAP(29-38) extension analogues of VIP revealed a stabilizing effect of the C-terminus of PACAP(1-38) on the optimal peptide conformation. The substitution analogues were also checked for their capacity to stimulate IP3 and cAMP formation in AR4-2J cells. Compared to PACAP(1-27) and PACAP(1-38), most analogues revealed potencies reduced congruously to their lower binding affinities. However, one of the analogues, PACAP(1-27) substituted in position 5, may represent a weak antagonist since this peptide was less potent in inducing second messengers than in label displacement. Our findings indicate that PACAP(1-27) and PACAP(1-38) differ in terms of their requirement of the amino acids in positions 4, 5, 9, 11 and 13 for maximal interaction with the PAC1-receptor.',\n",

We prepared an Fc chimeric molecule (F3IgFc) to identify molecules interacting with these domains and characterize the functional impact of the interactions. We affinity-isolated tenascin-C and isoforms of the proteoglycan-type protein tyrosine phosphatases zeta/beta (PTPzeta/RPTPbeta) from extracts of developing mouse brain. We showed that both PTPzeta/RPTPbeta and tenascin-C can bind directly to F3, possibly in an exclusive manner, with the highest affinity for the F3-PTPzeta/RPTPbeta interaction. We observed a strong binding of F3IgFc-coated fluorospheres to astrocytes in neural primary cultures and to C6 astrocytoma cells, and demonstrated, in antibody perturbation experiments, that F3-Ig binding on astrocytes depends on its interaction with PTPzeta/RPTPbeta. We also found by confocal analysis that tenascin-C and PTPzeta/RPTPbeta were colocalized on astrocytes which suggests a complex interplay of interactions between PTPzeta/RPTPbeta, tenascin-C and F3. We showed that the interaction between PTPzeta/RPTPbeta and F3-Ig-like domains can trigger bidirectional signalling. C6 glia-expressed PTPzeta/RPTPbeta stimulated neurite outgrowth by cortical and cerebellar neurons, whereas preclustered F3IgFc specifically modified the distribution of phosphotyrosine labelling in these glial cells. Both effects could be prevented and/or mimicked by anti-F3 and anti-6B4PG antibodies.

       "  'Abstract': 'Germ line mutations in one of two distinct genes, endoglin or ALK-1, cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant disorder of localized angiodysplasia. Both genes encode endothelial cell receptors for the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) ligand superfamily. Endoglin has homology to the type III receptor, betaglycan, although its exact role in TGF-beta signaling is unclear. Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1) has homology to the type I receptor family, but its ligand and corresponding type II receptor are unknown. In order to identify the ligand and type II receptor for ALK-1 and to investigate the role of endoglin in ALK-1 signaling, we devised a chimeric receptor signaling assay by exchanging the kinase domain of ALK-1 with either the TGF-beta type I receptor or the activin type IB receptor, both of which can activate an inducible PAI-1 promoter. We show that TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, as well as a third unknown ligand present in serum, can activate chimeric ALK-1. HHT-associated missense mutations in the ALK-1 extracellular domain abrogate signaling. The ALK-1/ligand interaction is mediated by the type II TGF-beta receptor for TGF-beta and most likely through the activin type II or type IIB receptors for the serum ligand. Endoglin is a bifunctional receptor partner since it can bind to ALK-1 as well as to type I TGF-beta receptor. These data suggest that HHT pathogenesis involves disruption of a complex network of positive and negative angiogenic factors, involving TGF-beta, a new unknown ligand, and their corresponding receptors.',\n",

Radioligand binding assays confirmed that the binding profiles of the recombinant receptors were similar to those of the native proteins. IL-8 displaced [125I]-IL-8 binding to CXCR1 and CXCR2 with pKi values of 8.89+/-0.05 and 9.27+/-0.03, respectively. GROalpha, a selective CXCR2 ligand, had a pKi value of 9.66+/-0.39 at CXCR2 but a pKi>8 at CXCR1. Calcium mobilization experiments were also consistent with previous reports on native receptors. Activation of both receptors resulted in stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. A comparison of the functional data at CXCRI showed that a similar potency order (IL-8> >GROalpha) was obtained in all three assays. However, at CXCR2 whilst the potency orders for calcium mobilization and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase were similar (IL-8 > or = GROalpha), the order was reversed for stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding (GROalpha > IL-8). All of the functional responses at both receptors were inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX), suggesting coupling to a Gi/Go protein. However, the calcium mobilization induced by IL-8 at CXCR1 was not fully inhibited by PTX, suggesting an interaction with a G-protein of the Gq family. Our results with pertussis toxin also suggested that, in the [35S]GTPgammaS binding assay, CXCR1 displays some constitutive activity. Thus, we have characterized the binding and several functional responses at HA-tagged CXCRs 1 and 2 and have shown that their pharmacology agrees well with that of the native receptors. We also have preliminary evidence that CXCR1 displays constitutive activity in our cell line and that CXCR2 may traffic between different PTX sensitive G-proteins.\",\n",

Experimental evidence indicates that SP and NKA modulate the activity of inflammatory and immune cells, including mononuclear ones. This study evaluated the effects of mammalian tachykinins and selective tachykinin agonists and antagonists on human monocytes isolated from healthy donors: SP, NKA and NKB all evoked a dose-dependent superoxide anion (O2-) production and the NK2 selective agonist [beta-Ala8]-NKA(4-10) induced a full response. The NK3 selective agonist senktide was inactive, while the NK1 selective agonists septide and [Sar9Met(O2)11]SP displayed some effects. These results indicate that NK2 and also some NK1 receptors are present in monocytes isolated from healthy donors. The role of tachykinin receptor activation in rheumatoid arthritis was also investigated, by measuring O2- production and TNF-alpha mRNA expression in monocytes isolated from rheumatoid patients. Tachykinins enhanced the expression of this cytokine in both control and rheumatoid monocytes and NK2 receptor stimulation was shown to trigger an enhanced respiratory burst in monocytes from rheumatoid patients. In conclusion, these results indicate that NK2 and NK1 receptors are present on human monocytes, the former being preferentially involved in rheumatoid arthritis.',\n",

One such KIR, denoted KIR2DL4, is structurally divergent from other KIRs in the configuration of its two extracellular Ig domains and of its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Here we show that recombinant soluble KIR2DL4 binds to cells expressing HLA-G but not to cells expressing other HLA class I molecules. Unlike other HLA class I-specific KIRs, which are clonally distributed on NK cells, KIR2DL4 is expressed at the surface of all NK cells. Furthermore, functional transfer of KIR2DL4 into the cell line NK-92 resulted in inhibition of lysis of target cells that express HLA-G, but not target cells that express other class I molecules including HLA-E. Therefore, given that HLA-G expression is restricted to fetal trophoblast cells, KIR2DL4 may provide important signals to maternal NK decidual cells that interact with trophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface during pregnancy.',\n",

These HLA-G tetramers failed to bind to NK cells and cells transfected with CD94/NKG2 and killer immunoglobulin-like NK receptors. In contrast, HLA-G tetramers did bind to peripheral blood monocytes, staining a CD16(+)CD14(mid) subset with greater intensity. On transfectants, HLA-G tetramers bound to inhibitory immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT)2 and ILT4 receptors. However, staining in the presence of antibodies reactive with ILT receptors revealed that the interaction of HLA-G tetramers with blood monocytes was largely due to binding to ILT4.

No angiotensin II responses are seen in wild-type CHO-K1 cells. 3.

Non-peptide selective AT1 antagonists inhibited the angiotensin II (0.1 microM) induced IP accumulation and the binding of [3H]-angiotensin II (1 nM) with the potency order: candesartan > EXP3174 > irbesartan > losartan. Their potencies are lower in the presence of bovine serum albumin. 5. Preincubation with the insurmountable antagonist candesartan decreased the maximal angiotensin II induced inositol phosphate accumulation up to 94% and, concomitantly, decreased the maximal binding capacity of the cell surface receptors. These inhibitory effects were half-maximal for 0.6 nM candesartan and were attenuated by simultaneous preincubation with 1 microM losartan indicating a syntopic action of both antagonists. 6. Losartan caused a parallel rightward shift of the angiotensin II concentration-response curves and did not affect the maximal binding capacity. EXP3174 (the active metabolite of losartan) and irbesartan showed a mixed-type behavior in both functional and binding studies. 7. Reversal of the inhibitory effect was slower for candesartan as compared with EXP3174 and irbesartan and it was almost instantaneous for losartan, suggesting that the insurmountable nature of selective AT1 receptor antagonists in functional studies was related to their long-lasting inhibition.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Glypican-1 is a member of a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans implicated in the control of cellular growth and differentiation. The 165-amino acid form of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) is a mitogen for endothelial cells and a potent angiogenic factor in vivo. Heparin binds to VEGF165 and enhances its binding to VEGF receptors. However, native HSPGs that bind VEGF165 and modulate its receptor binding have not been identified. Among the glypicans, glypican-1 is the only member that is expressed in the vascular system. We have therefore examined whether glypican-1 can interact with VEGF165. Glypican-1 from rat myoblasts binds specifically to VEGF165 but not to VEGF121. The binding has an apparent dissociation constant of 3 x 10(-10) M. The binding of glypican-1 to VEGF165 is mediated by the heparan sulfate chains of glypican-1, because heparinase treatment abolishes this interaction. Only an excess of heparin or heparan sulfates but not other types of glycosaminoglycans inhibited this interaction. VEGF165 interacts specifically not only with rat myoblast glypican-1 but also with human endothelial cell-derived glypican-1. The binding of 125I-VEGF165 to heparinase-treated human vascular endothelial cells is reduced following heparinase treatment, and addition of glypican-1 restores the binding. Glypican-1 also potentiates the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to a soluble extracellular domain of the VEGF receptor KDR/flk-1. Furthermore, we show that glypican-1 acts as an extracellular chaperone that can restore the receptor binding ability of VEGF165, which has been damaged by oxidation. Taken together, these results suggest that glypican-1 may play an important role in the control of angiogenesis by regulating the activity of VEGF165, a regulation that may be critical under conditions such as wound repair, in which oxidizing agents that can impair the activity of VEGF are produced, and in situations were the concentrations of active VEGF are limiting.',\n",

Binding to sulfated glycoconjugates mediates most high affinity binding of soluble TSP1 to MDA-MB-435 cells, but attachment and spreading of these cells on immobilized TSP1 is primarily beta1 integrin-dependent. The integrin alpha3beta1 is the major mediator of breast carcinoma cell adhesion and chemotaxis to TSP1. This integrin is partially active in MDA-MB-435 cells but is mostly inactive in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, which require beta1 integrin activation to induce spreading on TSP1. Integrin-mediated cell spreading on TSP1 is accompanied by extension of filopodia containing beta1 integrins. TSP1 binding activity of the alpha3beta1 integrin is not stimulated by CD47-binding peptides from TSP1 or by protein kinase C activation, which activate alphavbeta3 integrin function in the same cells. In MDA-MB-231 but not MDA-MB-435 cells, this integrin is activated by pertussis toxin, whereas serum, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and ligation of CD98 increase activity of this integrin in both cell lines. Serum stimulation is accompanied by increased surface expression of CD98, whereas insulin-like growth factor-1 does not increase CD98 expression. Thus, the pro-adhesive activity of TSP1 for breast carcinoma cells is controlled by several signals that regulate activity of the alpha3beta1 integrin.',\n",

The effect of CMP on the spreading of chondrocytes was synergistically increased by native, but not heated, type II collagen (gelatin). The monoclonal antibody to integrin alpha1 or beta1 abolished CMP-induced cell adhesion and spreading, whereas the antibody to integrin alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, beta2, alpha5beta1, or alphaVbeta5 had little effect on cell adhesion or spreading. The antibody to integrin alpha1, but not to other subunits, coprecipitated 125I-CMP that was added to MRC5 cell lysates, indicating the association of CMP with the integrin alpha1 subunit.

Lkn-1 cross-desensitized hMIP-1 alpha-induced calcium flux, but hMIP-1 alpha had little effect on the Lkn-1-induced response in human neutrophils. The same pattern was observed in peritoneal neutrophils from wild-type mice, whereas neutrophils from CCR1-/- mice failed to respond to either MIP-1 alpha or Lkn-1. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of receptor for both hMIP-1 alpha and Lkn-1 on human neutrophils with dissociation constants (Kd) of 3.2 nM and 1.1 nM, respectively. We conclude that CCR1 is a receptor mediating responses to both MIP-1 alpha and Lkn-1 on neutrophils and produces different biological responses depending on the ligand bound.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Signalling through the receptor protein Notch, which is involved in crucial cell-fate decisions during development, requires ligand-induced cleavage of Notch. This cleavage occurs within the predicted transmembrane domain, releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), and is reminiscent of gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), a critical event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A deficiency in presenilin-1 (PS1) inhibits processing of APP by gamma-secretase in mammalian cells, and genetic interactions between Notch and PS1 homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that the presenilins may modulate the Notch signalling pathway. Here we report that, in mammalian cells, PS1 deficiency also reduces the proteolytic release of NICD from a truncated Notch construct, thus identifying the specific biochemical step of the Notch signalling pathway that is affected by PS1. Moreover, several gamma-secretase inhibitors block this same step in Notch processing, indicating that related protease activities are responsible for cleavage within the predicted transmembrane domains of Notch and APP. Thus the targeting of gamma-secretase for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease may risk toxicity caused by reduced Notch signalling.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The integrin alpha9beta1 has been shown to be widely expressed on smooth muscle and epithelial cells, and to mediate adhesion to the extracellular matrix proteins osteopontin and tenascin-C. We have found that the peptide sequence this integrin recognizes in tenascin-C is highly homologous to the sequence recognized by the closely related integrin alpha4beta1, in the inducible endothelial ligand, vascular cell adhesion mole-cule-1 (VCAM-1). We therefore sought to determine whether alpha9beta1 also recognizes VCAM-1, and whether any such interaction would be biologically significant. In this report, we demonstrate that alpha9beta1 mediates stable cell adhesion to recombinant VCAM-1 and to VCAM-1 induced on human umbilical vein endothelial cells by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, we show that alpha9beta1 is highly and selectively expressed on neutrophils and is critical for neutrophil migration on VCAM-1 and tenascin-C. Finally, alpha9beta1 and alpha4 integrins contribute to neutrophil chemotaxis across activated endothelial monolayers. These observations suggest a possible role for alpha9beta1/VCAM-1 interactions in extravasation of neutrophils at sites of acute inflammation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Midkine is a 13-kDa heparin-binding growth factor with 45% sequence identity to pleiotrophin. Pleiotrophin has been demonstrated to bind to protein-tyrosine phosphatase zeta (PTPzeta) with high affinity. In this study, we examined the binding of midkine to PTPzeta by solid-phase binding assay. Midkine and pleiotrophin binding to PTPzeta were equally inhibited by soluble pleiotrophin and also by some specific glycosaminoglycans. For both bindings, Scatchard analysis revealed low (3.0 nM) and high (0.58 nM) affinity binding sites. These results suggested that PTPzeta is a common receptor for midkine and pleiotrophin. Midkine is structurally divided into the N- and C-terminal halves, and the latter exhibited full activity for PTPzeta binding and neuronal migration induction. The C-terminal half contains two heparin-binding sites consisting of clusters of basic amino acids, Clusters I and II. A mutation at Arg78 in Cluster I resulted in loss of the high affinity binding and reduced neuronal migration-inducing activity, while mutations at Lys83 and Lys84 in Cluster II showed almost no effect on either activity. Chondroitinase ABC-treated PTPzeta exhibited similar low affinity binding both to the native midkine and midkine mutants at Arg78. These results suggested that Arg78 in midkine plays an essential role in high affinity binding to PTPzeta by interacting with the chondroitin sulfate portion of this receptor.',\n",

Previous studies with defined combinations of ErbB receptors expressed in mammalian cells have helped elucidate specific biological responses for many of the recognized gene products that serve as ligands for these receptors.

To address this issue, the relative binding affinities of the egf domains of eleven ErbB ligands were measured on six ErbB receptor combinations using a soluble receptor-ligand binding format. The ErbB2/4 heterodimer was shown to bind all ligands tested with moderate to very high affinity. In contrast, ErbB3 showed much more restrictive ligand binding specificity and measurable binding was observed only with heregulin, neuregulin2beta, epiregulin and the synthetic heregulin/egf chimera, biregulin.

In E-cadherin-expressing EL cells, PRR was recruited to cadherin-based cell-cell AJs through interaction with afadin. PRR showed Ca2+-independent cell-cell adhesion activity.

Human TECK also induced the in vitro migration of HEK 293/human GPR-9-6 cells. These results confirm that GPR-9-6 is a specific receptor for TECK.

Viral IL-10 (vIL-10) is a homologue of human IL-10 (hIL-10) produced by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Both hIL-10 and vIL-10 bind to the soluble extracellular fragment of the cytokine receptor IL-10R1 (shIL-10R1). The stoichiometry of the vIL-10 : shIL-10R1 complex has been found to be the same as hIL-10 : shIL-10R1, with two vIL-10 dimers binding to four shIL-10R1 monomers. Complexes of both hIL-10 and vIL-10 with glycosylated shIL-10R1 could not be crystallized. Controlled deglycosylation using peptide : N-glycosidase F and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F3 resulted in the formation of crystals of both hIL-10 : shIL-10R1 and vIL-10 : shIL-10R1 complexes, indicating that the difficulty in the crystal formation was largely due to the presence of complex carbohydrate side chains.

       "  'Abstract': 'Chemokines and their receptors play a crucial part in the recruitment of leukocytes into inflammatory sites. The CXC chemokines IP-10 and Mig are selective attractants for activated (memory) T cells, the predominant cell type in skin infiltrates in many inflammatory dermatoses. The selectivity for activated T cells can be explained by the fact that both chemokines exert their effects through a common receptor, CXCR3, which is nearly exclusively expressed on activated T cells. The aim of this study was to identify biologically active CXCR3 ligands produced by keratinocytes. To that end, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a cDNA encoding CXCR3 were challenged with proteins obtained from interferon-gamma stimulated keratinocytes and subsequently monitored for effects on second messenger systems. By this approach we were able to isolate IP-10 and Mig, and in addition identified a novel highly potent ligand for the CXCR3 receptor, designated interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9, which proved to be chemotactic for activated T cells expressing CXCR3. Protein sequence and mass spectrometric analysis followed by molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9, revealed that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 is a CXC chemokine with a molecular mass of 8303 Da. From a GenBank database query it became clear that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 is in fact the protein encoded by the cDNA sequence also known as beta-R1, H174 or I-TAC. In situ hybridization experiments showed that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 mRNA is expressed by basal layer keratinocytes in a variety of skin disorders, including allergic contact dermatitis, lichen planus, and mycosis fungoides suggesting a functional role for this chemokine in skin immune responses.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The contribution of chemokines toward angiogenesis is currently a focus of intensive investigation. Certain members of the CXC chemokine family can induce bovine capillary endothelial cell migration in vitro and corneal angiogenesis in vivo, and apparently act via binding to their receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. We used an RNAse protection assay that permitted the simultaneous detection of mRNA for various CXC chemokine receptors in resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and detected low levels of only CXCR4 mRNA. Stimulation of HUVECs with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) up-regulated levels of only CXCR4 mRNA. CXCR4 specifically binds the chemokine stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha). Competitive binding studies using 125I-labeled SDF-1alpha with Scatchard analysis indicated that VEGF or bFGF induced an average number of approximately 16,600 CXCR4 molecules per endothelial cell, with a Kd = 1.23 x 10(-9) mol/L. These receptors were functional as HUVECs and human aorta endothelial cells (HAECs) migrated toward SDF-1alpha. Although SDF-1alpha-induced chemotaxis was inhibited by the addition of a neutralizing monoclonal CXCR4 antibody, endothelial chemotaxis toward VEGF was not altered; therefore, the angiogenic effect of VEGF is independent of SDF-1alpha. Furthermore, subcutaneous SDF-1alpha injections into mice induced formation of local small blood vessels that was accompanied by leukocytic infiltrates. To test whether these effects were dependent on circulating leukocytes, we successfully obtained SDF-1alpha-induced neovascularization from cross sections of leukocyte-free rat aorta. Taken together, our data indicate that SDF-1alpha acts as a potent chemoattractant for endothelial cells of different origins bearing CXCR4 and is a participant in angiogenesis that is regulated at the receptor level by VEGF and bFGF.',\n",

The open reading frame of TR6 encodes 300 amino acids with a 29-residue signal sequence but no transmembrane region. Using histidine-tagged recombinant TR6, we screened soluble forms of TNF-ligand proteins with immunoprecipitation.

These bindings were confirmed with HEK 293 EBNA cells transfected with LIGHT cDNA by flow cytometry. TR6 inhibited LIGHT-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. It has been shown that LIGHT triggers apoptosis of various tumor cells including HT29 cells that express both lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and HVEM/TR2 receptors.

Although previous studies have shown that AGRP binds three of the five known subtypes of melanocortin receptor, the receptor domains participating in binding and the molecular interactions involved are presently unknown. The present studies were designed to examine the contribution of extracytoplasmic domains of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) to AGRP binding by making chimerical receptor constructs of the human melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R; a receptor that is not inhibited by AGRP) and the human MC4R (a receptor that is potently inhibited by AGRP). Substitutions of the extracytoplasmic NH2 terminus and the first extracytoplasmic loop (exoloop) of the MC4R with homologous domains of the MC1R had no effect on AGRP (87-132) binding affinity or inhibitory activity (the ability to inhibit melanocortin-stimulated cAMP generation). In contrast, cassette substitutions of exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC4R with the homologous exoloops of the MC1R resulted in a substantial loss of AGRP binding affinity and inhibitory activity. Conversely, the exchange of exoloops 2 and 3 of the MC1R with the homologous exoloops of the MC4R was found to confer AGRP binding and inhibitory activity to the basic structure of the MC1R. Importantly, these substitutions did not affect the ability of the alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone analogue [Nle4,D-Phe7] melanocyte stimulating hormone to bind or activate the chimeric receptors. These data indicate that exoloops 2 and 3 of the melanocortin receptors are important for AGRP binding.',\n",

Substitution of Phe93 with alanine resulted in a dramatic decrease in EPO binding to the Escherichia coli-expressed extracellular domain of the EPOR (EPO-binding protein or EBP) and no detectable binding to full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Remarkably, Phe93 forms extensive contacts with a peptide ligand in the crystal structure of the EBP bound to an EPO-mimetic peptide (EMP1), suggesting that Phe93 is also important for EMP1 binding. We used alanine substitution of EBP residues that contact EMP1 in the crystal structure to investigate the function of these residues in both EMP1 and EPO binding. The three largest hydrophobic contacts at Phe93, Met150, and Phe205 and a hydrogen bonding interaction at Thr151 were examined. Our results indicate that Phe93 and Phe205 are important for both EPO and EMP1 binding, Met150 is not important for EPO binding but is critical for EMP1 binding, and Thr151 is not important for binding either ligand. Thus, Phe93 and Phe205 are important binding determinants for both EPO and EMP1, even though these ligands share no sequence or structural homology, suggesting that these residues may represent a minimum epitope on the EPOR for productive ligand binding.',\n",

Naturally occurring mutant forms of apo B may be a source of valuable information on these interactions. Apo B-70.5 is uniquely useful because it contains the NH2-terminal portion of apo B-100, that includes only one of the two putative LDL receptor-binding sites (site A). The lipoprotein containing apo B-70. 5 (Lp B-70.5) was purified from apo B-100/apo B-70.5 heterozygotes by sequential ultracentrifugation combined with immunoaffinity chromatography. Cell culture experiments, ligand blot analysis, and in vivo studies all consistently showed that Lp B-70.5 is not recognized by the LDL receptor.

Here we show that in contrast to heparin, cellular heparan sulfate forms a binary complex with FGFR that discriminates between FGF-1 and FGF-2. FGFR type 4 (FGFR4) in liver parenchymal cells binds only FGF-1, whereas FGFR1 binds FGF-1 and FGF-2 equally. Cell-free complexes of heparin and recombinant FGFR4 bound FGF-1 and FGF-2 equally. However, in contrast to FGFR1, when recombinant FGFR4 was expressed back in epithelial cells by transfection, it failed to bind FGF-2 unless heparan sulfate was depressed by chlorate or heparinase treatment. Isolated heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) from liver cells in cell-free complexes with FGFR4 restored the specificity for FGF-1 and supported the binding of both FGF-1 and FGF-2 when complexed with FGFR1. In contrast, FGF-2 bound equally well to complexes of both FGFR1 and FGFR4 formed with endothelial cell-derived HSPG, but the endothelial HSPG was deficient for the binding of FGF-1 to both FGFR complexes. These data suggest that a heparan sulfate subunit is a cell type- and FGFR-specific determinant of the selectivity of the FGFR signaling complex for FGF. In a physiological context, the heparan sulfate subunit may limit the redundancy among the current 18 FGF polypeptides for the 4 known FGFR.',\n",

The 25 kDa, non-glycosylated ifnar2-EC is a stable, fully active protein, which inhibits antiviral activity of IFNalpha2. The stoichiometry of binding IFNalpha2 is 1:1, as determined by gel filtration, chemical cross-linking and solid-phase detection. The affinity of this interaction is 10 nM, which is similar to the affinity measured for the cell surface-bound ifnar2 receptor. No difference in affinity was found throughout various assays using optical detection as BIAcore or reflectometric interference spectorscopy. However, the binding kinetics as measured in homogeneous phase by fluorescence de-quenching was about three times faster than that measured on a sensor surface. The rate of complex formation is relatively high compared to other cytokine-receptor interactions. The salt dependence of the association kinetics suggest a limited but significant contribution of electrostatic forces towards the rate of complex formation. The dissociation constant increases with decreasing pH according to the protonation of a base with a pKa of 6.7.

However, little direct evidence is available about which hormone subunits (alpha or beta) interact with which domains of the receptor. To determine whether the alpha-subunit contacts the exodomain of its receptor, hCG containing [125I]alpha and truncated exodomain lacking the endodomain were prepared. They were chemically cross-linked, and the resulting cross-linked complexes were solubilized and electrophoresed. The results indicate that the alpha-subunit of hCG was directly and specifically cross-linked to the exodomain. To verify the cross-linked exodomain by the independent method, the Flag epitope was inserted between the signal sequence and the mature exodomain. hCG containing [125I]alpha was cross-linked to the Flag exodomain, and the resulting cross-linked hCG/Flag exodomain complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. The results show that the material cross-linked to hCG containing [125I]alpha is indeed the exodomain. In conclusion, our results show the direct interaction of the alpha-subunit with the exodomain and, therefore, its crucial role in the hormone-receptor interaction in addition to its involvement in signal generation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Frizzled related proteins (FRPs) comprise a family of secreted molecules that contain an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) highly similar to the CRDs of the frizzled family of membrane-anchored Wnt receptors. FRPs have been shown to interact with Wnt proteins and antagonize Wnt signaling in a Xenopus developmental model. We demonstrated that FRP antagonizes the Wnt-induced increase in uncomplexed beta-catenin in both transient cotransfection and stable transformation models, where Wnt-induced morphological alterations are inhibited as well. We showed further that FRP inhibits Wnt signaling in a paracrine mode using a T-cell factor luciferase reporter to measure Wnt function. Investigation of the mechanisms responsible for FRP inhibition revealed that FRP forms complexes with WNT-1 or WNT-2 through its CRD domain. Transfection analysis with FRPs containing different tags revealed that FRP itself forms complexes and that this ability is conferred by its CRD domain. Finally, we demonstrated by cotransfection that FRP forms complexes with a prototype frizzled. All of these findings are consistent with a model by which FRP inhibits Wnt signaling through interactions with Wnt and/or formation of nonfunctional complexes with the frizzled receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The ErbB/HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases consists of four receptors that bind a large number of growth factor ligands sharing an epidermal growth factor- (EGF)-like motif. Whereas ErbB-1 binds seven different ligands whose prototype is EGF, the three families of neuregulins (NRGs) activate ErbB-3 and/or ErbB-4. Here we characterize a fourth neuregulin, NRG-4, that acts through ErbB-4. The predicted pro-NRG-4 is a transmembrane protein carrying a unique EGF-like motif and a short cytoplasmic domain. A synthetic peptide encompassing the full-length EGF-like domain can induce growth of interleukin-dependent cells ectopically expressing ErbB-4, but not cells expressing the other three ErbB proteins or their combinations. Consistent with specificity to ErbB-4, NRG-4 can displace an ErbB-4-bound NRG-1 and can activate signaling downstream of this receptor. Expression of NRG-4 mRNA was detected in the adult pancreas and weakly in muscle; other tissues displayed no detectable NRG-4 mRNA. The primary structure and the pattern of expression of NRG-4, together with the strict specificity of this growth factor to ErbB-4, suggest a physiological role distinct from that of the known ErbB ligands.',\n",

In resting cells the integrins are nonadhesive, but when activated they become adhesive for their ligands. Previous findings have shown that a peptide derived from the first Ig domain of ICAM-2 (P1) binds to LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) and Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) and activates leukocyte aggregation. Because its mechanism of action has remained poorly understood, we have now studied the peptide-induced ligand binding in detail. Here we show that P1 was able to induce CD11/CD18-dependent adhesion of human T lymphocytes to immobilized, purified ICAM-1, -2, and -3. The optimal peptide concentration was 150 micrograms/ml, whereas concentrations higher than 400 micrograms/ml did not have any stimulatory effect. The increase in adhesion was detectable within 10 min of treatment with the peptide; it was dependent on energy, divalent cations, temperature, and an intact cytoskeleton but was unaffected by protein kinase C and protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Peptide treatment resulted in strong stimulation of the binding of soluble, recombinant ICAMs to T lymphocytes, showing that the integrin affinity toward its ligands was increased. Importantly, soluble ICAM-2Fc was also able to induce T lymphocyte adhesion to purified ICAM-1, -2, and -3, and it was a more potent stimulatory molecule than ICAM-1Fc or ICAM-3Fc.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Melanocortin peptides regulate a variety of physiological processes. Five melanocortin receptors (MC-R) have been cloned and the MC3R and MC4R are the main brain MC receptors. The aim of this study was to identify structural requirements in both ligand and receptor that determine gamma-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) selectivity for the MC3R versus the MC4R. Substitution of Asp10 in [Nle4]Lys-gamma2-MSH for Gly10 from [Nle4]alpha-MSH, increased both activity and affinity for the MC4R while the MC3R remained unaffected. Analysis of chimeric MC3R/MC4Rs and mutant MC4Rs showed that Tyr268 of the MC4R mainly determined the low affinity for [Nle4]Lys-gamma2-MSH. The data demonstrate that Asp10 determines selectivity for the MC3R, however, not through direct side chain interactions, but probably by influencing how the melanocortin core sequence is presented to the receptor-binding pocket. This is supported by mutagenesis of Tyr268 to Ile in the MC4R which increased affinity and activity for [Nle4]Lys-gamma2-MSH, but decreased affinity for two peptides with constrained cyclic structure of the melanocortin core sequence, MT-II and [D-Tyr4]MT-II, that also displayed lower affinity for the MC3R. This study provides a general concept for peptide receptor selectivity, in which the major determinant for a selective receptor interaction is the conformational presentation of the core sequence in related peptides to the receptor-binding pocket.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) forms a tetrameric complex with its receptor, comprising two G-CSF and two receptor molecules. The structure of the complex is unknown, and it is unclear whether there are one or two binding sites on G-CSF and the receptor. The immunoglobulin-like domain and the cytokine receptor homologous module of the receptor are involved in G-CSF binding, and Arg288 in the cytokine receptor homologous module is particularly important. To identify residues in G-CSF that interact with Arg288, selected charged residues in G-CSF were mutated to Ala. To clarify whether there are two binding sites, a chimeric receptor was created in which the Ig domain was replaced with that of the related receptor gp130. This chimera bound G-CSF but could not transduce a signal, consistent with failure of dimerization and loss of one binding site. The G-CSF mutants had reduced mitogenic activity on cells expressing wild-type receptor. When tested with the chimeric receptor, all G-CSF mutants except one (E46A) showed reduced binding, suggesting that Glu46 is important for interaction with the Ig domain. On cells expressing R288A receptor, all the G-CSF mutants except E19A showed reduced mitogenic activity, indicating that Glu19 of G-CSF interacts with Arg288 of the receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Chemokines play diverse roles in inflammatory and non-inflammatory situations via activation of heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptors. Also, many chemokine receptors can act as cofactors for cellular entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro. CCR5, a receptor for chemokines MIP-1alpha (LD78alpha), MIP-1beta, RANTES, and MCP2, is of particular importance in vivo as polymorphisms in this gene affect HIV infection and rate of progression to AIDS. Moreover, the CCR5 ligands can prevent HIV entry through this receptor and likely contribute to the control of HIV infection. Here we show that a non-allelic isoform of human MIP-1alpha (LD78alpha), termed LD78beta or MIP-1alphaP, has enhanced receptor binding affinities to CCR5 (approximately 6-fold) and the promiscuous beta-chemokine receptor, D6 (approximately 15-20-fold). We demonstrate that a proline residue at position 2 of MIP-1alphaP is responsible for this enhanced activity. Moreover, MIP-1alphaP is by far the most potent natural CCR5 agonist described to date, and importantly, displays markedly higher HIV1 suppressive activity than all other human MIP-1alpha isoforms examined. In addition, while RANTES has been described as the most potent inhibitor of CCR5-mediated HIV entry, MIP-1alphaP was as potent as, if not more potent than, RANTES in HIV-1 suppressive assays. This property suggests that MIP-1alphaP may be of importance in controlling viral spread in HIV-infected individuals.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Using an affinity matrix in which a recombinant glypican-Fc fusion protein expressed in 293 cells was coupled to protein A-Sepharose, we have isolated from rat brain at least two proteins that were detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single 200-kDa silver-stained band, from which 16 partial peptide sequences were obtained by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Mouse expressed sequence tags containing two of these peptides were employed for oligonucleotide design and synthesis of probes by polymerase chain reaction and enabled us to isolate from a rat brain cDNA library a 4.1-kilobase clone that encoded two of our peptide sequences and represented the N-terminal portion of a protein containing a signal peptide and three leucine-rich repeats. Comparisons with recently published sequences also showed that our peptides were derived from proteins that are members of the Slit/MEGF protein family, which share a number of structural features such as N-terminal leucine-rich repeats and C-terminal epidermal growth factor-like motifs, and in Drosophila Slit is necessary for the development of midline glia and commissural axon pathways. All of the five known rat and human Slit proteins contain 1523-1534 amino acids, and our peptide sequences correspond best to those present in human Slit-1 and Slit-2. Binding of these ligands to the glypican-Fc fusion protein requires the presence of the heparan sulfate chains, but the interaction appears to be relatively specific for glypican-1 insofar as no other identified heparin-binding proteins were isolated using our affinity matrix. Northern analysis demonstrated the presence of two mRNA species of 8. 6 and 7.5 kilobase pairs using probes based on both N- and C-terminal sequences, and in situ hybridization histochemistry showed that these glypican-1 ligands are synthesized by neurons, such as hippocampal pyramidal cells and cerebellar granule cells, where we have previously also demonstrated glypican-1 mRNA and immunoreactivity. Our results therefore indicate that Slit family proteins are functional ligands of glypican-1 in nervous tissue and suggest that their interactions may be critical for certain stages of central nervous system histogenesis.',\n",

Two netrin genes, netrin-1 and netrin-2, have been described in chicken, but in mouse so far a single netrin gene, an ortholog of chick netrin-1, has been reported. We report the identification of a second mouse netrin gene, which we name netrin-3. Netrin-3 does not appear to be the ortholog of chick netrin-2 but is the ortholog of a recently identified human netrin gene termed NTN2L (\"netrin-2-like\"), as evidenced by a high degree of sequence conservation and by chromosomal localization. Netrin-3 is expressed in sensory ganglia, mesenchymal cells, and muscles during the time of peripheral nerve development but is largely excluded from the CNS at early stages of its development. The murine netrin-3 protein binds to netrin receptors of the DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) family [DCC and neogenin] and the UNC5 family (UNC5H1, UNC5H2 and UNC5H3). Unlike chick netrin-1, however, murine netrin-3 binds to DCC with lower affinity than to the other four receptors. Consistent with this finding, although murine netrin-3 can mimic the outgrowth-promoting activity of netrin-1 on commissural axons, it has lower specific activity than netrin-1. Thus, like netrin-1, netrin-3 may also function in axon guidance during development but may function predominantly in the development of the peripheral nervous system and may act primarily through netrin receptors other than DCC.',\n",

In the present study the association of ephrin-A cell surface ligands and EphA receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) with the organization of these compartments was determined in postnatal rats. Ephrin-A1 and ephrin-A4 selectively bind to EphA receptors on neurons restricted to the matrix compartment. Binding is absent from the striosomes, which were identified by mu-opioid receptor immunostaining. In contrast, ephrin-A2, ephrin-A3, and ephrin-A5 exhibit a different mosaic binding pattern that appears to define a subset of matrix neurons. In situ hybridization for EphA RTKs reveals that the two different ligand binding patterns strictly match the mRNA expression patterns of EphA4 and EphA7. Ligand-receptor binding assays indicate that ephrin-A1 and ephrin-A4 selectively bind EphA4 but not EphA7 in the lysates of striatal tissue. Conversely, ephrin-A2, ephrin-A3, and ephrin-A5 bind EphA7 but not EphA4.

The C-terminal sulphated octapeptide fragment of cholecystokinin (CCK8) constitutes one of the major neuropeptides in the brain; CCK8 has been shown to be involved in numerous physiological functions such as feeding behavior, central respiratory control and cardiovascular tonus, vigilance states, memory processes, nociception, emotional and motivational responses. CCK8 interacts with nanomolar affinities with two different receptors designated CCK-A and CCK-B.

The PTPase activity of the galectin-1 agarose binding membrane fraction could be inhibited by sodium orthovanadate. Preincubation of Jurkat T cell membrane preparations with galectin-1 decreased the membrane-associated PTPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubation of Jurkat cells with galectin-1 suppressed the immunoprecipitated PTPase activity of CD45. Galectin-1 stimulates the cell surface expression of phosphatidylserine an early indicator of apoptosis. In CD45+ Jurkat T cells, galectin-1 induces higher levels of phosphatidylserine when compared with CD45- Jurkat cells.

In radioligand binding assays, a range of ligands inhibited [125I]-Tyr14-NC binding in membranes from rCX and CHO(NCR) cells. As the peptide was truncated there was a general decline in pKi. [F/G]NC(1-13)NH2 was as potent as NC(1-13)NH2.

Recently it has been shown that L-selectin is involved not only in leukocyte tethering and rolling, but also plays an important role in leukocyte activation. For example, glycosylation-dependent cell-adhesion molecule 1 (GlyCAM-1), a known ligand for L-selectin, has been shown to enhance beta2-integrin function. GlyCAM-1 is a secreted protein and is present in mouse serum at a concentration of approx. 1.5 microg/ml. There is no obvious GlyCAM-1 homologue in man and, to date, L-selectin ligand(s) from human serum have not been characterized. Therefore we have used L-selectin affinity chromatography, followed by ion-exchange chromatography, to isolate specific ligand(s) for L-selectin. Using this procedure, we have isolated three major glycoproteins of apparent molecular masses 170 kDa, 70kDa and 50 kDa. The 170 kDa protein band was digested with trypsin and peptides were analysed by delayed extraction matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS and protein database searching. The 170 kDa protein was identified as the human complement protein Factor H. Human Factor H, isolated by a different method, was shown to bind specifically to L-selectin in the presence of CaCl2, and binding was inhibited by anti-L-selectin antibodies, fucoidan and lipopolysaccharide. Only a part of the purified Factor H preparation bound to immobilized L-selectin. The interaction of Factor H with leukocyte L-selectin was shown to induce the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Pretreatment of Factor H with sialidase reduced both the binding of L-selectin to Factor H and the Factor H-induced L-selectin-mediated TNF-alpha secretion by leukocytes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a post-translationally modified form of human plasma Factor H is a potential physiological ligand for L-selectin.',\n",

Addition of SCR3 to SCR(1-2) significantly improved potency, whereas the addition of SCR4 conferred no additional benefit. This observation, coupled with the ability of the single-domain SCR3 to inhibit classical pathway mediated lysis with an IH50% (inhibition of hemolysis by 50%) of 4.8 microM, demonstrates that SCR3 provides key binding interactions with activated complement components. SCR(1-3) was able to inhibit both classical and alternative pathways of complement activation, showing that the N-terminal SCR of CR1 retain the ability to interact with C3b. Assays for CR1-like cofactor activity for factor I using C4b-like C4 or C3b-like C3 as substrates showed that SCR(1-3) possessed such cofactor activity and that C4b-like C4 was a better substrate. When compared to full-length (30 SCR) soluble CR1 (sCR1), SCR(1-3) was significantly less potent in accord with a model involving multi-valent binding of C3b/C4b to CR1.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Multiple amylin receptors arise from receptor activity-modifying protein interaction with the calcitonin receptor gene product.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) are single-transmembrane proteins that transport the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) to the cell surface. RAMP 1-transported CRLR is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor. RAMP 2- or RAMP 3-transported CRLR is an adrenomedullin receptor. The role of RAMPs beyond their interaction with CRLR, a class II G protein-coupled receptor, is unclear. In this study, we have examined the role of RAMPs in generating amylin receptor phenotypes from the calcitonin (CT) receptor gene product. Cotransfection of RAMP 1 or RAMP 3 with the human CT receptor lacking the 16-amino acid insert in intracellular domain 1 (hCTRI1-) into COS-7 cells induced specific 125I-labeled rat amylin binding. RAMP 2 or vector cotransfection did not cause significant increases in specific amylin binding. Competition-binding characterization of the RAMP-induced amylin receptors revealed two distinct phenotypes. The RAMP 1-derived amylin receptor demonstrated the highest affinity for salmon CT (IC50, 3.01 +/- 1.44 x 10(-10) M), a high to moderate affinity for rat amylin (IC50, 7.86 +/- 4.49 x 10(-9) M) and human CGRPalpha (IC50, 2.09 +/- 1.63 x 10(-8) M), and a low affinity for human CT (IC50, 4.47 +/- 0.78 x 10(-7) M). In contrast, whereas affinities for amylin and the CTs were similar for the RAMP 3-derived receptor, the efficacy of human CGRPalpha was markedly reduced (IC50, 1.12 +/- 0.45 x 10(-7) M; P <.05 versus RAMP 1). Functional cyclic AMP responses in COS-7 cells cotransfected with individual RAMPs and hCTRI1- were reflective of the phenotypes seen in competition for amylin binding. Confocal microscopic localization of c-myc-tagged RAMP 1 indicated that, when transfected alone, RAMP 1 almost exclusively was located intracellularly. Cotransfection with calcitonin receptor (CTR)I1- induced cell surface expression of RAMP 1. The results of experiments cross-linking 125I-labeled amylin to RAMP 1/hCTR-transfected cells with bis succidimidyl suberate were suggestive of a cell-surface association of RAMP 1 and the receptors. Our data suggest that in the CT family of receptors, and potentially in other class II G protein-coupled receptors, the cellular phenotype is likely to be dynamic in regard to the level and combination of both the receptor and the RAMP proteins.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Interleukin 7 (IL-7) is a stromal cell-derived cytokine that stands out as being the only cytokine identified to date on which development of B and T lymphocytes is absolutely dependent. IL-7 functions primarily as a growth and antiapoptosis factor for B- and T-cell (alphabeta and gammadelta TCR+ cells) precursors, and is essential for differentiation of gammadelta TCR+ cells. IL-7 can function as a cofactor during myelopoiesis, and is capable of activating monocytes/macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. Its receptor (IL-7R) is a heterodimer of an alpha chain that specifically binds IL-7 and the common gamma chain gammac that is also a component of the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-9 and IL-15. The functions of IL-7 in normal lymphocyte development and activation have led to the demonstration of the ability of IL-7 to stimulate lymphopoiesis in lymphopenic mice, suggesting a possible clinical application of IL-7 in accelerating lymphoid reconstitution in lymphopenic patients. There have also been a number of preclinical studies pointing to the possible utility of IL-7 in antitumor clinical applications, and clinical trials involving IL-7 gene therapy of metastatic disease are underway. IL-7 has also been shown to promote engraftment of stem cells in mice receiving bone marrow transplants, pointing to a possible use of IL-7 in patients receiving bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants. Areas of IL-7 biology that are essentially unexplored include the mechanisms of regulation of the expression of IL-7 and IL-7Ralpha, as well as the mechanisms by which IL-7 is a growth and differentiation factor for gammadelta T cells but a growth factor only for alphabeta T cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have previously reported that synthetic peptide amides corresponding to subdomains of the human FSH 3-subunit, hFSH-beta-(33--53) and hFSH-beta-(81--95), interact with the external domain of the FSH receptor in two in vitro model systems. Consistent with these in vitro observations, we found that intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of each of these peptides prolonged vaginal estrus in normally cycling mice in vivo. Both hFSH-beta-(33--53) and hFSH-beta-(81--95) contain cysteine (Cys) residues with free sulfhydryl groups of potential significance in receptor interactions. To assess the possible involvement of these groups in the in vivo effects of hFSH-beta-(33--53) and hFSH-beta-(81--95), synthetic peptide analogs were prepared in which all Cys residues were replaced with serine (Ser). In the present study, we demonstrate that the in vivo effect of hFSH-beta-(33--53) on the mouse estrous cycle, extension of vaginal estrus, was not changed by substitution of Cys-51 with Ser. In contrast, mice receiving the Ser-substituted analog of hFSH-beta-(81--95) had normal estrus stages, but were arrested in diestrus. hFSH-beta-(33--53)-(81--95), a linear peptide encompassing both domains, also prolonged vaginal estrus. The Ser-substituted analog of this peptide, however, prolonged vaginal estrus in some of the mice tested and induced cycle arrest at diestrus in others. hFSH-beta-(90--95), the active subdomain at the C-terminus of hFSH-beta-(81--95), extended vaginal estrus, but diestrus stages were of normal duration. Its Ser-substituted analog, however, prolonged the estrus stage of the majority of mice treated, but induced diestrus arrest in some. The differing responses to these peptides are presumably due to interactions of the synthetic peptides with different regions of the FSH receptor. This further suggests that one consequence of ligand interaction with multiple receptor binding domains may be variable effects on ovarian function, and that Cys to Ser analogs may have value in the design of a novel class of synthetic peptides capable of fertility regulation and control.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The human IFN-alpha receptor (hIFNAR) is a complex composed of at least two chains, hIFNAR1 and hIFNAR2. We have performed a structure-function analysis of hIFNAR2 extracellular domain regions using anti-hIFNAR2 mAbs (1D3, 1F3, and 3B7) and several type I human IFNs. These mAbs block receptor activation, as determined by IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 formation, and block the antiviral cytopathic effects induced by type I IFNs. We generated alanine substitution mutants of hIFNAR2-IgG and determined that regions of hIFNAR2 are important for the binding of these blocking mAbs and hIFN-alpha2/alpha1. We further demonstrated that residues E78, W101, I104, and D105 are crucial for the binding of hIFN-alpha2/alpha1 and form a defined protrusion when these residues are mapped upon a structural model of hIFNAR2. To confirm that residues important for ligand binding are indeed important for IFN signal transduction, we determined the ability of mouse L929 cells expressing hIFNAR2 extracellular domain mutants to mediate hIFN signal. hIFN-alpha8, previously shown to signal a response in L929 cells expressing hIFNAR1, was unable to signal in L929 cells expressing hIFNAR2. Transfected cells expressing hIFNAR2 containing mutations at residues E78, W101, I104, or D105 were unresponsive to hIFN-alpha2, but remained responsive to hIFN-beta. In summary, we have identified specific residues of hIFNAR2 important for the binding to hIFN-alpha2/1 and demonstrate that specific regions of the IFNAR interact with the subspecies of type I IFN in different manners.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Integrin-associated protein (IAP; or CD47) is a receptor for the cell binding domain (CBD) of thrombospondin-1 (TS1). In platelets, IAP associates with and regulates the function of alphaIIbbeta3 integrin (Chung et al, J Biol Chem 272:14740, 1997). We test here the possibility that CD47 may also modulate the function of platelet integrin alpha2beta1, a collagen receptor. The CD47 agonist peptide, 4N1K (KRFYVVMWKK), derived from the CBD, synergizes with soluble collagen in aggregating platelet-rich plasma. 4N1K and intact TS1 also induce the aggregation of washed, unstirred platelets on immobilized collagen with a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. The effects of TS1 and 4N1K on platelet aggregation are absolutely dependent on IAP, as shown by the use of platelets from IAP-/- mice. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) prevents 4N1K-dependent aggregation on immobilized collagen but does not inhibit the 4N1K peptide stimulation of alpha2beta1-dependent platelet spreading. Finally, a detergent-stable, physical association of IAP and alpha2beta1 integrin is detected by coimmunoprecipitation. These results imply a role for IAP and TS1 in the early activation of platelets upon adhesion to collagen.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Netrins are bifunctional: they attract some axons and repel others. Netrin receptors of the Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) family are implicated in attraction and those of the UNC5 family in repulsion, but genetic evidence also suggests involvement of the DCC protein UNC-40 in some cases of repulsion. To test whether these proteins form a receptor complex for repulsion, we studied the attractive responses of Xenopus spinal axons to netrin-1, which are mediated by DCC. We show that attraction is converted to repulsion by expression of UNC5 proteins in these cells, that this repulsion requires DCC function, that the UNC5 cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to effect the conversion, and that repulsion can be initiated by netrin-1 binding to either UNC5 or DCC. The isolated cytoplasmic domains of DCC and UNC5 proteins interact directly, but this interaction is repressed in the context of the full-length proteins. We provide evidence that netrin-1 triggers the formation of a receptor complex of DCC and UNC5 proteins and simultaneously derepresses the interaction between their cytoplasmic domains, thereby converting DCC-mediated attraction to UNC5/DCC-mediated repulsion.',\n",

Here we report on the identification of Arg-336 and Asn-333 of CCK-AR, which interact with the Asp-8 carboxylate and the C-terminal amide of CCK-9, respectively. Identification of the two amino acids was achieved by dynamics-based docking of CCK in a refined three-dimensional model of CCK-AR using, as constraints, previous results that demonstrated that Trp-39/Gln-40 and Met-195/Arg-197 interact with the N terminus and the sulfated tyrosine of CCK, respectively. Arg-336-Asp-8 and Asn-333-amide interactions were pharmacologically assessed by mutational exchange of Arg-336 and Asn-333 in the receptor or reciprocal elimination of the partner chemical functions in CCK.

The two splice isoforms, VEGF-B(167) and VEGF-B(186), have identical NH(2)-terminal cystine knot growth factor domains but differ in their COOH-terminal domains which give these forms their distinct biochemical properties. In this study, we show that both splice isoforms of VEGF-B bind specifically to Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a receptor for collapsins/semaphorins and for the VEGF(165) isoform. The NRP1 binding of VEGF-B could be competed by an excess of VEGF(165). The binding of VEGF-B(167) was mediated by the heparin binding domain, whereas the binding of VEGF-B(186) to NRP1 was regulated by exposure of a short COOH-terminal proline-rich peptide upon its proteolytic processing. In immunohistochemistry, NRP1 distribution was found to be overlapping or adjacent to known sites of VEGF-B expression in several tissues, in particular in the developing heart, suggesting the involvement of VEGF-B in NRP1-mediated signaling.',\n",

One such molecule is vMIP-I, a C-C type chemokine of undefined function and binding specificity, encoded by the Kaposi\\'s sarcoma herpesvirus HHV-8. We report here that vMIP-I binds to and induces cytosolic [Ca(2+)] signals in human T cells selectively through CCR8, a CC chemokine receptor associated with Th2 lymphocytes. Furthermore, using a panel of 65 different human, viral, and rodent chemokines, we have established a comprehensive ligand binding \"fingerprint\" for CCR8. The receptor exhibits marked \"high\" affinity (K(d) < 15 nM) only for four chemokines, three of them of viral origin: vMIP-I, vMIP-II, vMCC-I, and human I-309. A previously unreported second class of lower affinity ligands includes MCP-3 and possibly two other viral chemokines. vMIP-I and I-309 appear to act as CCR8 agonists: binding to and inducing cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation through the receptor. By contrast, vMIP-II and vMCC-I act as potent antagonists: binding without inducing signaling, and blocking the effects of I-309 and vMIP-I. These results suggest a ligand hierarchy for CCR8, identifying vMIP-I as a selective viral chemokine agonist. CCR8 may thus engage a specific subset of chemokines with the potential to regulate each other during viral infection and immune regulation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The underlying causes of obesity are poorly understood but probably involve complex interactions between many neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems involved in the regulation of food intake and energy balance. Three pieces of evidence indicate that the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an important component of this system. First, MCH stimulates feeding when injected directly into rat brains; second, the messenger RNA for the MCH precursor is upregulated in the hypothalamus of genetically obese mice and in fasted animals; and third, mice lacking MCH eat less and are lean. MCH antagonists might, therefore, provide a treatment for obesity. However, the development of such molecules has been hampered because the identity of the MCH receptor has been unknown until now. Here we show that the 353-amino-acid human orphan G-protein-coupled receptor SLC-1 expressed in HEK293 cells binds MCH with sub-nanomolar affinity, and is stimulated by MCH to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and reduce forskolin-elevated cyclic AMP levels. We also show that SLC-1 messenger RNA and protein is expressed in the ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, consistent with a role for SLC-1 in mediating the effects of MCH on feeding.',\n",

In this study we examined the ability of HRG to regulate the binding of monomeric IgG and IC to monocytes. Initial studies demonstrated that HRG interacts with FcgammaRI on the monocytic cell line THP1 and blocks the binding of monomeric IgG to these cells. However, despite totally blocking the binding of monomeric IgG to FcgammaRI, pre-incubation of THP1 cells with HRG had no effect on the binding of IC to these cells. In contrast, depending on the HRG:IgG molar ratio, pre-incubation of monomeric IgG with HRG resulted in either enhanced or reduced IgG binding to FcgammaRI. Similarly, under certain highly defined conditions, incorporation of HRG in IgG-containing IC potentiated the binding of IC to THP1 cells. The key conditions involved incorporating approximately equimolar concentrations of HRG and IgG in the IC, the IC being formed at a near equivalence antigen:antibody ratio and usually physiological concentration (20 microM) of Zn(2+) being present. Collectively these observations indicate that HRG is an important regulator of IC uptake by monocytes. Thus HRG can interact with FcgammaRI on monocytes and block monomeric IgG binding, whereas when incorporated in IgG containing IC, HRG can enhance the uptake of IC by monocytes, probably via its heparan sulfate binding domain.',\n",

The screening of L-alanine-modified CCK peptides to bind and activate the wild type and mutant receptors allowed the identification of the interaction of the C-terminal Asp(8) of CCK with His(207). The H207A-CCKBR mutant, unlike the wild type receptor, was insensitive to substitution of Asp(8) of CCK to other amino acid residues. This interaction was further confirmed by mutating His(207) to Asp. The affinity of CCK for the H207D-CCKBR mutant was 100-fold lower than for the H207A-CCKBR mutant, consistent with an electrostatic repulsion between the negative charges of the two interacting aspartic acids. Peptides with neutral amino acids in position eight of CCK reversed this effect and displayed a gain of affinity for the H207D mutant compared with CCK. To date, this is the first report concerning the identification of a direct contact point between the CCKB receptor and CCK.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Kell blood group protein shares a consensus sequence (H.E.X.X.H) with a large family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases. Kell has closest homology with neutral endopeptidase 24.11, endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), and the PEX gene product that, as a group, comprise the M13 subfamily of mammalian neutral endopeptidases. The proteolytic activity of the M13 members, but not of Kell, has been previously demonstrated. A secreted form of wild-type Kell protein (s-Kell), devoid of the intracellular and transmembrane domains, was expressed in sf9 cells. As a negative control, an inactive mutant Kell protein (E582G) was expressed. As determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry of the cleaved products, wild-type s-Kell, but not the control mutant protein, specifically cleaved big endothelin-3 (ET-3) at Trp(21)-Ile(22), yielding ET-3, and, to a much lesser extent, also cleaved big ET-1 and big ET-2 at Trp(21)-Val(22), yielding ET-1 and ET-2. Enzymatic activity was partially inhibited by phosphoramidon. s-Kell has an acidic pH optimum (pH 6.0 to 6.5). Like the recombinant protein, red blood cells of common Kell phenotype also preferentially process big ET-3, in contrast to Ko (null) cells that do not. These data demonstrate that the Kell blood group protein is a proteolytic enzyme that processes big ET-3, generating ET-3, a potent bioactive peptide with multiple biological roles.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The trafficking of leukocytes through tissues is supported by an interaction between the beta 2 (CD18) integrins CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) and CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) and their ligand ICAM-1. The most recently identified and fourth member of the beta 2 integrins, alpha D beta 2, selectively binds ICAM-3 and does not appear to bind ICAM-1. We have reported recently that alpha D beta 2 can support eosinophil adhesion to VCAM-1. Here we demonstrate that expression of alpha D beta 2 in a lymphoid cell that does not express alpha 4 integrins confers efficient binding to VCAM-1. In addition, a soluble form of alpha D beta 2 binds VCAM-1 with greater efficiency relative to ICAM-3. The I domain of alpha D contains a binding site for VCAM-1 since recombinant alpha D I domain binds specifically to VCAM-1. In addition, alpha D mAb that block cellular binding to VCAM-1 bind the alpha D I domain. Using VCAM-1 mutants we have determined that the binding site on VCAM-1 for alpha D beta 2 overlaps with that of alpha 4++ integrins. Substitution of VCAM-1 aspartate at position 40, D40, within the conserved integrin binding site, diminishes binding to alpha D beta 2 and abrogates binding to the alpha D I domain. The corresponding integrin binding site residue in ICAM-3 is also essential to alpha D beta 2 binding. Finally, we demonstrate that alpha D beta 2 can support lymphoid cell adhesion to VCAM-1 under flow conditions at levels equivalent to those mediated by alpha 4 beta 1. These results indicate that VCAM-1 can bind to an I domain and that the binding of alpha D beta 2 to VCAM-1 may contribute to the trafficking of a subpopulation of leukocytes that express alpha D beta 2.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Human CG (hCG) consists of a common alpha-subunit and a hormone-specific beta-subunit. Similarly, its receptor is also composed of two domains, an extracellular N-terminal half (exodomain) and a membrane-associated C-terminal half (endodomain). hCG initially binds the exodomain of the receptor after which the resulting hCG/exodomain complex is thought to interact with the endodomain. This secondary interaction is considered responsible for signal generation. Despite the importance, it is unclear which hormone subunit interacts with the exodomain or the endodomain. As a step to determine the mechanisms of the initial and secondary interactions and signal generation, we investigated the interaction of the hormone-specific beta-subunit in hCG with the receptor's exodomain. A photoactivable hCG derivative consisting of the wild-type alpha-subunit and a photoactivable beta-subunit derivative was prepared and used to label the exodomain. The analysis and immunoprecipitation of photoaffinity labeled exodomain demonstrate that the beta-subunit in hCG makes the direct contact with the exodomain.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The mammalian peptide neuromedin B (NMB) and its receptor are expressed in a variety of tissues; however, little is definitively established about its physiological actions because of the lack of potent, specific antagonists. Recently, the peptoid PD 168368 was found to be a potent human NMB receptor antagonist. Because it had been shown previously that either synthetic analogs of bombesin (Bn) or other receptor peptoid or receptor antagonists function as an antagonist or agonist depends on animal species and receptor subtype studied, we investigated the pharmacological properties of PD 168368 compared with all currently known Bn receptor subtypes (NMB receptor, gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, Bn receptor subtype 3, and Bn receptor subtype 4) from human, mouse, rat, and frog. In binding studies, PD 168368 had similar high affinities (K(i) = 15-45 nM) for NMB receptors from each species examined, 30- to 60-fold lower affinity for gastrin-releasing peptide receptors, and >300-fold lower affinity for Bn receptor subtype 3 or 4. It inhibited NMB binding in a competitive manner. PD 168368 alone did not stimulate increases in either intracellular calcium concentration or [(3)H]inositol phosphates in any of the cells studied but inhibited NMB-induced responses with equivalent potencies in cells containing NMB receptors. PD 168368 was only minimally soluble in water. When hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin rather than dimethyl sulfoxide was used as the vehicle, both the affinity and the antagonist potency of PD 168368 were significantly greater. The results demonstrate that PD 168368 is a potent, competitive, and selective antagonist at NMB receptors, with a similar pharmacology across animal species. PD 168368 should prove useful for delineating the biological role of NMB and selectively blocking NMB signaling in bioassays and as a lead for the development of more selective nonpeptide antagonists for the NMB receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We previously identified a novel integrin alpha-chain in human fetal muscle cells (Gullberg, D., Velling, T., SjÃ¶berg, G., and Sejersen, T. (1995) Dev. Dyn. 204, 57-65). We have now isolated the full-length cDNA for this integrin subunit, alpha(11). The open reading frame of the cDNA encodes a precursor of 1188 amino acids. The predicted mature protein of 1166 amino acids contains seven conserved FG-GAP repeats, an I domain with a metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif, a short transmembrane region, and a unique cytoplasmic domain of 24 amino acids containing the sequence GFFRS. alpha(11), like other I domain integrins, lacks a dibasic cleavage site for generation of a heavy chain and a light chain, and it contains three potential divalent cation binding sites in repeats 5-7. The presence of 22 inserted amino acids in the extracellular stalk portion (amino acids 804-826) distinguishes the alpha(11) integrin sequence from other integrin alpha-chains. Amino acid sequence comparisons reveal the highest identity of 42% with the alpha(10) integrin chain. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to alpha(11) integrin captures a 145-kDa protein distinctly larger than the 140-kDa alpha(2) integrin chain when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Fluorescence in situ hybridization maps the integrin alpha(11) gene to chromosome 15q23, in the vicinity of an identified locus for Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Based on Northern blotting, integrin alpha(11) mRNA levels are high in the adult human uterus and in the heart and intermediate in skeletal muscle and some other tissues tested. During in vitro myogenic differentiation, alpha(11) mRNA and protein are up-regulated. Studies of ligand binding properties show that alpha(11)beta(1) binds collagen type I-Sepharose, and cultured muscle cells localize alpha(11)beta(1) into focal contacts on collagen type I. Future studies will reveal the importance of alpha(11)beta(1) for muscle development and integrity in adult muscle and other tissues.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"CD 73 (5'-nucleotidase) is an ectoenzyme, which is expressed on normal and neoplastic glial plasma membranes. The enzyme binds to intracellular filamentous actin and the extracellular matrix proteins laminin and fibronectin. CD 73 is a signalling pathway metabolite in the immune response of lymphocytes. The ectoenzyme catalyzes the conversion of purine and pyrimidine ribo- and deoxyribo-nucleoside monophosphates (AMP, GMP, IMP) and leads to elevation of the corresponding nucleosides (adenosine) in the extracellular space and might therefore modulate neuronal signalling and vascular perfusion. CD 73 has also been called a cellular motility factor. There is an increasing amount of evidence for the modulatory role of PKC-mediated CD 73 activity in ischemia, regeneration and repair, glioma cell proliferation and a possible invasion promoting feature of the ectoenzyme. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression patterns of CD 73 together with the labelling of PKC and EGFR. The latter is known as a marker for primary glioblastomas.\",\n",

A strong inward current was observed with crude rat brain extracts which upon further purification by cation exchange chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) yielded two peptides with a high agonist activity. Mass spectrometry and partial peptide sequencing revealed that one peptide is identical with the neuropeptide melanin concentrating hormone (MCH), the other represents a truncated version of MCH lacking the three N-terminal amino acid residues. Xenopus oocytes expressing the MCH receptor responded to nM concentrations of synthetic MCH not only by the activation of GIRK-mediated currents but also by the induction of Ca(2+) dependent chloride currents mediated by phospholipase C. This indicates that the MCH receptor can couple either to the G(i)- or G(q)-mediated signal transduction pathway, suggesting that MCH may serve for a number of distinct brain functions including food uptake behavior.',\n",

The recent progress in cDNA and genome DNA analyses has brought the discovery of numerous genes encoding ligand-unknown \"orphan\" 7TMRs. We have developed a strategy to identify the ligands of orphan 7TMRs by monitoring specific signal transductions induced in cells expressing orphan 7TMRs. Employing this method, we succeeded in identifying the natural ligands of the orphan 7TMRs, hGR3, and APJ. The ligand peptide identified for hGR3 was found to show a specific prolactin release promoting activity in rat anterior pituitary cells in in vitro culture and was therefore named \"prolactin-releasing peptide.\" We named another novel bioactive peptide \"apelin,\" for \"APJ endogenous ligand.\" Although the biological functions of apelin are still under investigation, APJ reportedly acts as a coreceptor in the process of human immunodeficiency virus infection. We believe that the identification of orphan 7TMR ligands will provide clues to reveal the unknown regulatory mechanisms of various physiological phenomena and opportunities for novel drug discovery in the future.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CCR5 was first characterized as a receptor for MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES, and was rapidly shown to be the main coreceptor for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Chemokines constitute a rapidly growing family of proteins and receptor-chemokine interactions are known to be promiscuous and redundant. We have therefore tested whether other CC-chemokines could bind to and activate CCR5. All CC-chemokines currently available were tested for their ability to compete with [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding on a stable cell line expressing recombinant CCR5, and/or to induce a functional response in these cells. We found that in addition to MIP-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, five other CC-chemokines could compete for [(125)I]-MIP-1beta binding: MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-1, and eotaxin binding was characterized by IC(50) values of 0.22, 2.14, 5.89, 29.9, and 21.7 nmol/L, respectively. Among these ligands, MCP-3 had the remarkable property of binding CCR5 with high affinity without eliciting a functional response, MCP-3 could also inhibit the activation of CCR5 by MIP-1beta and may therefore be considered as a natural antagonist for CCR5. It was unable to induce significant endocytosis of the receptor. Chemokines that could compete with high affinity for MIP-1beta binding could also compete for monomeric gp120 binding, although with variable potencies; maximal gp120 binding inhibition was 80% for MCP-2, but only 30% for MIP-1beta. MCP-3 could compete efficiently for gp120 binding but was, however, found to be a weak inhibitor of HIV infection, probably as a consequence of its inability to downregulate the receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Interleukin (IL)-16 is a proinflammatory cytokine that has attracted widespread attention because of its ability to block HIV replication. We describe the identification and characterization of a large neuronal IL-16 precursor, NIL-16. The N-terminal half of NIL-16 constitutes a novel PDZ domain protein sequence, whereas the C terminus is identical with splenocyte-derived mouse pro-IL-16. IL-16 has been characterized only in the immune system, and the identification of NIL-16 marks a previously unsuspected connection between the immune and the nervous systems. NIL-16 is a cytosolic protein that is detected only in neurons of the cerebellum and the hippocampus. The N-terminal portion of NIL-16 interacts selectively with a variety of neuronal ion channels, which is similar to the function of many other PDZ domain proteins that serve as intracellular scaffolding proteins. Among the NIL-16-interacting proteins is the class C alpha1 subunit of a mouse brain calcium channel (mbC alpha1). The C terminus of NIL-16 can be processed by caspase-3, resulting in the release of secreted IL-16. Furthermore, in cultured cerebellar granule neurons undergoing apoptosis, NIL-16 proteolysis parallels caspase-3 activation. Cerebellar granule neurons express the IL-16 receptor CD4. Exposure of these cells to IL-16 induces expression of the immediate-early gene, c-fos, via a signaling pathway that involves tyrosine phosphorylation. This suggests that IL-16 provides an autocrine function in the brain. Therefore, we hypothesize that NIL-16 is a dual function protein in the nervous system that serves as a secreted signaling molecule as well as a scaffolding protein.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-beta1) is secreted by cells in a latent form (L-TGF-beta1) noncovalently bound to a latency-associated peptide. Activated alveolar macrophages obtained from rat lungs after bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury released increased amounts of active TGF-beta1 as well as plasmin, a protease, and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a trimeric glycoprotein. Previously we had demonstrated that plasmin was critical to the activation of L-TGF- beta1. In the present study we demonstrated that TSP-1 is also important for the activation of L-TGF- beta1 because the activation can be inhibited by anti-TSP-1 monoclonal antibody. Proteins obtained from alveolar macrophage cell lysates immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for TSP-1 were identified on immunoblots as LAP and TGF-beta1, indicating that TSP-1/L-TGF-beta1 complexes are present on alveolar macrophages. However, in the presence of plasmin both latency-associated peptide and TGF-beta1 were decreased in the same cell lysates, indicating that L-TGF-beta1 associated with TSP-1 is released by plasmin. Using immunofluorescence and antibodies to TGF-beta1 and CD36, a receptor for TSP-1, there was colocalization of TGF-beta1 with CD36. Because TSP-1 but not TGF-beta1 is a natural ligand for CD36, these findings suggest that the L-TGF-beta1 in a complex with TSP-1 localizes to the macrophage cell surface when TSP-1 interacts with its receptor, CD36. Furthermore, the association of TSP-1/L-TGF-beta1 complex with CD36 is necessary to the activation of L-TGF-beta1 because antibodies to CD36 prevent the colocalization of TGF-beta1 with CD36 as observed by immunofluorescence and inhibit activation of the L-TGF-beta1 by explanted alveolar macrophages. These findings suggest that activation of L-TGF-beta1 by plasmin occurs at the cell surface of activated alveolar macrophages and requires a TSP-1/CD36 interaction.',\n",

R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339-340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of approximately 40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC(50) of 3 nM. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of (125)I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC(50) of 13 nM. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be approximately 10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes.',\n",

These events are mediated by NGF as a result of binding to its two cell-surface receptors, TrkA and p75. TrkA is a receptor with tyrosine kinase activity that forms a high-affinity binding site for NGF. Of the five domains comprising its extracellular portion, the immunoglobulin-like domain proximal to the membrane (TrkA-d5 domain) is necessary and sufficient for NGF binding. Here we present the crystal structure of human NGF in complex with human TrkA-d5 at 2.2 A resolution. The ligand-receptor interface consists of two patches of similar size. One patch involves the central beta-sheet that forms the core of the homodimeric NGF molecule and the loops at the carboxy-terminal pole of TrkA-d5. The second patch comprises the amino-terminal residues of NGF, which adopt a helical conformation upon complex formation, packing against the 'ABED' sheet of TrkA-d5. The structure is consistent with results from mutagenesis experiments for all neurotrophins, and indicates that the first patch may constitute a conserved binding motif for all family members, whereas the second patch is specific for the interaction between NGF and TrkA.\",\n",

We report here that [D-Tyr4]melanotan-II and RMI-2001 (Ac-cyclo-[Cys4, Gly5, D-Phe7, Cys10]alpha-MSH-NH2) have significantly higher affinity and potency on the rat melanocortin MC4 receptor as compared to the rat melanocortin MC3 receptor.

Melanotan-II, [Nle4-D-Phe7]alpha-MSH and RMI-2001 were also effective in inducing grooming behavior when administered intravenously. In the absence of purely selective melanocortin MC(3/4) receptor ligands, we demonstrated that careful comparison of ligand potencies in vitro with ligand potencies in vivo, could identify which melanocortin receptor subtype mediated alpha-MSH-induced grooming behavior.

This inhibition was shown to be dependent on a COL IV- or peptide-induced increase in intracellular cAMP (T. A. Shahan et al., Connect. Tissue Res., 40: 221-232, 1999). Attempts to identify the putative receptor(s) on tumor cells led to the isolation of five proteins (Mr 33,000, 52,000, 72,000, 95,000, and 250,000) from melanoma and prostate cells by affinity purification with the alpha3(IV)179-208 peptide. The Mr 52,000, 95,000, and 250,000 proteins were shown to be CD47/integrin-associated protein(IAP), the integrin beta3 subunit, and the alpha(v)beta3 integrin complex, respectively. The Mr 33,000 and 72,000 proteins have not yet been identified. To confirm the specificity of ligand binding to the receptors, cell membranes from either melanoma or prostate tumor cells were pretreated with the unlabeled ligand alpha3(IV)187-191 (-YYSNS-); alternatively, the peptide was pretreated with a peptide-reactive monoclonal antibody (A5D7) before receptor isolation. These treatments inhibited the purification of CD47/IAP, the integrin beta3 subunit, and the alpha(v)beta3 integrin complex from tumor cells. Furthermore, cells treated with CD47/IAP- or the alpha(v)beta3 integrin-reactive antibodies prevented the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide from inhibiting cell proliferation and the subsequent rise in intracellular cAMP. Pretreating cells with the alpha3(IV)187-191 (-YYSNS-) peptide also inhibited their adhesion to the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide substrate, whereas the inactive alpha1(IV)185-203 peptide, from the same region of the alpha1 chain as the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide, had no effect. Incubation of cells with either CD47/IAP and/or alpha(v)beta3 integrin-reactive antibodies inhibited their adhesion to the alpha3(IV)185-203 peptide, whereas antibodies to the beta1 and beta2 integrin subunits were without effect. These data suggest that ALC-COL IV, through its alpha3(IV) chain, inhibits tumor cell proliferation using the receptors CD47/IAP and the alpha(v)beta3 integrin.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Binding of lutropin/choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) to its cognate receptor results in the activation of adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C. This divergent signaling of the LH receptor is based on the independent activation of distinct G protein subfamilies, i.e. , Gs, Gi, and potentially also Gq. To examine the selectivity of LH receptor coupling to phospholipase C beta-activating G proteins, we used an in vivo reconstitution system based on the coexpression of the LH receptor and different G proteins in baculovirus-infected insect cells. In this paper, we describe a refined expression strategy for the LH receptor in insect cells. The receptor protein was inserted into the cell membrane at an expression level of 0.8 pmol/mg of membrane protein. Sf9 cells expressing the LH receptor responded to hCG challenge with a concentration-dependent accumulation of intracellular cAMP (EC50 = 630 nM) but not of inositol phosphates, whereas stimulation of the histamine H1 receptor in Sf9 cells led to increased phospholipase C (PLC) activity. Immunoblotting experiments using G protein-specific antisera revealed the absence of quantitative amounts of alpha i in Sf9 cells, whereas alpha s and alpha q/11 were detected. We therefore attempted to restore the hCG-dependent PLC activation by infection of Sf9 cells with viruses encoding the LH receptor and different G protein alpha subunits. HCG stimulation of cells coexpressing the LH receptor and exogenous alpha i2 resulted in stimulation of PLC activity. In cells coinfected with an alpha i3-baculovirus, hCG challenge led to a minor activation of PLC, whereas no hCG-dependent PLC stimulation was observed in cells coexpressing alpha i1. Most notably, coinfection with baculoviruses encoding alpha q or alpha 11 did not reproduce the PLC activation by the LH receptor. Thus, the murine LH receptor activates adenylyl cyclase via Gs and PLC via selective coupling to Gi2.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Thrombopoietin (TPO) was first described as an activity in thrombocytopenic serum that could stimulate platelet production upon transfer into other animals. The molecular cloning of TPO has allowed a detailed characterisation of its precise biological activities, both in vitro and in vivo. TPO binds its specific receptor, the c-Mpl protein, which is expressed on the surface of target cells, and induces receptor dimerization and activation of intracellular signalling pathways including the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and Ras cascades. TPO is a lineage-dominant cytokine, stimulating megakaryocyte production and maturation in vitro and inducing the greatest elevation in platelet numbers of any known cytokine upon administration to humans or laboratory animals. Indeed, gene targeting studies have established that the TPO/c-Mpl signalling system is the major physiological regulator of steady-state megakaryocyte and platelet production. These studies have also revealed a largely unanticipated role for TPO in the regulation of hemopoietic stem cells. Preclinical studies in animal models have indicated the capacity of c-Mpl ligands to overcome the thrombocytopenia associated with chemo/radiotherapy and clinical trials have already demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Mpl-ligands in elevating platelet counts in humans. It is likely that these molecules will lead to new therapeutics that will find utility in a range of clinical contexts.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Human natural killer cells and a subset of T cells express a repertoire of killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs) that recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. KIRs and T cell receptors (TCRs) bind in a peptide-dependent manner to overlapping regions of peptide-MHC class I complexes. KIRs with two immunoglobulin domains (KIR2Ds) recognize distinct subsets of HLA-C alleles. Here we use surface plasmon resonance to study the binding of soluble forms of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL3 to several peptide-HLA-Cw7 complexes. KIR2DL3 bound to the HLA-Cw7 allele presenting the peptide RYRPGTVAL with a 1:1 stoichiometry and an affinity (K(d) approximately 7 microM at 25 degrees C) within the range of values measured for other cell-cell recognition molecules, including the TCR. Although KIR2DL1 is reported not to recognize the HLA-Cw7 allele in functional assays, it bound RYRPGTVAL/HLA-Cw7, albeit with a 10-20-fold lower affinity. TCR/peptide-MHC interactions are characterized by comparatively slow kinetics and unfavorable entropic changes (Willcox, B. E., Gao, G. F., Wyer, J. R. , Ladbury, J. E., Bell, J. I., Jakobsen, B. K., and van der Merwe, P. A. (1999) Immunity 10, 357-365), suggesting that binding is accompanied by conformational adjustments. In contrast, we show that KIR2DL3 binds RYRPGTVAL/HLA-Cw7 with fast kinetics and a favorable binding entropy, consistent with rigid body association. These results indicate that KIR/peptide-MHC class I interactions have properties typical of other cell-cell recognition molecules, and they highlight the unusual nature of TCR/peptide-MHC recognition.',\n",

Orexin-A and orexin-B increased [Ca2+]i in a concentration dependent manner in CHO-OX1 (pEC50=8.03+/-0.08 and 7. 30+/-0.08 respectively, n=5) and CHO-OX2 (pEC50=8.18+/-0.10 and 8. 43+/-0.09 respectively, n=5) cells. This response was typified as a rapid peak in [Ca2+]i (maximal at 6 - 8 s), followed by a gradually declining secondary phase. Thapsigargin (3 microM) or U73122 (3 microM) abolished the response. In calcium-free conditions the peak response was unaffected but the secondary phase was shortened, returning to basal values within 90 s. Calcium (1.5 mM) replacement restored the secondary phase.

Here we describe the identification of an orphan human G-protein-coupled receptor homologous to rat GPR14 and expressed predominantly in cardiovascular tissue, which functions as a U-II receptor. Goby and human U-II bind to recombinant human GPR14 with high affinity, and the binding is functionally coupled to calcium mobilization. Human U-II is found within both vascular and cardiac tissue (including coronary atheroma) and effectively constricts isolated arteries from non-human primates. The potency of vasoconstriction of U-II is an order of magnitude greater than that of endothelin-1, making human U-II the most potent mammalian vasoconstrictor identified so far. In vivo, human U-II markedly increases total peripheral resistance in anaesthetized non-human primates, a response associated with profound cardiac contractile dysfunction. Furthermore, as U-II immunoreactivity is also found within central nervous system and endocrine tissues, it may have additional activities.\",\n",

In the present study, we characterized the endogenous BMP-6 signaling pathway during osteoblast differentiation. BMP-6 strongly induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in cells of osteoblast lineage, including C2C12 cells, MC3T3-E1 cells, and ROB-C26 cells. The profile of binding of BMP-6 to type I and type II receptors was similar to that of OP-1/BMP-7 in C2C12 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells; BMP-6 strongly bound to activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-2 (also termed ActR-I), together with type II receptors, i.e. BMP type II receptor (BMPR-II) and activin type II receptor (ActR-II). In addition, BMP-6 weakly bound to BMPR-IA (ALK-3), to which BMP-2 also bound. In contrast, binding of BMP-6 to BMPR-IB (ALK-6), and less efficiently to ALK-2 and BMPR-IA, together with BMPR-II was detected in ROB-C26 cells. Intracellular signalling was further studied using C2C12 and MC3T3-E1 cells. Among the receptor-regulated Smads activated by BMP receptors, BMP-6 strongly induced phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Smad5, and less efficiently those of Smad1. However, Smad8 was constitutively phosphorylated, and no further phosphorylation or nuclear accumulation of Smad8 by BMP-6 was observed. These findings indicate that in the process of differentiation to osteoblasts, BMP-6 binds to ALK-2 as well as other type I receptors, and transduces signals mainly through Smad5 and possibly through Smad1.',\n",

IL-11 acts on cells expressing gp130 and the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) alpha-subunit (IL-11Ralpha). The structural epitopes of IL-11 required for the recruitment of the individual receptor subunits have not yet been defined. Based on the structure of CNTF, a three-dimensional model of human IL-11 was built. Using this model, 10 surface exposed amino acid residues of IL-11 were selected for mutagenesis using analogies to the well-characterized receptor recruitment sites of IL-6, CNTF, and LIF. The respective mutants of human IL-11 were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in bacteria. Their biological activities were determined on HepG2 and Ba/F3-130-11alpha cells. Several mutants with substantially decreased bioactivity and one hyperagonistic mutant were identified and further analyzed with regard to recruitment of IL-11Ralpha and gp130. The low-activity mutant I171D still binds IL-11Ralpha but fails to recruit gp130, whereas the hyperagonistic variant R135E more efficiently engages the IL-11R subunits. The low-activity mutants R190E and L194D failed to bind to IL-11Ralpha. These findings reveal a common mechanism of receptor recruitment in the family of IL-6-type cytokines and offer considerable perspectives for the rational design of IL-11 antagonists and hyperagonists.',\n",

In the present study, we show that collagenase-3 binding is calcium-dependent and occurs in a variety of cell types, including osteoblastic and fibroblastic cells. We also present evidence supporting a two-step mechanism of collagenase-3 binding and internalization involving both a specific collagenase-3 receptor and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Ligand blot analysis shows that (125)I-collagenase-3 binds specifically to two proteins ( approximately 170 kDa and approximately 600 kDa) present in UMR 106-01 cells. Western blotting identified the 600-kDa protein as the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Our data suggest that the 170-kDa protein is a specific collagenase-3 receptor. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-null mouse embryo fibroblasts bind but fail to internalize collagenase-3, whereas UMR 106-01 and wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts bind and internalize collagenase-3. Internalization, but not binding, is inhibited by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein. We conclude that the internalization of collagenase-3 requires the participation of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and propose a model in which the cell surface interaction of this ligand requires a sequential contribution from two receptors, with the collagenase-3 receptor acting as a high affinity primary binding site and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein mediating internalization.',\n",

The molecular mechanisms that target the entorhinal axons to specific layers in the hippocampus are not known. EphA5, a member of the Eph receptor family, which has been shown to play critical roles in axon guidance, is expressed in the entorhinal cortex, the origin of the perforant pathway. In addition, ligands that interact with EphA5 are expressed in distinct hippocampal regions during development of the entorhino-hippocampal projection. Of these ligands, ephrin-A3 mRNA is localized both in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus and in the pyramidal cell layer of the cornu ammonis, whereas ephrin-A5 mRNA is only expressed in the pyramidal cell layer of the cornu ammonis. In the dentate gyrus, the ligand protein is not present in the termination zone of the entorhinal efferents (the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus) but is concentrated in the inner molecular layer into which entorhinal efferents do not grow. We used outgrowth and stripe assays to test the effects of ephrin-A3 and ephrin-A5 on the outgrowth behavior of entorhinal axons. This functional analysis revealed that entorhinal neurites were repelled by ephrin-A3 but not by ephrin-A5. These observations suggest that ephrin-A3 plays an important role in the layer-specific termination of the perforant pathway and that this ligand may interact with the EphA5 receptor to restrict entorhinal axon terminals in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus.',\n",

Plexins are widely expressed: in neurons, the expression of a truncated plexin-A1 protein blocks axon repulsion by Sema3A. The cytoplasmic domain of plexins associates with a tyrosine kinase activity. Plexins may also act as ligands mediating repulsion in epithelial cells in vitro.

Titration of C1q alone, C4b alone, and C1q + C4b indicated that the two complement ligands were additive in their ability to support CR1-mediated adhesion of E. Analysis of binding to immobilized CR1 using a BIAcore instrument documented that C1q, C4b, and C3b binding were independent events. Additionally, C1q-dependent binding of immune complexes and heat-aggregated IgG to E was documented. These experiments confirm that the immune adherence receptor in humans, CR1, is the single receptor for all of the opsonic ligands of complement, provide evidence for a single C1q binding site on LHR-D of CR1, and suggest that C1q may participate in immune clearance.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Identification of residues in the monocyte chemotactic protein-1 that contact the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'The CC chemokine, MCP-1, has been identified as a major chemoattractant for T cells and monocytes, and plays a significant role in the pathology of inflammatory diseases. To identify the regions of MCP-1 that contact its receptor, CCR2, we substituted all surface-exposed residues with alanine. Some residues were also mutated to other amino acids to identify the importance of charge, hydrophobicity, or aromaticity at specific positions. The binding affinity of each mutant for CCR2 was assayed with THP-1 and CCR2-transfected CHL cells. The majority of point mutations had no effect. Residues at the N-terminus of the protein, known to be crucial for signaling, contribute less than a factor of 10 to the binding affinity. However, two clusters of primarily basic residues (R24, K35, K38, K49, and Y13), separated by a 35 A hydrophobic groove, reduced the level of binding by 15-100-fold. A peptide fragment encompassing residues 13-35 recapitulated some of the mutational data derived from the intact protein. It exhibited modest binding as a linear peptide and dramatically improved affinity when the region which adopts a single turn of a 3(10)-helix in the protein, which includes R24, was constrained by a disulfide bond. Additional constraints at the ends of the peptide, corresponding to the disulfide between the first and third cysteines in MCP-1, yielded further improvements in affinity. Together, these data suggest a model in which a large surface area of MCP-1 contacts the receptor, and the accumulation of a number of weak interactions results in the 35 pM affinity observed for the wild-type (WT) protein. The receptor binding site of MCP-1 also is significantly different from the binding sites of RANTES and IL-8, providing insight into the issue of receptor specificity. It was previously shown that the N-terminus of CCR2 is critical for binding MCP-1 [Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19084-92; Monteclaro, F. S., and Charo, I. F. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 23186-90]. Point mutations of six acidic residues in this region of the receptor were made to test their role in ligand binding. This identified D25 and D27 of the DYDY motif as being important. On the basis of our data, we propose a model in which the receptor N-terminus lies along the hydrophobic groove in an extended fashion, placing the DYDY motif near the basic cluster involving R24 and K49 of MCP-1. This in turn orients the signaling residues (Y13 and the N-terminus) for productive interaction with the receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'EphA family receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin-A ligands are involved in patterning axonal connections during brain development, but until now a role for these molecules in the mature brain had not been elucidated. Here, we show that both the EphA5 receptor and its ephrin-A ligands (2 and 5) are expressed in the adult mouse hippocampus, and the EphA5 protein is present in a phosphorylated form. Because there are no pharmacological agents available for EphA receptors, we designed recombinant immunoadhesins that specifically bind to the receptor binding site of the ephrin-A ligand (antagonist) or the ligand binding site of the EphA receptor (agonist) and thus target EphA function. We demonstrate that intrahippocampal infusion of an EphA antagonist immunoadhesin leads to impaired performance in two behavioral paradigms, T-maze spontaneous alternation and context-dependent fear conditioning, sensitive to hippocampal function, whereas activation of EphA by infusion of an agonist immunoadhesin results in enhanced performance on these tasks. Because the two behavioral tasks have different motivational, perceptual, and motor requirements, we infer the changes were not caused by these performance factors but rather to cognitive alterations. We also find bidirectional changes in gene expression and in electrophysiological measures of synaptic efficacy that correlate with the behavioral results. Thus, EphA receptors and their ligands are implicated as mediators of plasticity in the adult mammalian brain.',\n",

Immunohistochemistry was performed using well-characterized antibodies against each of the five proteins analyzed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival material. Forty-three normal endometrial samples (16 proliferative, 19 secretory, and 8 hyperplastic) and 41 endometrial adenocarcinoma cases were analyzed. There was variable expression of the growth factor receptors and the ligands in the two principal phases of the menstrual cycle as well as in endometrial adenocarcinoma. In normal endometrium, the c-erbB-3 receptor was weakly expressed in both phases. The c-erbB-4 receptor and all of the ligands examined, neuregulin alpha, neuregulin beta, and betacellulin, were expressed at significantly higher levels in the secretory as compared with the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, suggesting a role for these proteins in endometrial maturation. In endometrial adenocarcinoma, overexpression of c-erbB-3, c-erbB-4, and betacellulin with underexpression of neuregulin a as compared with normal controls was observed. Neuregulin beta expression was not found to be significantly different in the two groups. These results suggest that signaling through the c-erbB-3 and c-erbB-4 receptors and the ligands neuregulin alpha, neuregulin beta, and betacellulin are important in endometrial carcinogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CD97 is a newly identified, activation-associated human leucocyte antigen with seven putative transmembrane domains. It has an extended extracellular segment containing several adhesion molecule structure motifs, and has been shown to interact with the human complement regulator, decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD55). To understand further the interaction between CD97 and DAF, as well as the structure and function of CD97 in general, we have cloned the mouse CD97 cDNA and studied the encoded protein for its membrane association property and ability to interact specifically with the murine decay-accelerating factor. The full-length mouse CD97 cDNA that we have cloned and characterized encodes a protein that is 60% identical to the three epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain-containing form of human CD97 but does not contain the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif which is present in human CD97. Two other alternatively spliced forms of mouse CD97 were also identified. These forms differ by the number of EGF-like sequence repeats present in the N-terminal region. Northern blot analysis revealed that CD97 is expressed widely in mouse tissues and in resting as well as activated cultured mouse splenocytes. Transient transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with the mouse CD97 cDNA in a green-fluorescence protein vector (pEGFP-N1) showed plasma membrane targeting of the expressed protein. Western blot analysis confirmed its membrane association and identified the existence of a processed C-terminal fragment, supporting the notion that CD97 on the cell membrane is composed of post-translationally generated subunits. Adhesion studies demonstrated that normal, but not DAF knockout mouse erythrocytes and splenocytes adhered to mouse CD97-transfected HEK cells. The interaction of CD97 and DAF was found to be species-restrictive in that human erythrocytes were unable to bind to mouse CD97-transfected HEK cells. These results indicate that the general structure, membrane association property and DAF-binding ability of CD97 are conserved and that the adhesive interaction between CD97 and DAF is independent of the RGD motif. The finding that CD97 is distributed widely among various mouse tissues suggests that CD97 may have other roles beyond lymphocyte activation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The solution structure of neuromedin B (NMB) was investigated using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in membrane-mimicking environments. NMB adopts a relaxed helical conformation from Trp(4) to Met(10) in 50% aqueous 2,2, 2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) solution and in 150 mM SDS micelles. Sidechain atoms of the three residues, Trp(4), His(8) and Phe(9) orient toward the same direction and these residues might play a key role on interacting with hydrophobic acyl chains of the phospholipids in the membrane. NOESY experiments performed on NMB in non-deuterated SDS micelle show that aromatic ring protons of Trp(4) and Phe(9) residues are in close contact with methylene protons of SDS micelles. In addition, proton longitudinal relaxation data proved that the interactions between NMB with SDS micelle are characterized as extrinsic interaction. Trp(4) and Phe(9) seem to be important in interaction with receptor and this agrees with the previous studies of structure-activity relationship (Howell, D.C. et al. (1996) Int. J. Pept.

       "  'Abstract': 'Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), a member of the bombesin family of peptides, has been shown to have mitogenic activity in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and to be produced by SCLC in an autocrine fashion. In this report, we demonstrate that both GRP and another member of the bombesin family of peptides, neuromedin B (NMB), are also autocrine growth factors for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14 of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14). By immunoblotting using SDS-PAGE gradient gels fixed in trichloroacetic acid, GRP and NMB were found in fractions of culture medium that had been purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) from NSCLC cell lines. NMB was detected in the conditioned medium of seven of nine cell lines and GRP in seven of nine cell lines; both peptides were produced in six cell lines. In four of the cell lines where both peptides were produced, the relative amount of NMB secreted into the medium was 7-15 times that of GRP; in the other two cases, the relative amounts of GRP and NMB were equivalent. Cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressed the GRPR and NMBR but did not produce either peptide. A subline of A549 cells that was adapted to grow in serum-free and growth factor-free conditions, termed A549-R(0), secreted both bombesin-like peptides (BLPs) into the culture medium. Using either a colony-forming assay or a BrDU incorporation assay, both NMB and GRP were found to be mitogens for three NSCLC cell lines that express mRNA for BLP receptors and secrete BLPs, regardless of which peptide and/or receptor subtype was detected. The monoclonal antibody 2A11, which preferentially recognizes GRP, was able to block the in vitro proliferative response to GRP in the BrDU incorporation assay, and partially blocked the response to NMB. The 2A11 antibody could only partially block the in vivo growth of cell lines that showed proliferative responses to BLPs. 2A11 antibody was more effective against the 239T cell line, which secreted a low amount of GRP into the medium (0.6 nM), compared to the 201T cell line, which secreted a higher amount of both GRP and NMB (4.2 nM and 36.6 nM, respectively). These results suggest that both NMB and GRP are autocrine growth factors for NSCLC, but that the production of NMB and expression of the NMBR may be more prominent than the production of GRP and expression of the GRP receptor. If BLP ligand-receptor systems are to be targeted therapeutically in NSCLC, it will be necessary to inhibit both NMB and GRP.',\n",

However, the physical interaction between DSL proteins and Notch receptors is poorly understood. In this study, we cloned a cDNA for mouse Jagged1 (mJagged1). To identify the receptor interacting with mJagged1 and to gain insight into its binding characteristics, we established two experimental systems using fusion proteins comprising various extracellular parts of mJagged1, a \"cell\" binding assay and a \"solid-phase\" binding assay. mJagged1 physically bound to mouse Notch2 (mNotch2) on the cell surface and to a purified extracellular portion of mNotch2, respectively, in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Scatchard analysis of mJagged1 binding to BaF3 cells and to the soluble Notch2 protein demonstrated dissociation constants of 0.4 and 0.7 nM, respectively, and that the number of mJagged1-binding sites on BaF3 is 5,548 per cell. Furthermore, deletion mutant analyses showed that the DSL domain of mJagged1 is a minimal binding unit and is indispensable for binding to mNotch2. The epidermal growth factor-like repeats of mJagged1 modulate the affinity of the interaction, with the first and second repeats playing a major role. Finally, solid-phase binding assay showed that Jagged1 binds to Notch1 and Notch3 in addition to Notch2, suggesting that mJagged1 is a ligand for multiple Notch receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'By using the yeast two-hybrid system we identified a novel protein from the human brain interacting with the C terminus of somatostatin receptor subtype 2. This protein termed somatostatin receptor interacting protein is characterized by a novel domain structure, consisting of six N-terminal ankyrin repeats followed by SH3 and PDZ domains, several proline-rich regions, and a C-terminal sterile alpha motif. It consists of 2185 amino acid residues encoded by a 9-kilobase pair mRNA; several splice variants have been detected in human and rat cDNA libraries. Sequence comparison suggests that the novel multidomain protein, together with cortactin-binding protein, forms a family of cytoskeletal anchoring proteins. Fractionation of rat brain membranes indicated that somatostatin receptor interacting protein is enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction. The interaction of somatostatin receptor subtype 2 with its interacting protein was verified by overlay assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments from transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Somatostatin receptor subtype 2 and the interacting protein display a striking overlap of their expression patterns in the rat brain.

Hfz1 was shown to couple to Wnt signal transduction pathways by its ability to enhance Wnt induced TCF dependent transcription in both autocrine and paracrine modes. Enhanced TCF dependent signaling was dose dependent with respect to both Wnt-3A and Hfz1. Moreover, Hfz1 deletion mutants with truncated carboxy termini showed markedly reduced capacity to enhance Wnt signal transduction. Specificity was demonstrated with respect to signal transduction by different Wnts. While Wnt-3a, -3, -1 and to a lesser extent Wnt-2 cooperated with Hfz1 in the paracrine assay for TCF dependent signaling, neither Wnt-4, -5a, -5b, -6, -7a nor -7b did so, despite similar levels of expression. However, coimmunoprecipitation of Hfz1 with both Wnt-3a and Wnt-5a indicated that TCF dependent signaling in response to Wnts is not determined solely by their ability to bind the receptor. All of these findings provide strong evidence that Hfz1 is a functional partner for certain Wnts in inducing TCF dependent transcription.',\n",

We evaluated the properties of C(6)-VIP, its analog AcHis(1)-VIP, and the VPAC(2)-selective agonist Ro 25-1553 on the wild-type VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) receptors and on the chimeric receptors exchanging the different domains between both receptors. VIP had a normal affinity and efficacy on the chimeras starting with the amino-terminal VPAC(2) receptor sequence. The binding and functional profile of these chimeric receptors suggested that the high affinity of Ro 25-1553 for VPAC(2) receptors is supported by the amino-terminal extracellular domain, whereas the ability to prefer C(6)-VIP over VIP is supported by the VPAC(2) fifth transmembrane (TM5)-EC(3) receptor domain. These results further support the hypothesis that the central and carboxyl-terminal regions of the peptide (modified in RO 25-1553) recognize the extracellular amino-terminal region domain, whereas the amino-terminal VIP amino acids bind to the TM receptor core. VIP had a reduced affinity and efficacy on the N-VPAC(1)/VPAC(2) and on the N-->EC(2)-VPAC(1)/VPAC(2) chimeric receptors. C(6)-VIP behaved as a high-affinity agonist on these constructions.

The antibodies reacted predominantly with monocytes, granulocytes, dendritic cells, and their precursors, as well as with bone marrow CD34(+), AC133(+), CD90(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. In contrast, SIRP expression was absent or significantly reduced on the majority of myeloid blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

This interaction could be blocked by 4 of 7 SIRPalpha1-reactive MoAbs. In addition, SIRPalpha1 and SIRPalpha2 competed for the same cell binding site, suggesting a common widely expressed SIRP ligand. In an approach to identify this molecule, MoAbs were generated against the SIRP-binding cell line CCRF-CEM, and MoAb CC2C6 was selected because of its capacity to inhibit cell binding to SIRPalpha1. Further analysis showed that this antibody recognized CD47, a ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane protein previously implicated in integrin function, host defense action, and neutrophil migration.

       "  'Abstract': 'Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an important hematopoietic cytokine that exerts its effects by interaction with the GM-CSF receptor (GMR) on the surface of responsive cells. The GM-CSF receptor consists of two subunits: GMRalpha, which binds GM-CSF with low affinity, and GMRbeta, which lacks intrinsic ligand-binding capability but complexes with GMRalpha to form a high-affinity receptor (GMRalpha/beta). We conducted dynamic kinetic analyses of GM-CSF receptors to define the role of GMRbeta in the interaction of ligand and receptor. Our data show that GMRalpha/beta exhibits a higher k(on) than GMRalpha, indicating that GMRbeta facilitates ligand acquisition to the binding pocket. Heterogeneity with regard to GM-CSF dissociation from GMRalpha/beta points to the presence of loose and tight ligand-receptor complexes in high-affinity binding. Although the loose complex has a k(off) similar to GMRalpha, the lower k(off) indicates that GMRbeta inhibits GM-CSF release from the tight receptor complex. The two rates of ligand dissociation may provide for discrete mechanisms of interaction between GM-CSF and its high-affinity receptor. These results show that the beta subunit functions to stabilize ligand binding as well as to facilitate ligand acquisition.',\n",

To determine the mechanism regulating ligand binding affinity and specificity, soluble FGFR1 and FGFR3 binding domains were compared for activity. FGFR1 bound well to FGF2 but poorly to FGF8 and FGF9. In contrast, FGFR3 bound well to FGF8 and FGF9 but poorly to FGF2. The differential ligand binding specificity of these two receptors was exploited to map specific ligand binding regions in mutant and chimeric receptor molecules. Deletion of immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain I did not effect ligand binding, thus localizing the binding region(s) to the distal two Ig domains. Mapping studies identified two regions that contribute to FGF binding. Additionally, FGF2 binding showed positive cooperativity, suggesting the presence of two binding sites on a single FGFR or two interacting sites on an FGFR dimer. Analysis of FGF8 and FGF9 binding to chimeric receptors showed that a broad region spanning Ig domain II and sequences further N-terminal determines binding specificity for these ligands. These data demonstrate that multiple regions of the FGFR regulate ligand binding specificity and that these regions are distinct with respect to different members of the FGF family.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We previously reported that CR-Fc, an Fc chimeric protein containing the cysteine-rich (CR) domain of the mannose receptor, binds to marginal zone metallophilic macrophages (Mo) and B cell areas in the spleen and to subcapsular sinus Mo in lymph nodes of naive mice (CR-Fc(+) cells). Several CR-Fc ligands were found in spleen and lymph node tissue lysates using ligand blots. In this paper we report the identification of two of these ligands as sialoadhesin (Sn), an Mo-specific membrane molecule, and the leukocyte common antigen, CD45. CR-Fc bound selectively to Sn purified from spleen and lymph nodes and to two low molecular weight isoforms of CD45 in a sugar-dependent manner. CR-Fc binding and non-binding forms of Sn, probably derived from CR-Fc(+) and CR-Fc(-) cells respectively, were selected from spleen lysates. Analysis of the glycan pool associated with the CR-Fc-binding form revealed the presence of charged structures resistant to sialidase, absent in the non-binding form, that could correspond to sulfated structures. These results confirm the identification of the CR region of the mannose receptor as a lectin. We also demonstrate that the same glycoprotein expressed in different cells of the same organ can display distinct sugar epitopes that determine its binding properties.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Urotensin II (UII) is a neuropeptide with potent cardiovascular effects. Its sequence is strongly conserved among different species and has structural similarity to somatostatin. No receptor for UII has been molecularly identified from any species so far. GPR14 was cloned as an orphan G protein-coupled receptor with similarity to members of the somatostatin/opioid receptor family. We have now demonstrated that GPR14 is a high affinity receptor for UII and designate it UII-R1a. HEK293 cells and COS-7 cells transfected with rat GPR14 showed strong, dose-dependent calcium mobilization in response to fish, frog, and human UII. Radioligand binding analysis showed high affinity binding of UII to membrane preparations isolated from HEK293 cells stably expressing rat GPR14. In situ hybridization analysis showed that GPR14 was expressed in motor neurons of the spinal cord, smooth muscle cells of the bladder, and muscle cells of the heart. The identification of the first receptor for UII will allow better understanding of the physiological and pharmacological roles of UII.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Three full-length cDNAs encoding functional splice variants of the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) type 1 receptor (PAC1) were isolated from Y-79 retinoblastoma cells and human cerebellum. Although the third intracellular loops of the three splice variants were identical, their N-terminal extracellular domains differed. The first full-length PAC1 variant, PAC1normal (PAC1n), encoded the entire N-terminus, whereas the second variant named PAC1short (PAC1s) was deleted by 21 amino acids (residues 89-109). Finally, the third variant, named PAC1very short (PAC1vs), was deleted by 57 amino acids (residues 53-109). Using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, it was established that all three variants were expressed in neuronal tissues. Binding- and cAMP studies using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably transfected with PAC1n, PAC1s and PAC1vs showed significant differences in the affinities and selectivities towards PACAP38, PACAP27 and VIP. PAC1n bound PACAP38 and PACAP27 with affinities in the low nanomolar range whereas VIP was bound with up to 400-fold lower affinity. PAC1vs preferentially bound PACAP38 (Ki=121 nM) and PACAP27 (Ki=129 nM) over VIP (Ki>1000 nM) but with 100-fold lower affinity than PAC1n. Surprisingly, PAC1s unselectively bound all three ligands with high affinity. These data indicate that residues 53-88 within the N-terminal domain of the PAC1 are important for high affinity ligand binding, whereas residues 89-109 determine the receptor's ligand selectivity.\",\n",

A thrombin-cleaved NH(2)-terminal fragment of osteopontin containing the RGD sequence has recently been shown to also be a ligand for alpha(9)beta(1). In this report, we used site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides to identify the alpha(9)beta(1) recognition sequence in osteopontin. alpha(9)-transfected SW480, Chinese hamster ovary, and L-cells adhered to a recombinant NH(2)-terminal osteopontin fragment in which the RGD site was mutated to RAA (nOPN-RAA). Adhesion was completely inhibited by anti-alpha(9) monoclonal antibody Y9A2, indicating the presence of a non-RGD alpha(9)beta(1) recognition sequence within this fragment. Alanine substitution mutagenesis of 13 additional conserved negatively charged amino acid residues in this fragment had no effect on alpha(9)beta(1)-mediated adhesion, but adhesion was dramatically inhibited by either alanine substitution or deletion of tyrosine 165. A synthetic peptide, SVVYGLR, corresponding to the sequence surrounding Tyr(165), blocked alpha(9)beta(1)-mediated adhesion to nOPN-RAA and exposed a ligand-binding-dependent epitope on the integrin beta(1) subunit on alpha(9)-transfected, but not on mock-transfected cells. These results demonstrate that the linear sequence SVVYGLR directly binds to alpha(9)beta(1) and is responsible for alpha(9)beta(1)-mediated cell adhesion to the NH(2)-terminal fragment of osteopontin.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules bind short peptides derived from proteins synthesized within the cell. These complexes of peptide and class I MHC (pMHC) are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. If a clonotypic T cell receptor expressed on a circulating T cell binds to the pMHC complex, the cell presenting the pMHC is killed. In this manner, some tumor cells expressing aberrant proteins are recognized and removed by the immune system. However, not all tumors are recognized efficiently. One reason hypothesized for poor T cell recognition of tumor-associated peptides is poor binding of those peptides to class I MHC molecules. Many peptides, derived from the proto-oncogene HER-2/neu have been shown to be recognized by cytotoxic T cells derived from HLA-A2(+) patients with breast cancer and other adenocarcinomas. Seven of these peptides were found to bind with intermediate to poor affinity. In particular, GP2 (HER-2/neu residues 654-662) binds very poorly even though it is predicted to bind well based upon the presence of the correct HLA-A2.1 peptide-binding motif. Altering the anchor residues to those most favored by HLA-A2.1 did not significantly improve binding affinity. The crystallographic structure shows that unlike other class I-peptide structures, the center of the peptide does not assume one specific conformation and does not make stabilizing contacts with the peptide-binding cleft.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The knowledge of the binding sites of G protein-coupled cholecystokinin receptors represents important insights that may serve to understand their activation processes and to design or optimize ligands. Our aim was to identify the amino acid of the cholecystokinin-A receptor (CCK-AR) binding site in an interaction with the sulfate of CCK, which is crucial for CCK binding and activity. A three-dimensional model of the [CCK-AR-CCK] complex was built. In this model, Arg197 was the best candidate residue for a ionic interaction with the sulfate of CCK. Arg197 was exchanged for a methionine by site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type and mutated CCK-AR were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells for pharmacological and functional analysis. The mutated receptor on Arg197 did not bind the agonist radioligand 125I-BH-[Thr, Nle]-CCK-9; however, it bound the nonpeptide antagonist [3H]-SR27,897 as the wild-type receptor. The mutant was approximately 1,470- and 3,200-fold less potent than the wild-type CCK-AR to activate G proteins and to induce inositol phosphate production, respectively. This is consistent with the 500-fold lower potency and 800-fold lower affinity of nonsulfated CCK relative to sulfated CCK on the wild-type receptor. These data, together with those showing that the mutated receptor failed to discriminate nonsulfated and sulfated CCK while it retained other pharmacological features of the CCK-AR, strongly support an interaction between Arg197 of the CCK-AR binding site and the sulfate of CCK. In addition, the mutated CCK-AR resembled the low affinity state of the wild-type CCK-AR, suggesting that Arg197-sulfate interaction regulates conformational changes of the CCK-AR that are required for its physiological activation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Mel 1a melatonin receptors belong to the super-family of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein)-coupled receptors. So far, interest in Mel 1a receptor signaling has focused mainly on the modulation of the adenylyl cyclase pathway via pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins. To further investigate signaling of the human Mel 1a receptor, we have developed an antibody directed against the C terminus of this receptor. This antibody detected the Mel 1a receptor as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 60 kDa in immunoblots after separation by SDS-PAGE. It also specifically precipitated the 2-[125I]iodomelatonin (125I-Mel)-labeled receptor from Mel 1a-transfected HEK 293 cells. Coprecipitation experiments showed that G(i2), G(i3), and G(q/11) proteins couple to the Mel 1a receptor in an agonist-dependent and guanine nucleotide-sensitive manner. Coupling was selective since other G proteins present in HEK 293 cells, (G(i1), G(o), G(s), G(z), and G12) were not detected in receptor complexes. Coupling of the Mel 1a receptor to G(i) and G(q) was confirmed by inhibition of high-affinity 125I-Mel binding to receptors with subtype-selective G protein alpha-subunit antibodies. G(i2) and/or G(i3) mediated adenylyl cyclase inhibition while G(q/11) induced a transient elevation in cytosolic calcium concentrations in HEK 293 cells stably expressing Mel 1a receptors. Melatonin-induced cytosolic calcium mobilization via PTX-insensitive G proteins was confirmed in primary cultures of ovine pars tuberalis cells endogenously expressing Mel 1a receptors. In conclusion, we report the development of the first antibody recognizing the cloned human Mel 1a melatonin receptor protein. We show that Mel 1a receptors functionally couple to both PTX-sensitive and PTX-insensitive G proteins. The previously unknown signaling of Mel 1a receptors through G(q/11) widens the spectrum of potential targets for melatonin.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CRH exerts its actions via activation of specific G protein-coupled receptors, which exist in two types, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2, and arise from different genes with multiple spliced variants. RT-PCR amplification of CRH receptor sequences from human myometrium and fetal membranes yielded cDNAs that encode a novel CRH-R type 1 spliced variant. This variant (CRH-R1d) is present in the human pregnant myometrium at term only, which suggests a physiologically important role at the end of human pregnancy and labor. The amino acid sequence of CRH-R1d is identical to the CRH-R1alpha receptor except that it contains an exon deletion resulting in the absence of 14 amino acids in the predicted seventh transmembrane domain. Binding studies in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the CRH-R1d or CRH-R1alpha receptors revealed that the deletion does not change the binding characteristics of the variant receptor. In contrast, studies on the G protein activation demonstrated that CRH-R1d is not well coupled to the four subtypes of G proteins (G(s), G(i), G(o), G(q)) that CRH-R1alpha can activate. These data suggest that although the deleted segment is not important for CRH binding, it plays a crucial role in CRH receptor signal transduction. Second messenger studies of the variant receptor showed that CRH and CRH-like peptides can stimulate the adenylate cyclase system, with reduced sensitivity and potency by 10-fold compared with the CRH-R1alpha. Furthermore, CRH failed to stimulate inositol trisphosphate production. Coexpression studies between the CRH-R1d or CRH-R1alpha showed that this receptor does not play a role as a dominant negative receptor for CRH.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Human somatostatin receptor subtypes 1-5 (sst1-5) were characterised using the agonist radioligands [125I]LTT-SRIF28, [125I][Tyr10]CST14, [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I][Tyr3]octreotide in stably transfected Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells (CCL39 cells). The radioligands used labelled saturable and high-affinity populations of sites in each instance; at sst1-4 receptors maximum binding (Bmax) was roughly equivalent. By contrast, at sst5 receptors Bmax determined with [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I][Tyr3]octreotide was significantly lower (two-and eightfold) compared with [125I]LTT-SRIF28 and [125I][Tyr10]CST14. Experiments were performed with the stable GTP-analogue guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp) to establish guanine nucleotide sensitivity of agonist binding to sst1-5 receptors. The sensitivity towards GppNHp was quite variable depending on receptor and/or ligand. At sst1 and sst4 receptors, GppNHp produced little effect overall, whereas binding to sst3 and sst2 receptors was reduced by 70 and >80%, respectively. At sst5 receptors, the binding of [125I]LTT-SRIF28 and [125I][Tyr10]CST14 was only slightly affected by GppNHp, while [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I][Tyr3]octreotide binding was almost entirely inhibited. Thus, [125I][Tyr3]octreotide labelled about 26-fold less sst5 receptors than [125I]LTT-SRIF28, in the presence of 10 microM GppNHp. These discrepancies in guanine nucleotide sensitivity, were confirmed in GppNHp competition experiments. Competition studies were performed at the five receptors labelled with the different radioligands to establish their respective pharmacological profiles: the rank order of affinity was largely radioligand-independent at sst1-4 receptors, in contrast to sst5 receptors where it was radioligand-dependent. Thus, the pharmacological profile of [125I]LTT-SRIF28- and [125I][Tyr10]CST14-labelled sst5 sites correlated highly significantly, but did not correlate with the affinity profiles defined with [125I]CGP 23996 and [125I][Tyr3]octreotide binding to sst5 receptors. Depending on the agonist radioligand used and the receptor studied, it would appear that binding can be essentially to a guanine nucleotide-sensitive state (e.g. sst2 or sst3), a guanine nucleotide-insensitive state (sst1 or sst4) or a mixture of both (sst5); in the latter case, each radioligand defining a more or less different rank order of affinity at the same receptor. In summary, the differences in agonist receptor binding and guanine nucleotide sensitivity cannot be explained by the ternary complex model or its variations, but rather suggest the existence of multiple agonist-specific receptor states which vary from one receptor to another.',\n",

In its native state, gp120(LAI) is able to elicit specific multimolecular complexes with these membrane ligands at the surface of the cells; most of the interactions are abolished by mannan or heparin but not by dextran. Similarly, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha interacts not only with CXCR4 expressed by CXCR4(+) CD4(+) U937, CEM, and HOS-CD4(+) CXCR4(+) cells but also with CD4 expressed by intact U937, CEM, and HOS-CD4(+) CXCR4(+/-) cells or electroblotted onto Immobilon. SDF-1alpha binding to CD4(+) CXCR4(+/-) cells, or soluble CD4 electroblotted onto Immobilon, is significantly inhibited by sCD4, whereas truncated sCD4 lacking D3 and D4 domains had no significant effect, which indicates that SDF-1 binds to CD4 but at regions different from the HIV-gp120-binding site. Heparin and mannan also inhibit SDF-1alpha binding to intact CD4(+) CXCR4(+/-) cells, and electroblotted soluble CD4. Heparitinase treatment of such cells reduced SDF-1alpha binding. These data demonstrate that glycans and glycosaminoglycans are directly or indirectly involved in the interactions of HIV-1 gp120(LAI) and of SDF-1alpha with membrane ligands of CD4(+) CXCR4(+) cells and thus could play a role both in HIV-1 infection and in the physiology of SDF-1alpha.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Guanylate Cyclase C (GCC) serves as a receptor for the endogenous ligands, guanylin and uroguanylin, as well as the family of bacterial heat-stable enterotoxins (ST), which are one of the major causes of diarrhoea the world over. We had earlier provided evidence that GCC, present in the human colonic T84 cell line, is desensitized on prolonged exposure to ST, and this desensitization was reflected in a reduced ST-stimulated guanylate cyclase activity of GCC [Bakre, M.M. & Visweswariah, S.S. (1997) FEBS Lett. 408, 345-349]. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms that underlie this cellular desensitization process. Desensitization of T84 cells was not a result of reduction in GCC present in membranes prepared from desensitized T84 cells, nor due to increased cGMP-phosphodiesterase activity associated with the membrane fraction. The decrease in ST-stimulatable guanylate cyclase activity of GCC was due to a dramatic reduction in the Vmax of the cyclase, which was also seen when MnGTP was used as the substrate. GCC undergoes ligand-induced inactivation in vitro, which is alleviated in the presence of ATP. In vivo desensitized GCC could be further inactivated in vitro when preincubated with ST, indicating that the two mechanisms of GCC inactivation are distinct. Cellular refractoriness as reflected by a reduced responsiveness to further ST-stimulation following prior exposure to IST, coupled with GCC desensitization was also observed in another colonic cell line, Caco2. However, HEK293 cells, stably transfected with GCC cDNA, when exposed to ST for prolonged periods, did not result in GCC desensitization, indicating that desensitization of GCC appeared to be a cell specific phenomenon. GCC expressed in HEK293-GCC cells, however, showed in vitro ligand induced inactivation, suggesting that there are two independent means of ligand-induced desensitization of GCC, perhaps distinct from the mechanisms that have been described earlier for other members of the guanylate cyclase receptor family.',\n",

In this study we compared a new cyclic antagonist, F-[OPdChaWR], with an acyclic derivative, MeFKPdChaWr, for their capacities to bind to C5aR on human PMN and human umbilical artery membranes. We also compared their inhibition of myeloperoxidase (MPO) secretion from human PMNs and their inhibition of human umbilical artery contraction induced by human recombinant C5a. 2. In both PMNs and umbilical artery, the cyclic and acyclic C5a antagonists displayed insurmountable antagonism against C5a. There were differences in selectivities for the C5aR with F-[OPdChaWR] (pKb 8.64+/-0.21) being 30 times more potent than MeFKPdChaWr (pKb 7.16+/-0.11, P<0.05) in PMNs, but of similar potency (pKb 8.19+/-0.38 vs pKb 8.28+/-0.29, respectively) in umbilical artery. This trend was also reflected in their relative binding affinities, both antagonists having similar affinities (-logIC50 values) for C5aR in umbilical artery membranes (F-[OPdChaWR], 7.00+/-0.46; MeFKPdChaWr, 7.23+/-0.17), whereas in PMN membranes the C5aR affinity of the cycle F-[OPdChaWR] (7.05+/-0. 06) was four times higher than that of acyclic MeFKPdChaWr (6.43+/-0. 24, P<0.05). 3. In summary, the results reveal that these antagonists are insurmountable in nature against C5a for C5aR on at least two human cell types, and the differences in relative receptor binding affinities and antagonistic potencies against C5a are consistent with differences in receptors within these cell types. The nature of these differences is yet to be elucidated.',\n",

They act through GHS-R, a G-protein-coupled receptor for which the ligand is unknown. Recent cloning of GHS-R strongly suggests that an endogenous ligand for the receptor does exist and that there is a mechanism for regulating GH release that is distinct from its regulation by hypothalamic growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). We now report the purification and identification in rat stomach of an endogenous ligand specific for GHS-R. The purified ligand is a peptide of 28 amino acids, in which the serine 3 residue is n-octanoylated. The acylated peptide specifically releases GH both in vivo and in vitro, and O-n-octanoylation at serine 3 is essential for the activity. We designate the GH-releasing peptide 'ghrelin' (ghre is the Proto-Indo-European root of the word 'grow'). Human ghrelin is homologous to rat ghrelin apart from two amino acids. The occurrence of ghrelin in both rat and human indicates that GH release from the pituitary may be regulated not only by hypothalamic GHRH, but also by ghrelin.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Complement component 3 (C3) and alpha(2)-macroglobulin evolved from a common, evolutionarily old, ancestor gene. Low density lipoprotein-receptor-related protein/alpha(2)-macroglobulin receptor (LRP/alpha(2)MR), a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, is responsible for the clearance of alpha(2)-macroglobulin-protease complexes. In this study, we examined whether C3 has conserved affinity for LRP/alpha(2)MR. Ligand blot experiments with human (125)I-C3 on endosomal proteins show binding to a 600-kDa protein, indistinguishable from LRP/alpha(2)MR by the following criteria: it is competed by receptor-associated protein (the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein that impairs binding of all ligands to LRP/alpha(2)MR) and by lactoferrin and Pseudomonas exotoxin, other well known ligands of the multifunctional receptor. Binding of C3 is sensitive to reduction of the receptor and is Ca(2+)-dependent. All these features are typical for cysteine-rich binding repeats of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. In LRP/alpha(2)MR, they are found in four cassettes (2, 8, 10, and 11 repeats). Ligand blotting to chicken LR8 demonstrates that a single 8-fold repeat is sufficient for binding. Confocal microscopy visualizes initial surface labeling of human fibroblasts incubated with fluorescent labeled C3, which changes after 5 min to an intracellular vesicular staining pattern that is abolished in the presence of receptor-associated protein. Cell uptake is abolished in mouse fibroblasts deficient in LRP/alpha(2)MR. Native plasma C3 is not internalized. We demonstrate that the capacity to internalize C3 is saturable and exhibits a K(D) value of 17 nM. After intravenous injection, rat hepatocytes accumulate C3 in sedimentable vesicles with a density typical for endosomes. In conclusion, our ligand blot and uptake studies demonstrate the competence of the LRP/alpha(2)MR to bind and endocytose C3 and provide evidence for an LRP/alpha(2)MR-mediated system participating in C3 metabolism.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The apelin peptide was recently discovered and demonstrated to be the endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor, APJ. A search of the GenBank databases retrieved a rat expressed sequence tag partially encoding the preproapelin sequence. The GenBank search also revealed a human sequence on chromosome Xq25-26.1, containing the gene encoding preproapelin. We have used the rat sequence to screen a rat brain cDNA library to obtain a cDNA encoding the full-length open reading frame of rat preproapelin. This cDNA encoded a protein of 77 amino acids, sharing an identity of 82% with human preproapelin. Northern and in situ hybridization analyses revealed both human and rat apelin and APJ to be expressed in the brain and periphery. Both sequence and mRNA expression distribution analyses revealed similarities between apelin and angiotensin II, suggesting they that share related physiological roles. A synthetic apelin peptide was injected intravenously into male Wistar rats, resulting in immediate lowering of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which persisted for several minutes. Intraperitoneal apelin injections induced an increase in drinking behavior within the first 30 min after injection, with a return to baseline within 1 h.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have recently found a novel functional unit of cell-cell adhesion at cadherin-based adherens junctions, consisting of at least nectin, a homophilic cell adhesion molecule, and afadin, an actin filament-binding protein, which connects nectin to the actin cytoskeleton. Here we studied a mechanism of cell-cell adhesion of the nectin-afadin system by use of a cadherin-deficient L cell line stably expressing the intact form of mouse nectin-2alpha, a truncated form of nectin-2alpha incapable of interacting with afadin (nectin-2alpha-DeltaC), or a point-mutated form of nectin-2alpha capable of interacting with afadin and a cadherin-expressing EL cell line, which transiently expressed the point-mutated form of nectin-2alpha. We found that the interaction of nectin-2alpha with afadin was necessary for their clustering at cell-cell contact sites. However, nectin-2alpha-DeltaC showed cis dimerization and trans interaction, both of which did not require the interaction of nectin-2alpha with afadin. We have previously shown in EL cells that the interaction of nectin-1 with afadin is necessary for its recruitment to adherens junctions. We found that the trans interaction of nectin-2alpha was furthermore necessary for this recruitment. On the basis of these observations, we propose a model for the mechanism of cell-cell adhesion of nectin and roles of afadin in this mechanism.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Synthetic ligands have been identified that reset and amplify the cycle of pulsatile GH secretion by interacting with the orphan GH-secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). The GHS-R is rhodopsin like, but does not obviously belong to any of the established G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) subfamilies. We recently characterized the closely related orphan family member, GPR38, as the motilin receptor. A common property of both receptors is that they amplify and sustain pulsatile biological responses in the continued presence of their respective ligands. To efficiently identify additional members of this new GPCR family, we explored a vertebrate species having a compact genome, that was evolutionary distant from human, but where functionally important genes were likely to be conserved. Accordingly, three distinct full-length clones, encoding proteins of significant identity to the human GHS-R, were isolated from the Pufferfish (Spheroides nephelus). Southern analyses showed that the three cloned Pufferfish genes are highly conserved across species. The gene with closest identity (58%) was activated by three synthetic ligands that were chosen for their very high selectivity on the GHS-R as illustrated by their specificity in activating the wild-type human GHS-R but not the E124Q mutant. These results indicate that the ligand activation domain of the GHS-R has been evolutionary conserved from Pufferfish to human (400 million years), supporting the notion that the GHS-R and its natural ligand play a fundamentally important role in biology. Furthermore, they illustrate the power of exploiting the compact Pufferfish genome for simplifying the isolation of endocrinologically important receptor families.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Mice carrying a targeted disruption of BmprIB were generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. BmprIB(-/-) mice are viable and, in spite of the widespread expression of BMPRIB throughout the developing skeleton, exhibit defects that are largely restricted to the appendicular skeleton. Using molecular markers, we show that the initial formation of the digital rays occurs normally in null mutants, but proliferation of prechondrogenic cells and chondrocyte differentiation in the phalangeal region are markedly reduced. Our results suggest that BMPRIB-mediated signaling is required for cell proliferation after commitment to the chondrogenic lineage. Analyses of BmprIB and Gdf5 single mutants, as well as BmprIB; Gdf5 double mutants suggests that GDF5 is a ligand for BMPRIB in vivo. BmprIB; Bmp7 double mutants were constructed in order to examine whether BMPRIB has overlapping functions with other type I BMP receptors. BmprIB; Bmp7 double mutants exhibit severe appendicular skeletal defects, suggesting that BMPRIB and BMP7 act in distinct, but overlapping pathways. These results also demonstrate that in the absence of BMPRIB, BMP7 plays an essential role in appendicular skeletal development. Therefore, rather than having a unique role, BMPRIB has broadly overlapping functions with other BMP receptors during skeletal development.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP) is a multifunctional endocytic receptor that is expressed abundantly in neurons of the CNS. Both LRP and several of its ligands, including tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), apolipoprotein E/lipoproteins, alpha(2)-macroglobulin, and the beta-amyloid precursor protein, have been implicated in various neuronal functions and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. It has been reported that induction of tPA expression may contribute to activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In addition, long-term potentiation (LTP) is significantly decreased in mice lacking tPA. Here we demonstrate that tPA receptor LRP is abundantly expressed in hippocampal neurons and participates in hippocampal LTP. Perfusion of hippocampal slices with receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist for ligand interactions with LRP, significantly reduced late-phase LTP (L-LTP). In addition, RAP also blocked the enhancing effect of synaptic potentiation by exogenous tPA in hippocampal slices prepared from tPA knock-out mice. Metabolic labeling and ligand binding analyses showed that both tPA and LRP are synthesized by hippocampal neurons and that LRP is the major cell surface receptor that binds tPA. Finally, we found that tPA binding to LRP in hippocampal neurons enhances the activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, a key molecule that is known to be involved in L-LTP. Taken together, our results demonstrate that interactions between tPA and cell surface LRP are important for hippocampal L-LTP.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Out of the almost 17 members of the TNF superfamily, TNF is probably the most potent inducer of apoptosis. TNF activates both cell-survival and cell-death mechanisms simultaneously. Activation of NF-kB-dependent genes regulates the survival and proliferative effects pf TNF, whereas activation of caspases regulates the apoptotic effects. TNF-induced apoptosis is mediated primarily through the activation of type I receptors, the death domain of which recruits more than a dozen different signaling proteins, which together are considered part of an apoptotic cascade. This cascade does not, however, account for the role of reactive oxygen intermediates, ceramide, phospholipases, and serine proteases which are also implicated in TNF-induced apoptosis. This cascade also does not explain how type II TNF receptors which lack the death domain, induce apoptosis. Nevertheless, this review of apoptosis signaling will be limited to those proteins that makeup the cascade.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"In this review, we summarize the subunit structure of the interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 receptor system and the molecular mechanism of signals through the cytokine receptor systems. We have demonstrated that two different forms of IL-4R exist, classical and alternative. Classical IL-4R is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and consists of IL-4R p140 (beta) and IL-2R gamma (gamma c) chains. The alternative form of IL-4R is predominantly expressed in nonhematopoietic cells and consists of IL-4R beta and IL-13R alpha' chains. Moreover, the alternative form of IL-4R is also used as a functional component in the IL-13R complex. For signal transduction through IL-4R and IL-13R, we have demonstrated that in nonhematopoietic cells, Janus protein tyrosine kinase (JAK) 2 is phosphorylated and activated instead of JAK3 tyrosine kinase. While JAK3 is required for signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT6) activation in hematopoietic cells, we recently demonstrated that in nonhematopoietic cells JAK2 is required for STAT6 activation for the alternative form of IL-4R. Thus, a major difference exists between hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells with regard to structure and signal transduction through the IL-4R and IL-13R systems.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Signal transfer between the protease-activated PAR1 thrombin receptor and membrane-associated heterotrimeric G proteins is mediated by protein-protein interactions. We constructed a yeast signaling system that resolves domain-specific functions of binding from coupling in the Galpha subunit. The endogenous yeast Galpha subunit, Gpa1, does not bind to PAR1 and served as a null structural template. N- and C-terminal portions of mammalian G(i2) and G(16) were substituted back into the Gpa1 template and gain-of-function assessed. The C-terminal third of G(16), but not of G(i2), provides sufficient interactions for coupling to occur with PAR1. The N-terminal two-thirds of G(i2) also contains sufficient determinants to bind and couple to PAR1 and overcome the otherwise negative or missing interactions supplied by the C-terminal third of Gpa1. Replacement of the N-terminal alpha-helix of G(i2), residues 1-34, with those of Gpa1 abolishes coupling but not binding to PAR1 or to betagamma subunits. These data support a model that the N-terminal alphaN helix of the Galpha subunit is physically interposed between PAR1 and the Gbeta subunit and directly assists in transferring the signal between agonist-activated receptor and G protein.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CD40 is a cell surface receptor that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor-R (TNF-R) family, and that was first identified and functionally characterized on B lymphocytes. Its critical role in T cell-dependent humoral immune responses was demonstrated by patients with the hyper-IgM syndrome, as well as by gene targeting in mice. However, in recent years it has become clear that CD40 is expressed much more broadly, including expression on monocytes, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. In addition, the CD40-ligand (CD40-L/CD154), a member of the TNF family, is also expressed more widely than activated CD4+ T cells only. Therefore it is now thought that CD40-CD40-L interactions play a more general role in immune regulation. Collectively these studies have culminated in pre-clinical and clinical studies that are in progress. This article reviews recent developments in this field of research, with main emphasis on (1) structure and expression of CD40 and its ligand; (2) CD40 signal transduction; (3) in vitro function of CD40 on different cell types; and (4) in vivo functions of CD40/CD40-L interactions.',\n",

Here, expression of an EphB6 ligand in the pro-B leukemic cell line, Reh, is demonstrated by binding of soluble EphB6-Fc fusion protein to the Reh cells. The ligand belongs to the subgroup of membrane spanning ligands, as suggested by the fact that phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment did not abrogate binding of EphB6-Fc. Two transmembrane Eph receptor ligands, ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2, were identified in Reh cells. Analysis of EphB6-Fc fusion protein binding to ephrin-B1 or ephrin-B2 transfected COS cells revealed a high-affinity saturable binding between EphB6-Fc and ephrin-B2, but not with ephrin-B1. In mice, EphB6 has previously been shown to be expressed in thymus. Here, we show expression of EphB6 in human thymus, as well as the expression of ephrin-B2 in both human and mouse thymus.

Our observations also indicate that MMP-9, as well as MMP-2, proteolytically cleaves latent TGF-beta, providing a novel and potentially important mechanism for TGF-beta activation. In addition, we show that MMP-9 localization to the surface of normal keratinocytes is CD44 dependent and can activate latent TGF-beta. These observations suggest that coordinated CD44, MMP-9, and TGF-beta function may provide a physiological mechanism of tissue remodeling that can be adopted by malignant cells to promote tumor growth and invasion.',\n",

CR3 is one of eight related repeats that constitute a major ligand binding region of LRP. The structure is very similar in overall fold to homologous complement-like repeat CR8 from LRP and complement-like repeats LB1, LB2, and LB5 from the low density lipoprotein receptor and contains a short two-strand antiparallel beta-sheet, a one turn alpha-helix, and a high affinity calcium site with coordination from four carboxyls and two backbone carbonyls. The surface electrostatics and topography are, however, quite distinct from each of these other repeats. Two-dimensional (1)H,(15)N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra provide evidence for a specific, though relatively weak (K(d) approximately 140 microM), interaction between CR3 and human alpha2-macroglobulin receptor binding domain that involves a contiguous patch of surface residues in the central region of CR3. This specific interaction is consistent with a mode of LRP binding to ligands that uses contributions from more than one domain to generate a wide array of different binding sites, each with overall high affinity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CD7 is a 40-kDa protein found primarily on T, NK, and pre-B cells; the function of the CD7 protein in the immune system is largely unknown. The K12 (SECTM1) protein was originally identified by its location just upstream of the CD7 locus. The K12 gene encodes a transmembrane protein of unknown function. In order to clone a K12-binding protein, we generated a soluble version of the human K12 protein by fusing its extracellular domain to the Fc portion of human IgG(1). Flow cytometry experiments showed that the K12-Fc fusion protein bound at high levels to both human T and NK cells. Precipitation experiments using K12-Fc on (35)S-radiolabeled NK cells lysates indicated that the K12 cognate was an approximately 40-kDa protein. A human peripheral blood T cell cDNA expression library was screened with the K12-Fc protein, and two independent, positive cDNA clones were identified and sequenced. Both cDNAs encoded the same protein, which was CD7. Thus, K12 and CD7 are cognate proteins that are located next to each other on human chromosome 17q25. Additionally, we have cloned the gene encoding the mouse homologue of K12, shown that it maps near the mouse CD7 gene on chromosome 11, and established that the mouse K12 protein binds to mouse, but not human, CD7. Mouse K12-Fc inhibited in a dose-dependent manner concanavalin A-induced proliferation, but not anti-TcRalpha/beta induced proliferation, of mouse lymph node T cells. Human K12-Fc stimulated the up-regulation of CD25, CD54, and CD69 on human NK cells in vitro.',\n",

Displacement profiles of 125I-CKbeta8 (25-99) on freshly prepared human monocytes indicated that CCR1 was the major receptor for CKbeta8. We conclude that CCR1 is a receptor for different-length CKbeta8 and that CKbeta8 (25-99) has a similar affinity for CCR1 as macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha).

       "  'Abstract': 'Interleukin (IL)-2 interacts with two types of functional receptors (IL-2Ralphabetagamma and IL-2Rbetagamma) and acts on a broad range of target cells involved in inflammatory reactions and immune responses. For the first time, we show that a chemically synthesized fragment of the IL-2 sequence can fold into a molecule mimicking the quaternary structure of a hemopoietin. Indeed, peptide p1-30 (containing amino acids 1-30, covering the entire alpha helix A of IL-2) spontaneously folds into an alpha-helical homotetramer and stimulates the growth of T cell lines expressing human IL-2Rbeta, whereas shorter versions of the peptide lack helical structure and are inactive. We also demonstrate that this neocytokine interacts with a previously undescribed dimeric form of IL-2Rbeta. In agreement with its binding to IL-2Rbeta, p1-30 activates Shc and p56(lck) but unlike IL-2, fails to activate Janus kinase (Jak)1, Jak3, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). Unexpectedly, we also show that p1-30 activates Tyk2, thus suggesting that IL-2Rbeta may bind to different Jaks depending on its oligomerization. At the cellular level, p1-30 induces lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and preferentially activates CD8(low) lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which constitutively express IL-2Rbeta. A significant interferon gamma production is also detected after p1-30 stimulation. A mutant form of p1-30 (Asp20-->Lys), which is likely unable to induce vascular leak syndrome, remains capable of generating LAK cells, like the original p1-30 peptide. Altogether, our data suggest that p1-30 has therapeutic potential.',\n",

We have investigated whether the type VIII collagen stimulates smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and invasion by binding to integrin receptors and up-regulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production. SMCs attached to plates coated with type VIII collagen in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal attachment occurring with coating solutions containing 25 microgram/ml collagen. Type VIII collagen at 100 microgram/ml stimulated an 83-fold increase in the migration of SMCs in a chemotaxis chamber. Antibodies against beta1 integrin receptors prevented attachment and migration of SMCs. Antibodies against alpha1 or alpha2 integrins reduced attachment of SMCs to type VIII collagen by 29% and 77%, respectively. We found that SMCs grown from the rat neointima, but not medial SMCs, increased their production of MMP-2 and -9 on adherence to type VIII collagen. This suggests that there is an important difference in phenotype between intimal and medial SMCs and that intimal SMCs have distinct matrix-dependent signaling mechanisms. Our findings suggest that type VIII collagen deposited in vascular lesions functions to promote SMC attachment and chemotaxis, and signals through integrin receptors to stimulate MMP synthesis, all of which are important mechanisms used in cell migration and invasion.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The mammalian Ste20 kinase Nck-interacting kinase (NIK) specifically activates the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase module. NIK also binds the SH3 domains of the SH2/SH3 adapter protein Nck. To determine whether Nck functions as an adapter to couple NIK to a receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, we determined whether NIK is activated by Eph receptors (EphR). EphRs constitute the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), and members of this family play important roles in patterning of the nervous and vascular systems. In this report, we show that NIK kinase activity is specifically increased in cells stimulated by two EphRs, EphB1 and EphB2. EphB1 kinase activity and phosphorylation of a juxtamembrane tyrosine (Y594), conserved in all Eph receptors, are both critical for NIK activation by EphB1. Although pY594 in the EphB1R has previously been shown to bind the SH2 domain of Nck, we found that stimulation of EphB1 and EphB2 led predominantly to a complex between NIK/Nck, p62(dok), RasGAP, and an unidentified 145-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p62(dok) most probably binds directly to the SH2 domain of Nck and RasGAP and indirectly to NIK bound to the SH3 domain of Nck. We found that NIK activation is also critical for coupling EphB1R to biological responses that include the activation of integrins and JNK by EphB1. Taken together, these findings support a model in which the recruitment of the Ste20 kinase NIK to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins by Nck is an important proximal step in the signaling cascade downstream of EphRs.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) functions as an important regulator of the protein C anticoagulant pathway by binding protein C and enhancing activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. EPCR binds to both protein C and activated protein C (APC) with high affinity. A soluble form of EPCR (sEPCR) circulates in plasma and inhibits APC anticoagulant activity. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms by which sEPCR modulates APC function. Soluble EPCR inhibited the inactivation of factor Va by APC only in the presence of phospholipid vesicles. By using flow cytometric analysis in the presence of 3 mM CaCl(2) and 0. 6 mM MgCl(2), sEPCR inhibited the binding of protein C and APC to phospholipid vesicles (K(i) = 40 +/- 7 and 33 +/- 4 nM, respectively). Without MgCl(2), the K(i) values increased approximately 4-fold. Double label flow cytometric analysis using fluorescein-APC and Texas Red-sEPCR indicated that the APC.sEPCR complex does not interact with phospholipid vesicles. By using surface plasmon resonance, we found that sEPCR also inhibited binding of protein C to phospholipid in a dose-dependent fashion (K(i) = 32 nM). To explore the possibility that sEPCR evokes structural changes in APC, fluorescence spectroscopy studies were performed to monitor sEPCR/Fl-APC interactions. sEPCR binds saturably to Fl-APC (K(d) = 27 +/- 13 nM) with a maximum decrease in Fl-APC fluorescence of 10.8 +/- 0.6%. sEPCR also stimulated the amidolytic activity of APC toward synthetic substrates. We conclude that sEPCR binding to APC blocks phospholipid interaction and alters the active site of APC.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The protein cross-linking enzyme tissue transglutaminase binds in vitro with high affinity to fibronectin via its 42-kD gelatin-binding domain. Here we report that cell surface transglutaminase mediates adhesion and spreading of cells on the 42-kD fibronectin fragment, which lacks integrin-binding motifs. Overexpression of tissue transglutaminase increases its amount on the cell surface, enhances adhesion and spreading on fibronectin and its 42-kD fragment, enlarges focal adhesions, and amplifies adhesion-dependent phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. These effects are specific for tissue transglutaminase and are not shared by its functional homologue, a catalytic subunit of factor XIII. Adhesive function of tissue transglutaminase does not require its cross-linking activity but depends on its stable noncovalent association with integrins. Transglutaminase interacts directly with multiple integrins of beta1 and beta3 subfamilies, but not with beta2 integrins. Complexes of transglutaminase with integrins are formed inside the cell during biosynthesis and accumulate on the surface and in focal adhesions. Together our results demonstrate that tissue transglutaminase mediates the interaction of integrins with fibronectin, thereby acting as an integrin-associated coreceptor to promote cell adhesion and spreading.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A site-directed mutagenesis approach has been used to gain insight into the molecular events whereby the heptadecapeptide nociceptin binds and activates the opioid receptor-like 1 (ORL1) receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor. Alanine mutation, in the human ORL1 receptor, of transmembrane amino acid residues that are conserved in opioid receptors, Asp(130) and Tyr(131) in transmembrane segment (TM) III, Phe(220) and Phe(224) in TM V, and Trp(276) in TM VI, yields mutant receptors with reduced affinity, and proportionally decreased reactivity, toward nociceptin. Least to most deleterious in this respect are Ala substitutions of Phe(220) approximately W276A < Tyr(131) << Phe(224) </= Asp(130). The dramatic effects of the D130A mutation on nociceptin binding and activity are not reversed in the D130N mutant, whereas those of the Y131A mutation are totally suppressed in Y131F. This suggests that a negative charge at position 130, and a phenyl ring at position 131 in TM III, are critical for occupancy and/or activation of the receptor by nociceptin. Alanine replacement of glutamine 286, located at the C terminus of TM VI, yields a mutant receptor that binds nociceptin with nearly the same affinity as does the wild-type receptor (K(d) values of 0.13 and 0.22 nM, respectively) but, unlike the latter, is unable to mediate nociceptin inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP synthesis in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells (ED(50) > 10,000 nM compared with 0.8 nM at the wild-type receptor). In all respects, this mutant receptor appears to be functionally inactive, indicating that residue Gln(286) may play a pivotal role in ORL1 receptor-mediated transduction of the nociceptin signal.',\n",

To identify alpha(4) subunit amino acids important for alpha(4)beta(7)/MAdCAM-1 interaction, we expressed mutant alpha(4) and wild type beta(7) chains in K562 cells and analyzed the effect of the mutations on cell adhesion to a soluble MAdCAM-1 (sMAdCAM-1-Ig). Transfectants expressing mutated alpha(4) at Tyr(187) displayed a substantial decrease in adhesion to this ligand, which was associated with a reduced alpha(4)beta(7)/sMAdCAM-1-Ig interaction, as determined by soluble binding assays. Addition of Mn(2+) to the adhesion assays did not restore the impaired adhesion. Mutations at alpha(4) Gln(152)Asp(153) also affected transfectant adhesion to sMAdCAM-1-Ig, but did not involve an alteration of alpha(4)beta(7)/MAdCAM-1 binding, and adhesion was restored by Mn(2+). Instead, mutations at alpha(4) Asn(123)Glu(124) did not affect this adhesion. Mutation of alpha(4) Tyr(187) abolished alpha(4)beta(7)-mediated cell adhesion to CS-1/fibronectin, an additional ligand for alpha(4)beta(7), while alpha(4) Gln(152)Asp(153) transfectant mutants showed a reduced adhesion. These results identify alpha(4) Tyr(187) as a key residue during receptor alpha(4)beta(7)/ligand interactions, indicating that it plays important roles in alpha(4)beta(7)-mediated leukocyte adhesion, and provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention in several inflammatory pathologies.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a platelet-derived growth factor-inducible, 18-kDa heparin-binding cytokine that signals diverse phenotypes in normal and deregulated cellular growth and differentiation. To seek the mechanisms of PTN signaling, we studied the interactions of PTN with the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) beta/zeta in U373-MG cells. Our results suggest that PTN is a natural ligand for RPTP beta/zeta. PTN signals through \"ligand-dependent receptor inactivation\" of RPTP beta/zeta and disrupts its normal roles in the regulation of steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules. We have found that PTN binds to and functionally inactivates the catalytic activity of RPTP beta/zeta. We also have found that an active site-containing domain of RPTP beta/zeta both binds beta-catenin and functionally reduces its levels of tyrosine phosphorylation when added to lysates of pervanidate-treated cells. In contrast, an (inactivating) active-site mutant of RPTP beta/zeta also binds beta-catenin but fails to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin. Finally, in parallel to its ability to inactivate endogenous RPTP beta/zeta, PTN sharply increases tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin in PTN-treated cells. The results suggest that in unstimulated cells, RPTP beta/zeta is intrinsically active and functions as an important regulator in the reciprocal control of the steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation levels of beta-catenin by tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. The results also suggest that RPTP beta/zeta is a functional receptor for PTN; PTN signals through ligand-dependent receptor inactivation of RPTP beta/zeta to increase levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin to initiate downstream signaling. PTN is the first natural ligand identified for any of the RPTP family; its identification provides a unique tool to pursue the novel signaling pathway activated by PTN and the relationship of PTN signaling with other pathways regulating beta-catenin.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a disulfide-bonded, homodimeric mucin ( approximately 250 kDa) on leukocytes that binds to P-selectin on platelets and endothelial cells during the initial steps in inflammation. Because it has been proposed that only covalently dimerized PSGL-1 can bind P-selectin, we investigated the factors controlling dimerization of PSGL-1 and re-examined whether covalent dimers are required for binding its P-selectin. Recombinant forms of PSGL-1 were created in which the single extracellular Cys (Cys(320)) was replaced with either Ser (C320S-PSGL-1) or Ala (C320A-PSGL-1). Both recombinants migrated as monomeric species of approximately 120 kDa under both nonreducing and reducing conditions on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. P-selectin bound similarly to cells expressing either wild type or mutated forms of PSGL-1 in both flow cytometric and rolling adhesion assays. Unexpectedly, chemical cross-linking studies revealed that both C320S- and C320A-PSGL-1 noncovalently associate in the plasma membrane and cross-linking generates dimeric species. Chimeric recombinants of PSGL-1 in which the transmembrane domain in PSGL-1 was replaced with the transmembrane domain of CD43 (CD43TMD-PSGL-1) could not be chemically cross-linked, suggesting that residues within the transmembrane domain of PSGL-1 are required for noncovalent association. Cells expressing CD43TMD-PSGL-1 bound P-selectin. To further address the ability of P-selectin to bind monomeric derivatives of PSGL-1, intact HL-60 cells were trypsin-treated, which generated a soluble approximately 25-kDa NH(2)-terminal fragment of PSGL-1 that bound to immobilized P-selectin. Because N-glycosylation of PSGL-1 hinders trypsin cleavage, a recombinant form of PSGL-1 was generated in which all three potential N-glycosylation sites were mutated (DeltaN-PSGL-1). Cells expressing DeltaN-PSGL-1 bound P-selectin, and trypsin treatment of the cells generated NH(2)-terminal monomeric fragments (<10 kDa) of PSGL-1 that bound to P-selectin. These results demonstrate that Cys(320)-dependent dimerization of PSGL-1 is not required for binding to P-selectin and that a small monomeric fragment of PSGL-1 is sufficient for P-selectin recognition.',\n",

Expression of ALK1 in blood vessels and mutations of the ALK1 gene in human type II hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia patients suggest that ALK1 may have an important role during vascular development. To define the function of ALK1 during development, we inactivated the ALK1 gene in mice by gene targeting. The ALK1 homozygous embryos die at midgestation, exhibiting severe vascular abnormalities characterized by excessive fusion of capillary plexes into cavernous vessels and hyperdilation of large vessels. These vascular defects are associated with enhanced expression of angiogenic factors and proteases and are characterized by deficient differentiation and recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells. The blood vessel defects in ALK1-deficient mice are reminiscent of mice lacking TGF-beta1, TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaR-II), or endoglin, suggesting that ALK1 may mediate TGF-beta1 signal in endothelial cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that ALK1 in endothelial cells binds to TGF-beta1 and TbetaR-II. Furthermore, the ALK1 signaling pathway can inhibit TGF-beta1-dependent transcriptional activation mediated by the known TGF-beta1 type I receptor, ALK5. Taken together, our results suggest that the balance between the ALK1 and ALK5 signaling pathways in endothelial cells plays a crucial role in determining vascular endothelial properties during angiogenesis.',\n",

The PEN5 epitope creates on PSGL-1 a unique binding site for L-selectin, which is independent of PSGL-1 tyrosine sulfation. On the surface of NK cells, the expression of PEN5 is coordinated with the disappearance of L-selectin and the up-regulation of Killer cell Ig-like Receptors (KIR).

CCR10 is not expressed by keratinocytes and is instead expressed by melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and dermal microvascular endothelial cells. CCR10 was also detected in T cells as well as in skin-derived Langerhans cells. Taken together, these observations suggest a role for this novel ligand/receptor pair in both skin homeostasis as well as a potential role in inflammatory responses.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Two G protein-coupled receptors (Edg-2) and (Edg-4) for the lysolipid phosphoric acid mediator lysophosphatidic acid have been described by molecular cloning. However, the calcium-mobilizing receptor Edg-4 is not expressed in some cell lines that exhibit robust calcium responses to this ligand, thus predicting the existence of additional receptor subtypes. We report here on the characterization of a third human lysophosphatidic acid receptor subtype, Edg-7, which mediates lysophosphatidic acid-evoked calcium mobilization. In a rat hepatoma Rh7777 cell line that lacks endogenous responses to lysophosphatidic acid, this lipid mediator, but not others, evokes calcium transients when the cells have been transfected with Edg-7 or Edg-4 DNAs. Furthermore, frog oocytes exhibit a calcium-mediated chloride conductance in response to mammalian-selective lysophosphatidic acid mimetics after injection of Edg-7 mRNA. Edg-7-expressing Rh7777 cells do not show inhibition of forskolin-driven rises in cAMP in response to lysophosphatidic acid. However, membranes from HEK293T cells cotransfected with Edg-7 and G(i2)alpha protein DNAs show lysophosphatidic acid dose-dependent increases in [gamma-(35)S]GTP binding with an EC(50) value of 195 nM. When we used this assay to compare various synthetic LPA analogs at Edg-2, Edg-4, and Edg-7 receptors, we found that ethanolamine-based compounds, which are full LPA mimetics at Edg-2 and Edg-4, exhibit little activity at the Edg-7 receptor. Edg-7 RNA was detected in extracts of several rat and human tissues including prostate. Together, our data indicate that Edg-7 is a third lysophosphatidic acid receptor that couples predominantly to G(q/11)alpha proteins.',\n",

In this study, we determined if GM-CSF interacts with syndecans, a family of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Human primary osteoblasts were found to express syndecan-2 and -4 but few syndecan-1 transcripts and proteins. Recombinant human GM-CSF coupled to biotin was found to bind to syndecan-2. Immunocytochemical transmission electron microscope analysis showed co-localization of syndecan-2 and GM-CSF at the cell membrane surface. Syndecan-2 also co-localized at the cell surface and co-immunoprecipitated with the GM-CSF receptor alpha chain, suggesting a strong interaction between the cytokine, its receptor, and syndecan-2. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in syndecan-2 associated with the alpha chain of the GM-CSF receptor was increased after cell stimulation by GM-CSF. Antisense oligonucleotides that reduced specifically the expression of syndecan-2 inhibited the mitogenic activity of GM-CSF and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 induced by the cytokine. Our results indicate functional interactions between syndecan-2 and GM-CSF in osteoblasts, and we propose that syndecan-2 plays a role as a co-receptor for this cytokine.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Chemokines mediate their diverse activities through G protein-coupled receptors. The human homolog of the bovine orphan receptor PPR1 shares significant similarity to chemokine receptors. Transfection of this receptor into murine L1.2 cells resulted in responsiveness to monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-4, MCP-2, and MCP-1 in chemotaxis assays. Binding studies with radiolabeled MCP-4 demonstrated a single high affinity binding site with an IC(50) of 0.14 nM. As shown by competition binding, other members of the MCP family also recognized this receptor. MCP-2 was the next most potent ligand, with an IC(50) of 0.45 nM. Surprisingly, eotaxin (IC(50) = 6.7 nM) and MCP-3 (IC(50) = 4.1 nM) bind with greater affinity than MCP-1 (IC(50) = 10.7 nM) but only act as agonists in chemotaxis assays at 100-fold higher concentrations. Because of high affinity binding and functional chemotactic responses, we have termed this receptor CCR11. The gene for CCR11 was localized to human chromosome 3q22, which is distinct from most CC chemokine receptor genes at 3p21. Northern blot hybridization was used to identify CCR11 expression in heart, small intestine, and lung. Thus CCR11 shares functional similarity to CCR2 because it recognizes members of the MCP family, but CCR11 has a distinct expression pattern.',\n",

Furthermore, heparin alone induced receptor oligomerization on the surface of the receptor coupled chip.

We studied here the binding site in ICAM-5 for CD11a/CD18. Protein constructs containing the first immunoglobulin domain of ICAM-5 were able to support CD11a/CD18 interaction, while deletion of the first domain abolished binding. Monoclonal antibodies reacting with the first domain of ICAM-5 also completely blocked the interaction. The soluble first domain of ICAM-5 inhibited the binding of T cells to immobilized ICAM-5 at concentrations of 50 nM and higher. Interestingly, the sixth domain of ICAM-5 was also able to support leukocyte binding, but this binding activity may not involve leukocyte integrins. To test the involvement of ICAM-5 in leukocyte-neuron interactions, an assay using human T cells binding to rat hippocampal neurons was established. This binding was blocked by monoclonal antibodies against CD11a/CD18 and ICAM-5. Thus ICAM-5 may act as a major adhesion molecule for leukocyte binding to neurons in the central nervous system.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have isolated a novel cell-cell adhesion system localized at cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs). This system consists of at least nectin, a Ca(2+)-independent immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecule, and afadin, an actin filament-binding protein, that connects nectin to the actin cytoskeleton. Nectin constitutes a family consisting of two members, nectin-1 and -2. We have isolated here a third member of the nectin family and named it nectin-3. Nectin-3 has three splicing variants, nectin-3alpha (biggest), -3beta (middle), and -3gamma (smallest). Like nectin-1 and -2, nectin-3alpha consists of three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic region with the C-terminal consensus motif for binding to the PDZ domain. Nectin-3alpha formed a cis-homo-dimer and showed Ca(2+)-independent trans-homo-interaction to cause homophilic cell-cell adhesion. Nectin-3alpha furthermore showed trans-hetero-interaction with nectin-1 or -2 but did not form a cis-hetero-dimer with nectin-1 or -2. Nectin-1 did not show trans-hetero-interaction with nectin-2. The affinity of trans-hetero-interaction of nectin-3alpha with nectin-1 or -2 was higher than that of trans-homo-interaction of nectin-1, -2, or -3alpha. Nectin-2 and -3 were ubiquitously expressed, whereas nectin-1 was abundantly expressed in brain. Nectin-3alpha was colocalized with nectin-2 at cadherin-based AJs and interacted with afadin.

       "  'Abstract': 'Activins and inhibins, structurally related members of the TGF-beta superfamily of growth and differentiation factors, are mutually antagonistic regulators of reproductive and other functions. Activins bind specific type II receptor serine kinases (ActRII or IIB) to promote the recruitment and phosphorylation of the type I receptor serine kinase, ALK4 (refs 7-9), which then regulates gene expression by activating Smad proteins. Inhibins also bind type II activin receptors but do not recruit ALK4, providing a competitive model for the antagonism of activin by inhibin. Inhibins fail to antagonize activin in some tissues and cells, however, suggesting that additional components are required for inhibin action. Here we show that the type III TGF-beta receptor, betaglycan, can function as an inhibin co-receptor with ActRII. Betaglycan binds inhibin with high affinity and enhances binding in cells co-expressing ActRII and betaglycan. Inhibin also forms crosslinked complexes with both recombinant and endogenously expressed betaglycan and ActRII. Finally, betaglycan confers inhibin sensitivity to cell lines that otherwise respond poorly to this hormone. The ability of betaglycan to facilitate inhibin antagonism of activin provides a variation on the emerging roles of proteoglycans as co-receptors modulating ligand-receptor sensitivity, selectivity and function.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'All members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family contain at least one copy of the NPXY sequence within their cytoplasmic tails. For the LDL receptor, it has been demonstrated that the NPXY motif serves as a signal for rapid endocytosis through coated pits. Thus, it is generally believed that the NPXY sequences function as endocytosis signals for all the LDL receptor family members. The primary aim of this study is to define the endocytosis signal(s) within the cytoplasmic tail of LDL receptor-related protein (LRP). By using LRP minireceptors, which mimic the function and trafficking of full-length endogenous LRP, we demonstrate that the YXXL motif, but not the two NPXY motifs, serves as the dominant signal for LRP endocytosis. We also found that the distal di-leucine motif within the LRP tail contributes to its endocytosis, and its function is independent of the YXXL motif. Although the proximal NPXY motif and the proximal di-leucine motif each play a limited role in LRP endocytosis in the context of the full-length tail, these motifs were functional within the truncated receptor tail. In addition, we show that LRP minireceptor mutants defective in endocytosis signal(s) accumulate at the cell surface and are less efficient in delivery of ligand for degradation.',\n",

We report that human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells express the a17 and a22 splice forms of the np-2 receptor. Both np-2 forms bind VEGF(165) with high affinity in the presence of heparin (K(D) 1.3 x 10(-10) m) but not VEGF(121). np-2 also binds the heparin-binding form of placenta growth factor. These binding characteristics resemble those of np-1. VEGF(145) is a secreted heparin binding VEGF form that contains the peptide encoded by exon 6 of VEGF but not the peptide encoded by exon 7, which is present in VEGF(165). VEGF(145) binds to np-2 with high affinity (K(D) 7 x 10(-10) m). Surprisingly, VEGF(145) did not bind to np-1. Indeed, VEGF(145) does not bind to MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which predominantly express np-1. By contrast, VEGF(145) binds to human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells, which express both np-1 and np-2. The binding of VEGF(165) to porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing recombinant np-2 did not affect the proliferation or migration of the cells. Nevertheless, it is possible that VEGF-induced np-2-mediated signaling will take place only in the presence of other VEGF receptors such as VEGF receptor-1 or VEGF receptor-2.',\n",

BK or its ACE-resistant analogue were the agonists. All activities (arachidonic acid release and calcium mobilization) were blocked by the B(2) antagonist HOE 140. B(2) was desensitized by repeated administration of BK but resensitized to agonist by ACE inhibitors in the cells expressing both B(2) and either WT-ACE or Cyt-del-ACE. In GPI-ACE expressing cells, the B(2) receptor was still activated by the agonists, but ACE inhibitors did not resensitize. Pretreatment with filipin returned the sensitivity to inhibitors. In immunocytochemistry, GPI-ACE showed patchy, uneven distribution on the plasma membrane that was restored by filipin. Thus, ACE inhibitors were inactive as long as GPI-ACE was sequestered in cholesterol-rich membrane domains. WT-ACE and B(2) receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells co-immunoprecipitated with antibody to receptor, suggesting an interaction on the cell membrane. ACE inhibitors augment BK effects on receptors indirectly only when enzyme and receptor molecules are sterically close, possibly forming a heterodimer.',\n",

The membrane-anchored form of HB-EGF (proHB-EGF) is mitogenically active to neighboring cells as well as being a precursor of the soluble form. In addition to its mitogenic activity, proHB-EGF has the property of binding to diphtheria toxin (DT), serving as the specific receptor for DT. Tetramembrane-spanning protein CD9, a member of the TM4 superfamily, is physically associated with proHB-EGF at the cell surface and up-regulates both mitogenic and DT binding activities of proHB-EGF. To understand this up-regulation mechanism, we studied essential regions of both CD9 and proHB-EGF for up-regulation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that not only CD9 but also other TM4 proteins including CD63, CD81, and CD82 associate with proHB-EGF on the cell surface. However, these TM4 proteins did not up-regulate DT binding activity of proHB-EGF. Transfection of a series of chimeric constructs comprising CD9 and CD81 showed that the major extracellular domain of CD9 is essential for up-regulation. Assays of DT binding activity and juxtacrine mitogenic activity of the deletion mutants of proHB-EGF and chimeric molecules, derived from proHB-EGF and TGF-alpha, showed that the essential domain of proHB-EGF for up-regulation is the EGF-like domain. These results indicate that the interaction of the extracellular domains of both molecules is important for up-regulation.',\n",

A novel type I transmembrane protein, identified in an EST data base by homology to IL-17R, was found to bind specifically IL-17B, as determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis, flow cytometry, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Readily detectable transcription of IL-17BR was restricted to human kidney, pancreas, liver, brain, and intestines and only a few of the many cell lines tested. By using a rodent ortholog of IL-17BR as a probe, IL-17BR message was found to be drastically up-regulated during intestinal inflammation elicited by indomethacin treatment in rats. In addition, intraperitoneal injection of IL-17B purified from Chinese hamster ovary cells caused marked neutrophil migration in normal mice, in a specific and dose-dependent manner.

In this work we show that the disintegrin-like domain of ADAM 23 produced in Escherichia coli and immobilized on culture dishes promotes attachment of different human cells of neural origin, such as neuroblastoma cells (NB100 and SH-S(y)5(y)) or astrocytoma cells (U373 and U87 MG). Analysis of ADAM 23 binding to integrins revealed a specific interaction with alphavbeta3, mediated by a short amino acid sequence present in its putative disintegrin loop. This sequence lacks any RGD motif, which is a common structural determinant supporting alphavbeta3-mediated interactions of diverse proteins, including other disintegrins. alphavbeta3 also supported adhesion of HeLa cells transfected with a full-length cDNA for ADAM 23, extending the results obtained with the recombinant protein containing the disintegrin domain of ADAM 23. On the basis of these results, we propose that ADAM 23, through its disintegrin-like domain, may function as an adhesion molecule involved in alphavbeta3-mediated cell interactions occurring in normal and pathological processes, including progression of malignant tumors from neural origin.',\n",

Fgf8 is thought to mediate this organizer function. In addition to Fgf8, Fgf17 and Fgf18 are also expressed in the MHB junction. Fgf17 is expressed later and broader than either Fgf8 or Fgf18. Disrupting the Fgf17 gene in the mouse decreased precursor cell proliferation in the medial cerebellar (vermis) anlage after E11.5. Loss of an additional copy of Fgf8 enhanced the phenotype and accelerated its onset, demonstrating that both molecules cooperate to regulate the size of the precursor pool of cells that develop into the cerebellar vermis. However, expression patterns of Wnt1, En2, Pax5 and Otx2 were not altered suggesting that specification and patterning of MHB tissue was not perturbed and that these FGFs are not required to pattern the vermis at this stage of development. The consequence of this developmental defect is a progressive, dose-dependent loss of the most anterior lobe of the vermis in mice lacking Fgf17 and in mice lacking Fgf17 and one copy of Fgf8. Significantly, the differentiation of anterior vermis neuroepithelium was shifted rostrally and medially demonstrating that FGF also regulates the polarized progression of differentiation in the vermis anlage.

We now report the presence and biological activity of endothelin (ET)-1 in this GnRH-secreting neuronal cell. By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we found gene and protein expression of ET-1 and its converting enzyme ECE-1 in both fetal olfactory mucosa and FNC-B4 cells. The presence of authentic ET-1 in the conditioned media of FNC-B4 cells was further supported by combined RIAs and high-performance liquid chromatography studies. Experiments with radiolabeled ET-1 and ET-3 strongly indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites, corresponding to the ETA (16,500 sites/cell) and the ETB receptors (8,700 sites/cell). Functional studies, using selective analogs, indicated that these two classes of receptors subserve distinct functions in human GnRH-secreting cells. The ETA receptor subtype mediated an increase in intracellular calcium and GnRH secretion. Conversely, stimulation of the ETB subtype induced DNA synthesis and mitogen-activated protein kinase p44ERK1 expression. This is the first demonstration, in a human in vitro model, of a neuroendocrine role for ET-1 as regulator of GnRH-secreting neuron activity.',\n",

These studies identified a family of antagonists, spiropiperidines. One of the more potent compounds blocks MCP-1 binding to CCR2 with a K(d) of 60 nm, but it is unable to block binding to CXCR1, CCR1, or CCR3. These compounds were effective inhibitors of chemotaxis toward MCP-1 but were very poor inhibitors of CCR1-mediated chemotaxis. The compounds are effective blockers of MCP-1-driven inhibition of adenylate cyclase and MCP-1- and MCP-3-driven cytosolic calcium influx; the compounds are not agonists for these pathways. We showed that glutamate 291 (Glu(291)) of CCR2 is a critical residue for high affinity binding and that this residue contributes little to MCP-1 binding to CCR2. The basic nitrogen present in the spiropiperidine compounds may be the interaction partner for Glu(291), because the basicity of this nitrogen was essential for affinity; furthermore, a different class of antagonists, a class that does not have a basic nitrogen (2-carboxypyrroles), were not affected by mutations of Glu(291). In addition to the CCR2 receptor, spiropiperidine compounds have affinity for several biogenic amine receptors. Receptor models indicate that the acidic residue, Glu(291), from transmembrane-7 of CCR2 is in a position similar to the acidic residue contributed from transmembrane-3 of biogenic amine receptors, which may account for the shared affinity of spiropiperidines for these two receptor classes. The models suggest that the acid-base pair, Glu(291) to piperidine nitrogen, anchors the spiropiperidine compound within the transmembrane ovoid bundle. This binding site may overlap with the space required by MCP-1 during binding and signaling; thus the small molecule ligands act as antagonists. An acidic residue in transmembrane region 7 is found in most chemokine receptors and is rare in other serpentine receptors. The model of the binding site may suggest ways to make new small molecule chemokine receptor antagonists, and it may rationalize the design of more potent and selective antagonists.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The present study provides direct evidence that syndecan 2 participates selectively in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1 through specific binding of its heparan sulfate side chains to the fibronectin substrate. Our previous study with Lewis lung carcinoma-derived P29 cells demonstrated that the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which binds to fibronectin, is syndecan 2 (N. Itano et al., 1996, Biochem. J. 315, 925-930). We here report that in vitro treatment of the cells by antisense oligonucleotide for syndecan 2 resulted in a failure to form stress fibers on fibronectin substrate in association with specific suppression of its cell surface expression. Instead, localization of actin filaments in the cytoplasmic cortex occurred. A similar response of the cells was observed when the cells were treated to eliminate functions of cell surface heparan sulfates, including exogenous addition of heparin and pretreatment with anti-heparan sulfate antibody, F58-10E4, and with proteinase-free heparitinase I. Size- and structure-defined oligosaccharides prepared from heparin and chemically modified heparins were utilized as competitive inhibitors to examine the structural characteristics of the cell surface heparan sulfates involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Their affinity chromatography on a column linked with a recombinant H-271 peptide containing a C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin demonstrated that 2-O-sulfated iduronates were essential for the binding. Inhibition studies revealed that a heparin-derived dodecasaccharide sample enriched with an IdoA(2OS)-GlcNS(6OS) disaccharide completely blocked binding of the syndecan 2 ectodomain to immobilized H-271 peptide. Finally, the dodecasaccharide sample was shown to inhibit stress fiber formation, triggered by adhesion of P29 cells to a CH-271 polypeptide consisting of both the RGD cell-binding and the C-terminal heparin-binding domains of fibronectin in a fused form. All these results consistently suggest that syndecan 2 proteoglycan interacts with the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin at the highly sulfated cluster(s), such as [IdoA(2OS)-GlcNS(6OS)](6) present in its heparan sulfate chains, to result in the induction of stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin alpha5beta1.',\n",

TSP-1 binds to a number of different cellular receptors via different domains of the molecule and several short receptor-binding sequences have been identified within the TSP-1 molecule. In this study, we have used synthetic peptides representing these various sequences in order to identify the cellular receptor and TSP domain responsible for stimulation of resorption. We show that one peptide CSVTCG, which represents the CD36-binding region of TSP-1, stimulates resorption in a fashion similar to the intact molecule, while the peptides RGDS, RFYVVMWK, and RFYVVM, representing other cell-binding domains of TSP, have no effect on resorption. Using RT-PCR and immunoblotting, we further demonstrate expression of CD36 in human osteoclastoma (giant cell tumour), primary human bone derived cells, and clonal osteoblastic cells. These studies suggest that CD36 is involved in regulation of resorption by osteoclasts and is the receptor responsible for the resorption-promoting effects of TSP-1.',\n",

When apelin-36 and its pyroglutamylated C-terminal peptide, [<Glu(65)]apelin-13, were compared in microphysiometric analyses, the elevation of extracellular acidification induced in cells expressing APJ by [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 was transient, whereas that by apelin-36 was sustained.

(125)I -Labeled [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 analogue specifically bound to APJ with a high affinity, and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 was more potent than apelin-36 in competitive inhibition assays. Because pretreatment with apelin-36 but not [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 drastically reduced the binding of the labeled apelin to APJ, the different patterns of acidification induced by these two peptides appeared to reflect their dissociation rather than association with APJ. Apelin elicited the migration of APJ-expressing cells, and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 was more potent than apelin-36 in this activity. Heterogeneous molecular forms of apelin corresponding to apelin-36 and [<Glu(65)]apelin-13 were produced in bovine colostrum.

OPC-51803 and dDAVP displaced [(3)H]-AVP binding to human V(2)- and V(1a)-receptors with K(i) values of 91.9+/-10.8 nM (n = 6) and 3.12+/-0.38 nM (n = 6) for V(2)-receptors, and 819+/-39 nM (n = 6) and 41.5+/-9.9 nM (n = 6) for V(1a)-receptors, indicating that OPC-51803 was about nine times more selective for V(2)-receptors, similar to the selectivity of dDAVP. OPC-51803 scarcely displaced [(3)H]-AVP binding to human V(1b)-receptors even at 10(-4) M, while dDAVP showed potent affinity to human V(1b)-receptors with the K(i) value of 13.7+/-3.2 nM (n = 4). OPC-51803 concentration-dependently increased cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production in HeLa cells expressing human V(2)-receptors with an EC(50) value of 189+/-14 nM (n = 6). The concentration-response curve for cyclic AMP production induced by OPC-51803 was shifted to the right in the presence of a V(2)-antagonist, OPC-31260. At 10(-5) M, OPC-51803 did not increase the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in HeLa cells expressing human V(1a)-receptors.

From these results, OPC-51803 has been confirmed to be the first nonpeptide agonist for human AVP V(2)-receptors without agonistic activities for V(1a)- and V(1b)-receptors. OPC-51803 may be useful for the treatment of AVP-deficient pathophysiological states and as a tool for AVP researches.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have previously shown that, although overexpression of mutant dynamin inhibits clathrin-dependent endocytosis and disrupts high affinity binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the EGF receptor (EGFR), it does not inhibit ligand-induced translocation of the EGFR into clathrin-coated pits. In the present study, we demonstrate that, upon ligand binding and incubation at 37 degrees C, the EGFR was polyubiquitinated regardless of overexpression of mutant dynamin. In cells not overexpressing mutant dynamin, the EGFR was rapidly internalized and deubiquitinated. In cells being endocytosis-deficient, due to overexpression of mutant dynamin, however, the EGFR was upon prolonged chase first found in deeply invaginated coated pits, and then eventually moved out of the coated pits and back onto the smooth plasma membrane. Polyubiquitination occurred equally efficiently in cells with or without intact clathrin-dependent endocytosis, while the kinetics of ubiquitination and deubiquitination was somewhat different. We further found that the EGF-induced ubiquitination of Eps15 occurred both in the absence and presence of endocytosis with the same kinetics as polyubiquitination of the EGFR, but that the EGF-induced monoubiquitination of Eps15 was somewhat reduced upon overexpression of mutant dynamin. Our data show that EGF-induced polyubiquitination of the EGFR occurs at the plasma membrane.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'LIGHT is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily member, which binds two known cellular receptors, lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTbetaR) and the herpesvirus entry mediator (HveA). LIGHT is a homotrimer that activates proapoptotic and integrin-inducing pathways. Receptor binding residues via LIGHT were identified by introducing point mutations in the A\\' --> A\" and D --> E loops of LIGHT, which altered binding to LTbetaR and HveA. One mutant of LIGHT exhibits selective binding to HveA and is inactive triggering cell death in HT29.14s cells or induction of ICAM-1 in fibroblasts. Studies with HveA- or LTbetaR-specific antibodies further indicated that HveA does not contribute, either cooperatively or by direct signaling, to the death pathway activated by LIGHT. LTbetaR, not HveA, recruits TNF receptor-associated factor-3 (TRAF3), and LIGHT-induced death is blocked by a dominant negative TRAF3 mutant. Together, these results indicate that TRAF3 recruitment propagates death signals initiated by LIGHT-LTbetaR interaction and implicates a distinct biological role for LIGHT-HveA system.',\n",

Here we identify two receptors for zTNF4 and demonstrate a relationship between zTNF4 and autoimmune disease. Transgenic animals overexpressing zTNF4 in lymphoid cells develop symptoms characteristic of systemic lupus erythaematosus (SLE) and expand a rare population of splenic B-Ia lymphocytes. In addition, circulating zTNF4 is more abundant in NZBWF1 and MRL-lpr/lpr mice during the onset and progression of SLE. We have identified two TNF receptor family members, TACI and BCMA, that bind zTNF4. Treatment of NZBWF1 mice with soluble TACI-Ig fusion protein inhibits the development of proteinuria and prolongs survival of the animals. These findings demonstrate the involvement of zTNF4 and its receptors in the development of SLE and identify TACI-Ig as a promising treatment of autoimmune disease in humans.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The widespread neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has two receptors VPAC(1) and VPAC(2). Solid-phase syntheses of VIP analogs in which each amino acid has been changed to alanine (Ala scan) or glycine was achieved and each analog was tested for: (i) three-dimensional structure by ab initio molecular modeling; (ii) ability to inhibit (125)I-VIP binding (K(i)) and to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity (EC(50)) in membranes from cell clones stably expressing human recombinant VPAC(1) or VPAC(2) receptor. The data show that substituting residues at 14 positions out of 28 in VIP resulted in a >10-fold increase of K(i) or EC(50) at the VPAC(1) receptor. Modeling of the three-dimensional structure of native VIP (central alpha-helice from Val(5) to Asn(24) with random coiled N and C terminus) and analogs shows that substitutions of His(1), Val(5), Arg(14), Lys(15), Lys(21), Leu(23), and Ile(26) decreased biological activity without altering the predicted structure, supporting that those residues directly interact with VPAC(1) receptor. The interaction of the analogs with human VPAC(2) receptor is similar to that observed with VPAC(1) receptor, with three remarkable exceptions: substitution of Thr(11) and Asn(28) by alanine increased K(i) for binding to VPAC(2) receptor; substitution of Tyr(22) by alanine increased EC(50) for stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity through interaction with the VPAC(2) receptor. By combining 3 mutations at positions 11, 22, and 28, we developed the [Ala(11,22,28)]VIP analog which constitutes the first highly selective (>1,000-fold) human VPAC(1) receptor agonist derived from VIP ever described.',\n",

However, the molecular identity of this myocardial PLD and the mechanisms that regulate it are not well understood. Using subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis, we found that PLD2 is the major myocardial PLD and that it localizes primarily to sarcolemmal membranes. A 100-kDa PLD2-interacting cardiac protein was detected using a protein overlay assay employing purified PLD2 and then identified as alpha-actinin using peptide-mass fingerprinting with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy. The direct association between PLD2 and alpha-actinin was confirmed using an in vitro binding assay and localized to PLD2's N-terminal 185 amino acids. Purified alpha-actinin potently inhibits PLD2 activity (IC(50) = 80 nm) in an interaction-dependent and ADP-ribosylation factor-reversible manner. Finally, alpha-actinin co-localizes with actin and with PLD2 in the detergent-insoluble fraction from sarcolemmal membranes. These results suggest that PLD2 is reciprocally regulated in sarcolemmal membranes by alpha-actinin and ARF1 and accordingly that a major role for PLD2 in cardiac function may involve reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.\",\n",

The biochemical mechanism leading to this clinical observation is unknown. We have previously reported high molecular weight kininogen (HK) inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by binding to the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex. Although factor XII will bind to the intact platelet through GP Ibalpha (glycocalicin) without activation, we now report that factor XIIa (0. 37 microm), but not factor XII zymogen, is required for the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XIIa had no significant effect on SFLLRN-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover, an antibody to the thrombin site on protease-activated receptor-1 failed to block factor XII binding to platelets. Inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was demonstrated with factor XIIa but not with factor XII zymogen or factor XIIf, indicating that the conformational exposure of the heavy chain following proteolytic activation is required for inhibition. However, inactivation of the catalytic activity of factor XIIa did not affect the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XII showed displacement of biotin-labeled HK (30 nm) binding to gel-filtered platelets and, at concentrations of 50 nm, was able to block 50% of the HK binding, suggesting involvement of the GP Ib complex. Antibodies to GP Ib and GP IX, which inhibited HK binding to platelets, did not block factor XII binding. However, using a biosensor, which monitors protein-protein interactions, both HK and factor XII bind to GP Ibalpha. Factor XII may serve to regulate thrombin binding to the GP Ib receptor by co-localizing with HK, to control the extent of platelet aggregation in vivo.',\n",

Using phage display, we have cloned a gene that appears to recognize phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. Here we show that this gene, when transfected into B and T lymphocytes, enables them to recognize and engulf apoptotic cells in a phosphatidylserine-specific manner. Flow cytometric analysis using a monoclonal antibody suggested that the protein is expressed on the surface of macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells; this antibody, like phosphatidylserine liposomes, inhibited the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and, in macrophages, induced an anti-inflammatory state. This candidate phosphatidylserine receptor is highly homologous to genes of unknown function in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that phosphatidylserine recognition on apoptotic cells during their removal by phagocytes is highly conserved throughout phylogeny.',\n",

Affected children invariably die of mycobacterial infection, unless bone marrow transplantation is undertaken. Pathogenic IFNGR1 mutations identified to date include nonsense and splice mutations and frameshift deletions and insertions. All result in a premature stop codon upstream from the segment encoding the transmembrane domain, precluding cell surface expression of the receptors. We report herein two sporadic and two familial cases of a novel form of complete IFNgammaR1 deficiency in which normal numbers of receptors are detected at the cell surface. Two in-frame deletions and two missense IFNGR1 mutations were identified in the segment encoding the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the receptor. Eight independent IFNgammaR1-specific mAb's, including seven blocking antibodies, gave recognition patterns that differed between patients, suggesting that different epitopes were altered by the mutations. No specific binding of (125)I-IFN-gamma to cells was observed in any patient, however, and the cells failed to respond to IFN-gamma. The mutations therefore cause complete IFNgammaR1 deficiency by disrupting the IFN-gamma-binding site without affecting surface expression. The detection of surface IFNgammaR1 molecules by specific antibodies, including blocking antibodies, does not exclude a diagnosis of complete IFNgammaR1 deficiency.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is expressed in glial cells within the central and peripheral nervous systems. CNTF stimulates gene expression, cell survival or differentiation in a variety of neuronal cell types such as sensory, sympathetic, ciliary and motor neurons. In addition, effects of CNTF on oligodendrocytes as well as denervated and intact skeletal muscle have been documented. CNTF itself lacks a classical signal peptide sequence of a secreted protein, but is thought to convey its cytoprotective effects after release from adult glial cells by some mechanism induced by injury. Interestingly, mice that are homozygous for an inactivated CNTF gene develop normally and initially thrive. Only later in adulthood do they exhibit a mild loss of motor neurons with resulting muscle weakness, leading to the suggestion that CNTF is not essential for neural development, but instead acts in response to injury or other stresses. The CNTF receptor complex is most closely related to, and shares subunits with the receptor complexes for interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor. The specificity conferring alpha subunit of the CNTF complex (CNTFR alpha), is extremely well conserved across species, and has a distribution localized predominantly to the nervous system and skeletal muscle. CNTFR alpha lacks a conventional transmembrane domain and is thought to be anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. Mice lacking CNTFR alpha die perinatally, perhaps indicating the existence of a second developmentally important CNTF-like ligand. Signal transduction by CNTF requires that it bind first to CNTFR alpha, permitting the recruitment of gp130 and LIFR beta, forming a tripartite receptor complex. CNTF-induced heterodimerization of the beta receptor subunits leads to tyrosine phosphorylation (through constitutively associated JAKs), and the activated receptor provides docking sites for SH2-containing signaling molecules, such as STAT proteins. Activated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to bind specific DNA sequences, resulting in enhanced transcription of responsive genes. The neuroprotective effects of CNTF have been demonstrated in a number of in vitro cell models as well as in vivo in mutant mouse strains which exhibit motor neuron degeneration. Intracerebral administration of CNTF and CNTF analogs has also been shown to protect striatal output neurons in rodent and primate models of Huntington's disease. Treatment of humans and animals with CNTF is also known to induce weight loss characterized by a preferential loss of body fat. When administered systemically, CNTF activates downstream signaling molecules such as STAT-3 in areas of the hypothalamus which regulate food intake.

We describe here the characterization of a membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of which the cDNA sequence was recently reported, encoding the mouse homologue of the human coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (mCAR). Western and Northern blot analyses demonstrated the abundant expression of mCAR in the mouse brain, the highest level being observed in the newborn mouse brain, and its expression was detected in embryos as early as at 10. 5 days post-coitus (dpc), but decreased rapidly after birth. On in situ hybridization, mCAR mRNA expression was observed throughout the newborn mouse brain. In primary neurons from the hippocampi of mouse embryos the expression of mCAR was observed throughout the cells including those in growth cones on immunohistochemistry. In order to determine whether or not mCAR is involved in cell adhesion, aggregation assays were carried out. C6 cells transfected with mCAR cDNA aggregated homophilically, which was inhibited by specific antibodies against the extracellular domain of mCAR. In addition to its action as a virus receptor, mCAR may function naturally as an adhesion molecule involved in neuro-network formation in the developing nervous system.',\n",

G-361 cells utilize two additional integrins, alpha(9)beta(1) and alpha(5)beta(1) to adhere to tTG. Furthermore, blood coagulation factor XIII (FXIII), another member of the transglutaminase family that is highly homologous to tTG, and propolypeptide of von Willebrand factor (pp-vWF) also promoted cell adhesion through alpha(9)beta(1) or alpha(4)beta(1) in G-361 or MOLT-3 cells, respectively. In the case of pp-vWF, alpha(9)beta(1) and alpha(4)beta(1) both bind to the same site, comprised of 15 amino acid residues and designated T2-15. Moreover, SW480 human colon cancer cells stably transfected to express alpha(9)beta(1), but not mock transfectants, adhered to tTG, FXIII, pp-vWF, and T2-15/bovine serum albumin conjugate. These data identify tTG, FXIII, and pp-vWF as shared ligands for the integrins alpha(9)beta(1) and alpha(4)beta(1).

Two CRF receptors, encoded by distinct genes, CRF-R1 and CRF-R2, and that can exist in two alternatively spliced forms, have been cloned. The type-1 receptor is expressed in many areas of the rodent brain, as well as in the pituitary, gonads, and skin. In the rodent, one splice variant of the type-2 receptor, CRF-R2 alpha, is expressed mainly in the brain, whereas the other variant, CRF-R2 beta, is found not only in the CNS, but also in cardiac and skeletal muscle, epididymis, and the gastrointestinal tract. The poor correlation between the sites of expression of CRF-R2 and CRF, as well as the relatively low affinity of CRF for CRF-R2, suggested the presence of another ligand, whose existence was confirmed in our cloning of urocortin. This CRF-like peptide is found not only in brain, but also in peripheral sites, such as lymphocytes. The broad tissue distribution of CRF receptors and their ligands underscores the important role of this system in maintenance of homeostasis. Functional studies of the two receptor types reveal differences in the specificity for CRF and related ligands. On the basis of its greater affinity for urocortin, in comparison with CRF, as well as its brain distribution, CRF-R2 may be the cognate receptor for urocortin. Mutagenesis studies of CRF receptors directed toward understanding the basis for their specificity, provide insight into the structural determinants for hormone-receptor recognition and signal transduction.',\n",

We previously demonstrated that gp17 binds to CD4 with high affinity and strongly inhibits T lymphocyte apoptosis induced by sequential cross-linking of CD4 and T cell receptor (TCR). To further characterize the gp17/CD4 interaction and map the gp17 binding site, we produced a secreted form of recombinant gp17 fused to human IgG1 Fc, gp17-Ig. We showed that gp17-Ig exhibits a binding affinity for CD4 similar to that of native gp17. As no information about gp17 structure is presently available, 99 overlapping gp17 peptides were synthesized by the Spot method, which allowed the mapping of two CD4 binding regions. Alanine scanning of CD4-reactive peptides identified critical residues, selected for site-directed mutagenesis. Nine gp17-Ig mutants were generated and characterized. Three residues within the carboxy-terminal region were identified as the major binding domain to CD4. The Spot method combined with mutagenesis represents a refined approach to distinguish the contact residues from the ones contributing to the conformation of the CD4-binding domain.',\n",

This novel system was used to study, by site-directed mutagenesis, the role of various amino acids in KIR binding to HLA-C ligand.

       "  'Abstract': 'The ADAMs (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease Domains) are a family of membrane-anchored proteins that play a role in fertilisation, myoblast fusion and ectodomain shedding of cell surface proteins. Meltrin gamma (ADAM-9) is a widely expressed member of this family and is involved in the shedding of heparin binding epidermal growth factor. Here we report that meltrin gamma can function as a cell adhesion molecule via its disintegrin domain. Using solid-phase binding assays and antibody inhibition experiments, we demonstrate that a murine meltrin gamma-Fc (Mel gamma -Fc) fusion protein binds to the integrin alpha(6)beta(1) on the surface of fibroblast cell lines, HT1080 and Wehi 164 in a specific manner. Since alpha(6)beta(1) is important for the motility of several cell types on laminin, cell migration studies using time-lapse video microscopy were performed. Cells adhering to Mel gamma-Fc displayed a rounded morphology and a marked increase (eight- to tenfold) in their motility compared to that on laminin. Furthermore, the p160 ROCK kinase inhibitor Y-27632 specifically reduced the migration of cells on meltrin gamma but had no effect on migration of cells on laminin, whilst the general tyrosine phoshorylation inhibitor, genistein, inhibited cell migration on both substrates. These results together suggest that meltrin gamma may play a role in regulating the motility of cells by binding to alpha(6)beta(1) integrin and this may be important during a variety of biological and pathological processes.',\n",

We performed a detailed analysis of the binding of GDNF and neurturin to their receptors and investigated the influence of cRET on the binding affinities. We show that the rate of dissociation of (125)I-GDNF from GFRalpha1 is increased in the presence of 50 nm GDNF, an effect that can be explained by the occurrence of negative cooperativity. Scatchard plots of the ligand concentration binding isotherms reveal a pronounced downward curvature at low (125)I-GDNF concentrations suggesting the presence of positive cooperativity. This effect is observed in the range of GDNF concentrations responsible for biological activity (1-20 pm) and may have an important role in cRET-independent signaling. A high affinity site with a K(D) of 11 pm for (125)I-GDNF is detected only when GFRalpha1 is co-expressed with cRET at a DNA ratio of 1:3. These results suggest an interaction of GFRalpha1 and cRET in the absence of GDNF and demonstrate that the high affinity binding can be measured only when cRET is present.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The alpha(v)beta(3) integrin has been shown to bind several ligands, including osteopontin and vitronectin. Its role in modulating cell migration and downstream signaling pathways in response to specific extracellular matrix ligands has been investigated in this study. Highly invasive prostate cancer PC3 cells that constitutively express alpha(v)beta(3) adhere and migrate on osteopontin and vitronectin in an alpha(v)beta(3)-dependent manner. However, exogenous expression of alpha(v)beta(3) in noninvasive prostate cancer LNCaP (beta(3)-LNCaP) cells mediates adhesion and migration on vitronectin but not on osteopontin. Activation of alpha(v)beta(3) by epidermal growth factor stimulation is required to mediate adhesion to osteopontin but is not sufficient to support migration on this substrate. We show that alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated cell migration requires activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) pathway since wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, prevents PC3 cell migration on both osteopontin and vitronectin; furthermore, alpha(v)beta(3) engagement by osteopontin and vitronectin activates the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway. Migration of beta(3)-LNCaP cells on vitronectin also occurs through activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway; however, AKT phosphorylation is not increased upon engagement by osteopontin. Furthermore, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), known to support cell migration in beta(3)-LNCaP cells, is detected on both substrates. Thus, in PC3 cells, alpha(v)beta(3) mediates cell migration and PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation on vitronectin and osteopontin; in beta(3)-LNCaP cells, alpha(v)beta(3) mediates cell migration and PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation on vitronectin, whereas adhesion to osteopontin does not support alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated cell migration and PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway activation. We conclude therefore that alpha(v)beta(3) exists in multiple functional states that can bind either selectively vitronectin or both vitronectin and osteopontin and that can differentially activate cell migration and intracellular signaling pathways in a ligand-specific manner.',\n",

Although both alpha(E)beta(7) and alpha(4)beta(7) utilize the beta(7) chain, they have distinct binding specificities for E-cadherin and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), respectively. We found that mutation of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in the alpha(E) A-domain (D190A) abolished E-cadherin binding, as did mutation F298A on the A-domain surface near the MIDAS cleft. A docking model of the A-domain with E-cadherin domain 1 indicates that coordination of the alpha(E) MIDAS metal ion by E-cadherin Glu(31) and a novel projection of Phe(298) into a hydrophobic pocket on E-cadherin provide the basis for the interaction. The location of the binding site on the alpha(E) A-domain resembles that on other integrins, but its structure appears distinctive and particularly adapted to recognize the tip of E-cadherin, a unique integrin ligand. Additionally, mutation of the beta(7) MIDAS motif (D140A) abolished alpha(E)beta(7) binding to E-cadherin and alpha(4)beta(7)-mediated adhesion to MAdCAM-1, and alpha(4) chain mutations that abrogated binding of alpha(4)beta(1) to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and fibronectin similarly reduced alpha(4)beta(7) interaction with MAdCAM-1.

Each laminin is a heterotrimer assembled from alpha, beta, and gamma chain subunits, secreted and incorporated into cell-associated extracellular matrices. The laminins can self-assemble, bind to other matrix macromolecules, and have unique and shared cell interactions mediated by integrins, dystroglycan, and other receptors. Through these interactions, laminins critically contribute to cell differentiation, cell shape and movement, maintenance of tissue phenotypes, and promotion of tissue survival. Recent advances in the characterization of genetic disruptions in humans, mice, nematodes and flies have revealed developmental roles for the different laminin subunits in diverse cell types, affecting differentiation from blastocyst formation to the post-natal period. These genetic defects have challenged some of the previous concepts about basement membranes and have shed new light on the diversity and complexity of laminin functions as well as established the molecular basis of several human diseases.',\n",

Guanylins activate two receptors, GC-C and OK-GC, which are expressed in intestine and/or kidney. Elevation of cGMP in the intestine elicits an increase in electrolyte and water secretion. Activation of renal receptors by uroguanylin stimulates urine flow and excretion of sodium, chloride, and potassium. Intracellular cGMP pathways for guanylins include activation of PKG-II and/or indirect stimulation of PKA-II. The result is activation of CFTR and/or C1C-2 channel proteins to enhance the electrogenic secretion of chloride and bicarbonate. Similar cellular mechanisms may be involved in the renal responses to guanylin peptides. Uroguanylin serves as an intestinal natriuretic hormone in postprandial states, thus linking the digestive and renal organ systems in a novel endocrine axis.

Based on studies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we postulated that CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) might be the receptor on the neutrophils for binding to HK/HKa. However, the direct interaction of HK/HKa and Mac-1 had not been demonstrated. We therefore transfected HEK 293 cells with human Mac-1. Cell binding assays using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled HKa showed increased binding to the Mac-1 transfected cells compared with the control transfected cells. The binding was specific because unlabeled HKa, Mac-1-specific antibody, and fibrinogen can inhibit the binding of biotin-HKa to Mac-1 transfected cells. HKa bound to Mac-1 transfected cells (20 000 molecules/cell) with a K(d) = 62 nmol/L. To demonstrate directly the formation of a complex between HKa and Mac-1, we examined the interaction of HKa and purified Mac-1 in a cell-free system using an IAsys resonant mirror optical biosensor. The association and dissociation rate constants (k(on) and k(off), respectively) were determined, and they yielded a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 3.2x10(-9) mol/L. The functional significance of direct interaction of HKa to Mac-1 was investigated by examining the effect of HKa on cellular adhesion to fibrinogen and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), molecules abundant in the injured vessel wall. HKa blocked the adhesion of Mac-1 transfected cells to fibrinogen and ICAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, HKa may interrupt Mac-1-mediated cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell adhesive interactions and may therefore influence the recruitment of circulating neutrophils/monocytes to sites of vessel injury.

To better define the basis of the ICAM-4/beta(2) integrin interaction, we have generated wild-type, domain-deleted and mutated recombinant chimeric ICAM-4-Fc proteins and analyzed their interaction in a cellular adhesion assay with LFA-1 and Mac-1 L-cell stable transfectants. We found that monoclonal antibodies against CD11a, CD11b, CD18, or LW(ab) block adhesion of transfectant L-cells to immobilized ICAM-4-Fc protein and that the ICAM-4/beta(2) integrin interaction was highly sensitive to the presence of the divalent cations Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). Deletion of individual Ig-domains D1 or D2 of the extracellular part of ICAM-4 showed that LFA-1 binds to the first Ig-like domain, whereas the Mac-1 binding site encompassed both the first and the second Ig-like domains. Based on the crystal structure of ICAM-2, we propose a model for the Ig-like domains D1 and D2 of ICAM-4. Accordingly, by site-directed mutagenesis of 22 amino acid positions spread out on all faces of the ICAM-4 molecule, we identified four exposed residues, Leu(80), Trp(93), and Arg(97) on the CFG face and Trp(77) on the E-F loop of domain D1 that may contact LFA-1 as part of the binding site. However, the single and double mutants R52E and T91Q on the CFG face of domain D1, which correspond to the key residues Glu(34) and Gln(73) for ICAM-1 binding to LFA-1, had no effect on LFA-1 binding. In contrast, all mutants on the CFG face of domain D1 and residues Glu(151) and Thr(154) in the C'-E loop of the domain D2 seem to play a dominant role in Mac-1 binding. These data suggest that the binding site for LFA-1 on ICAM-4 overlaps but is distinct from the Mac-1 binding site.\",\n",

The anti-opiate neuropeptides FF and AF (NPFF and NPAF) have been implicated in pain modulation as well as in opioid tolerance and may play a critical role in this process, although their mechanism of action has remained unknown. Here we describe a cDNA encoding a novel neuropeptide Y-like human orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), referred to as HLWAR77 for which NPAF and NPFF have high affinity. Cells transiently or stably expressing HLWAR77 bind and respond in a concentration-dependent manner to NPAF and NPFF and are also weakly activated by FMRF-amide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide) and a variety of related peptides. The high affinity and potency of human NPFF and human NPAF for HLWAR77 strongly suggest that these are the cognate ligands for this receptor. Expression of HLWAR77 was demonstrated in brain regions associated with opiate activity, consistent with the pain-modulating activity of these peptides, whereas the expression in adipose tissue suggests other physiological and pathophysiological activities for FMRF-amide neuropeptides. The discovery that the anti-opiate neuropeptides are the endogenous ligands for HLWAR77 will aid in defining the physiological role(s) of these ligands and facilitate the identification of receptor agonists and antagonists.',\n",

To test the hypothesis that the particularly prominent cell regulation by OSM is due to signals contributed by OSMRbeta, we introduced stable expression of human or mouse OSMRbeta in rat hepatoma cells which have endogenous receptors for IL-6 and LIF, but not OSM. Both mouse and human OSM engaged gp130 with their respective OSMRbeta subunits, but only human OSM also acted through LIFR. Signaling by OSMRbeta-containing receptors was characterized by highest activation of STAT5 and ERK, recruitment of the insulin receptor substrate and Jun-N-terminal kinase pathways, and induction of a characteristic pattern of acute phase proteins. Since LIF together with LIFRalpha appear to form a more stable complex with gp130 than OSM with gp130 and OSMRbeta, co-activation of LIFR and OSMR resulted in a predominant LIF-like response.

In this study, we investigated the molecular determinants of both ligand and receptor for the PTH2 receptor selectivity of TIP39 and quantitatively evaluated the role of molecular elements in the binding of TIP39 to the PTH2 and PTH1 receptors. A chimeric receptor composed of the N-terminal extracellular domain of the PTH1 receptor and the remainder (juxtamembrane domain) of the PTH2 receptor (P2-NP1) was fully activated by TIP39 (E(max) = 98% of the rPTH-(1-34), E(max), EC(50) = 2.0 nm). This receptor chimera bound TIP39 with an equivalent affinity to the wild-type PTH2 receptor (2. 3 and 2.0 nm, respectively).

Thus, the juxtamembrane receptor domain specifies the signaling and binding selectivity of TIP39 for the PTH2 receptor over the PTH1 receptor. Removing six N-terminal residues of TIP39 eliminated activation of the PTH2 receptor and reduced binding affinity 70-fold. In contrast, this truncation increased affinity for the PTH1 receptor 10-fold, reversing the PTH2/PTH1 receptor binding selectivity and resulting in a high affinity interaction of TIP-(7-39) with the PTH1 receptor (6 nm). These findings can be explained by a strong interaction between the N-terminal region of TIP39 and the juxtamembrane domain of the PTH2 receptor, with the corresponding domain of the PTH1 receptor acting as a selectivity barrier against high affinity binding of TIP39. As a result, TIP-(7-39) is a highly potent, selective antagonist for the PTH1 receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We describe a small molecule chemokine receptor antagonist, UCB35625 (the trans-isomer J113863 published by Banyu Pharmaceutical Co., patent WO98/04554), which is a potent, selective inhibitor of CCR1 and CCR3. Nanomolar concentrations of UCB35625 were sufficient to inhibit eosinophil shape change responses to MIP-1alpha, MCP-4, and eotaxin, while greater concentrations could inhibit the chemokine-induced internalization of both CCR1 and CCR3. UCB35625 also inhibited the CCR3-mediated entry of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 primary isolate 89.6 into the glial cell line, NP-2 (IC(50) = 57 nm). Chemotaxis of transfected cells expressing either CCR1 or CCR3 was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of the compound (IC(50) values of CCR1-MIP-1alpha = 9.6 nm, CCR3-eotaxin = 93.7 nm). However, competitive ligand binding assays on the same transfectants revealed that considerably larger concentrations of UCB35625 were needed for effective ligand displacement than were needed for the inhibition of receptor function. Thus, it appears that the compound may interact with a region present in both receptors that inhibits the conformational change necessary to initiate intracellular signaling. By virtue of its potency at the two major eosinophil chemokine receptors, UCB35625 is a prototypic therapy for the treatment of eosinophil-mediated inflammatory disorders, such as asthma and as an inhibitor of CCR3-mediated human immunodeficiency virus-1 entry.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have identified the PDZ domain protein AF-6 as an intracellular binding partner of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), an integral membrane protein located at cell contacts. Binding of AF-6 to JAM required the presence of the intact C terminus of JAM, which represents a classical type II PDZ domain-binding motif. Although JAM did not interact with the single PDZ domains of ZO-1 or of CASK, we found that a ZO-1 fragment containing PDZ domains 2 and 3 bound to JAM in vitro in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. AF-6 as well as ZO-1 could be coprecipitated with JAM from endothelial cell extracts, demonstrating the association of the endogenously expressed molecules in vivo. Targeting of JAM to sites of cell contacts could be affected by the loss of the PDZ domain-binding C terminus. Full-length mouse JAM co-distributed with endogenous AF-6 in human Caco-2 cells at sites of cell contact independent of whether adjacent cells expressed mouse JAM as an extracellular binding partner. In contrast, truncated JAM lacking the PDZ domain-binding C terminus did not co-distribute with endogenous AF-6, but was restricted to cell contacts between cells expressing mouse JAM. Our results suggest that JAM can be recruited to intercellular junctions by its interaction with the PDZ domain-containing proteins AF-6 and possibly ZO-1.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Wnt signalling plays a crucial role in the control of morphogenetic movements. We describe the expression and functional analyses of frizzled 7 (Xfz7) during gastrulation in Xenopus. Low levels of Xfz7 transcripts are expressed maternally during cleavage stages; its zygotic expression strongly increases at the beginning of gastrulation and is predominantly localized to the presumptive neuroectoderm and deep cells of the involuting mesoderm. Overexpression of Xfz7 in the dorsal equatorial region affects the movements of convergent extension and delays mesodermal involution. It alters the correct localization, but not the expression, of mesodermal and neural markers. These effects can be rescued by extra-Xfz7, which is a secreted form of the receptor that also weakly inhibits convergent extension when overexpressed. This suggests that the wild-type and truncated receptors have opposing effects when coexpressed and that overexpression of Xfz7 causes an increased signalling activity. Consistent with this, Xfz7 biochemically and functionally interacts with Xwnt11. In addition, Dishevelled, but not (&bgr;)-catenin, synergizes with Xfz7 to affect convergent extension. Furthermore, overexpression of Xfz7 and Xwnt11 also affects convergent extension in activin-treated animal caps, and this can be efficiently reversed by coexpression of Cdc42(T17N), a dominant negative mutant of the small GTPase Cdc42 known as a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton. Conversely, Cdc42(G12V), a constitutively active mutant, rescues the effects of extra-Xfz7 on convergent extension in a dose-dependent manner. That both gain-of-function and loss-of-function of both frizzled and dishevelled produce the same phenotype has been well described in Drosophila tissue polarity. Therefore, our results suggest an endogenous role of Xfz7 in the regulation of convergent extension during gastrulation.',\n",

Manifestations include increased blood pressure, proteinuria, coagulopathy and peripheral and cerebral oedema. Although the aetiology and pathogenesis remain to be elucidated, the placenta is undoubtedly involved, as termination of pregnancy eradicates the disease. Here we have cloned a complementary DNA from human placental messenger RNA encoding a precursor protein of 121 amino acids which gives rise to a mature peptide identical to the neuropeptide neurokinin B (NKB) of other mammalian species. In female rats, concentrations of NKB several-fold above that of an animal 20 days into pregnancy caused substantial pressor activity. In human pregnancy, the expression of NKB was confined to the outer syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta, significant concentrations of NKB could be detected in plasma as early as week 9, and plasma concentrations of NKB were grossly elevated in pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. We conclude that elevated levels of NKB in early pregnancy may be an indicator of hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and that treatment with certain neurokinin receptor antagonists may be useful in alleviating the symptoms.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Despite their opposite effects on signal transduction, the nonapeptide hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and its V1a receptor-selective cyclic peptide antagonist d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP display homologous primary structures, differing only at residues 1 and 2. These structural similarities led us to hypothesize that both ligands could interact with the same binding pocket in the V1a receptor. To determine receptor residues responsible for discriminating binding of agonist and antagonist ligands, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of conserved aromatic and hydrophilic residues as well as nonconserved residues, all located in the transmembrane binding pocket of the V1a receptor. Mutation of aromatic residues of transmembrane region VI (W304, F307, F308) reduced affinity for the d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP and markedly decreased affinity for the unrelated strongly hydrophobic V1a-selective nonpeptide antagonist SR 49059. Replacement of these aromatic residues had no effect on AVP binding, but increased AVP-induced coupling efficacy of the receptor for its G protein. Mutating hydrophilic residues Q108, K128 and Q185 in transmembrane regions II, III and IV, respectively, led to a decrease in affinity for both agonists and antagonists. Finally, the nonconserved residues T333 and A334 in transmembrane region VII, controlled the V1a/V2 binding selectivity for both nonpeptide and cyclic peptide antagonists. Thus, because conserved aromatic residues of the V1a receptor binding pocket seem essential for antagonists and do not contribute at all to the binding of agonists, we propose that these residues differentiate agonist vs. antagonist ligand binding.',\n",

While moieties in the immunoglobulin-like domains of L1 have been implicated in both heterophilic and homophilic binding, the function of the fibronectin (FN)-like repeats remains largely unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that the third FN-like repeat of L1 (FN3) spontaneously homomultimerizes to form trimeric and higher order complexes. Remarkably, these complexes support direct RGD-independent interactions with several integrins, including alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(5)beta(1). A pep- tide derived from the putative C-C' loop of FN3 (GSQRKHSKRHIHKDHV(852)) also forms trimeric complexes and supports alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(5)beta(1) binding. Substitution of the dibasic RK(841) and KR(845) sequences within this peptide or the FN3 domain limited multimerization and abrogated integrin binding. Evidence is presented that the multimerization of, and integrin binding to, the FN3 domain is regulated both by conformational constraints imposed by other domains and by plasmin- mediated cleavage within the sequence RK( downward arrow)HSK( downward arrow)RH(846). The integrin alpha(9)beta(1), which also recognizes the FN3 domain, colocalizes with L1 in a manner restricted to sites of cell-cell contact. We propose that distal receptor ligation events at the cell-cell interface may induce a conformational change within the L1 ectodomain that culminates in receptor multimerization and integrin recruitment via interaction with the FN3 domain.\",\n",

A new member of the interferon receptor family, which we term IL-22R, functions as a second component together with CRF2-4 to enable IL-22 signaling. IL-22 does not bind the IL-10R. Cell lines were identified that respond to IL-22 by activation of STATs 1, 3, and 5, but were unresponsive to IL-10.

A putative PDZ-binding motif at the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of JAM was required for mediating the interaction of JAM with ZO-1, as assessed by in vitro binding and coprecipitation experiments.

They are located within the CD loop of the first fibronectin type III (FnIII)-like domain and the EF loop of the second FnIII-like domain. The first binding site was identified by exploiting the different abilities of human IL-5Ralpha (hIL-5Ralpha) and mouse IL-5Ralpha (mIL-5Ralpha) to bind hIL-5. Here we show that ovine IL-5 (oIL-5) has the ability to activate the hIL-5Ralpha but not the mIL-5Ralpha. By using chimeras of the mIL-5Ralpha and hIL-5Ralpha we demonstrate that residues within the first and third FnIII-like domains of mIL-5Ralpha are responsible for this lack of activity. Furthermore, mutation of residues on hIL-5Ralpha to mIL-5Ralpha within the predicted DE and FG loop regions of the third FnIII domain reduces oIL-5 activity. These results show that regions of the third FnIII domain of IL-5Ralpha are involved in binding, in addition to the regions in domains one and two of the IL-5Ralpha that were identified in an earlier study.',\n",

A large epitope 1 for high-affinity BMPR-IA binding was detected spanning the interface of the BMP-2 dimer. A smaller epitope 2 for the low-affinity binding of BMPR-II was found to be assembled by determinants of a single monomer. Symmetry-related pairs of the two juxtaposed epitopes occur near the BMP-2 poles. Mutations in both epitopes yielded variants with reduced biological activity in C2C12 cells; however, only epitope 2 variants behaved as antagonists partially or completely inhibiting BMP-2 activity.

To unequivocally interpret the results of such studies, it is essential that the host cell line does not endogenously express the receptor of interest and in addition is unresponsive to the receptor's natural ligand. Here we describe an approach to overcome such difficulties associated with orphan receptors or, as in the present case, receptors whose endogenous ligand ubiquitously affects mammalian cells. The functional heterologous assay system described is for the hEdg2 receptor, which uses lysophosphatidic acid as its endogenous ligand. Once activated, this receptor mediates its effects via multiple secondary messenger pathways, including a Gi-coupled pathway. We have transiently expressed a pertussis toxin-insensitive hEdg2 receptor-ratGialpha1 fusion protein into human embryonic kidney cells and have monitored the ability of compounds to stimulate [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in membranes prepared from these cells after pretreatment with toxin. Because the assay conditions used favor Gi-mediated responses and because endogenous Gialpha subunits are rendered inactive, the response measured is, by definition, fusion protein-mediated. Consequently, we have developed an assay that monitors definitively Edg2 receptor-mediated responses in a mammalian cell line.

       "  'Abstract': 'TALL-1 is a recently identified member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family that costimulates B lymphocyte proliferation. Here we show that B cell maturation protein (BCMA), a member of the TNF receptor family that is expressed only by B lymphocytes, specifically binds to TALL-1. A soluble receptor containing the extracellular domain of BCMA blocks the binding of TALL-1 to its receptor on the plasma membrane and inhibits TALL-1-triggered B lymphocyte costimulation. Overexpression of BCMA activates NF-kappaB, and this activation is potentiated by TALL-1. Moreover, BCMA-mediated NF-kappaB activation is inhibited by dominant negative mutants of TNF receptor-associated factor 5 (TRAF5), TRAF6, NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), and IkappaB kinase (IKK). These data indicate that BCMA is a receptor for TALL-1 and BCMA activates NF-kappaB through a TRAF5-, TRAF6-, NIK-, and IKK-dependent pathway. The identification of BCMA as a NF-kappaB-activating receptor for TALL-1 suggests molecular targets for drug development against certain immunodeficient or autoimmune diseases.',\n",

LEC induced maximal migration of CCR1 and CCR8 transfected cells at 89.3 nmol/L and cell adhesion at 5.6 nmol/L.

All 3 chemokines induced maximal static adhesion at 5 to 7 nmol/L. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody to LEC was developed to demonstrate that the unusually high concentration of LEC required to induce chemotaxis was a property of LEC and not as a result of an irrelevant protein contamination.

       "  'Abstract': 'Activin A is a pluripotent growth factor with important roles in development, erythropoiesis and the local regulation of many tissues. At the post-translational level, the amount of activin A produced by cells may be modulated through the diversion of activin A subunits into the formation of inhibin or other activins containing heterodimeric forms. Once assembled, activin interacts with various low- and high-affinity binding proteins, such as follistatin and alpha(2)-macroglobulin, that have consequences for receptor availability. In common with other TGFbeta family members, activin signals through pairs of type I and II receptor kinases and the Smad intracellular signalling cascade. Other checkpoints have been identified such as the recently identified pseudoreceptor, BAMBI. These emerging findings point to a tightly coordinated regulation of the exposure of a cell or tissue to activin, consistent with the low amounts of this potent factor that are necessary to modulate cellular responses.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have previously reported that the human transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) gene encodes three forms of TGF-alpha precursors, designated wild type (WT), variant I (VaI), and variant II (VaII), derived from alternative splicing. The two carboxyl-terminal valine residues of WT are replaced by 5 (GCRLY) or 4 (ATLG) amino acids in VaI or VaII, respectively. When overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, VaI and ValI, but not WT, support autonomous growth. We detected tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 in the absence of serum, in CHO cells expressing WT, VaI, or VaII, but not in mock transfectants. These observations prompted us to investigate possible interactions between the ErbBs and the TGF-alpha precursors in CHO cells. All TGF-alpha precursors were found to co-immunoprecipitate with the ErbBs, but with different specificity. WT co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB4, but not with ErbB1, ErbB2, or ErbB3. VaI and VaII co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB2, but not with ErbB1, ErbB3, or ErbB4. Confocal fluorescent microscopy analysis demonstrated that WT, VaI, and VaII all distribute equally to the cell surface while, as expected, a WT mutant lacking the two C-terminal valine residues does not. Point and deletion mutants involving the unique carboxyl-terminal residues of WT, VaI and VaII, indicated that the interactions between the three TGF-alpha precursors and the ErbBs were mediated by their carboxyl-terminal regions, which constitute distinct protein-binding motifs. A chimera of the intracellular domain of WT TGF-alpha linked to exogenous transmembrane and extracellular domains retained both the cell surface distribution and the specific interaction with ErbB4 of full-length WT, confirming that this interaction is mediated by the C-terminus of the TGF-alpha precursor. While interactions of WT and variant TGF-alpha with the ErbBs all result in ErbB2 activation, they produce different biological consequences, suggesting that the various TGF-alpha precursors differentially modulate ErbB signaling.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The neurotensin (NT) receptor, subtype 1 (NTR1), is a 7-transmembrane-spanning receptor, forming 3 extracellular and 3 intracellular loops. Previously, we showed that the third outer loop (E3) is the binding site for NT and its analogs, several of which bind with higher affinity to rat NTR1 (rNTR1) than to human NTR1 (hNTR1). In particular, NT34 [3,1'-naphthyl-l-Ala(11)]NT(8-13) has greater than 60-fold higher affinity for rNTR1 (46 and 60 pM for transiently- and stably-transfected cells, respectively) than for hNTR1 (2.8 and 5.8 nM for transiently- and stably-transfected cells, respectively) isolated from transfected cell membranes. Previously, our molecular modeling studies of rNTR1 and hNTR1 showed that the binding pocket in the human receptor for NT34 is smaller in volume from the bulky residue Tyr(339) in the pocket center, as compared with the corresponding residue Phe(344) in the rat binding pocket. Therefore, with site-directed mutagenesis, we derived mutant forms of rNTR1(F344Y) and hNTR1(Y339F). Examination of the mutant receptors from membranal preparations of transfected cells in radioligand binding assays and with intact cells in functional assays (phosphatidyl-4,5-bisphosphate turnover) showed that the human-like rat receptor and the rat-like human receptor bound NT34 with a predicted reverse of binding compared with its binding to the wild-type receptors. These results strongly affirm our molecular modeling studies and demonstrate the importance of the study of even minor structural variations in proteins to determine the basis of significantly different drug responses, an area of focus for pharmacological research in the 21st century.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The semaphorin family of proteins constitute one of the major cues for axonal guidance. The prototypic member of this family is Sema3A, previously designated semD/III or collapsin-1. Sema3A acts as a diffusible, repulsive guidance cue in vivo for the peripheral projections of embryonic dorsal root ganglion neurons. Sema3A binds with high affinity to neuropilin-1 on growth cone filopodial tips. Although neuropilin-1 is required for Sema3A action, it is incapable of transmitting a Sema3A signal to the growth cone interior. Instead, the Sema3A/neuropilin-1 complex interacts with another transmembrane protein, plexin, on the surface of growth cones. Certain semaphorins, other than Sema3A, can bind directly to plexins. The intracellular domain of plexin is responsible for initiating the signal transduction cascade leading to growth cone collapse, axon repulsion, or growth cone turning. This intracellular cascade involves the monomeric G-protein, Rac1, and a family of neuronal proteins, the CRMPs. Rac1 is likely to be involved in semaphorin-induced rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, but how plexin controls Rac1 activity is not known. Vertebrate CRMPs are homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-33 protein, which is required for proper axon morphology in worms. CRMPs are essential for Sema3A-induced, neuropilin-plexin-mediated growth cone collapse, but the molecular interactions of growth cone CRMPs are not well defined. Mechanistic aspects of plexin-based signaling for semaphorin guidance cues may have implications for other axon guidance events and for the basis of growth cone motility.',\n",

Drosophila and mammalian Fringe proteins possess a fucose-specific beta1,3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity that initiates elongation of O-linked fucose residues attached to epidermal growth factor-like sequence repeats of Notch. We obtained biological evidence that Fringe-dependent elongation of O-linked fucose on Notch modulates Notch signalling by using co-culture assays in mammalian cells and by expression of an enzymatically inactive Fringe mutant in Drosophila. The post-translational modification of Notch by Fringe represents a striking example of modulation of a signalling event by differential receptor glycosylation and identifies a mechanism that is likely to be relevant to other signalling pathways.',\n",

We show that Reelin inhibits migration of cortical neurons and enables detachment of neurons from radial glia. Recombinant and native Reelin associate with alpha3beta1 integrin, which regulates neuron-glia interactions and is required to achieve proper laminar organization. The effect of Reelin on cortical neuronal migration in vitro and in vivo depends on interactions between Reelin and alpha3beta1 integrin. Absence of alpha3beta1 leads to a reduction of Dab1, a signaling protein acting downstream of Reelin. Thus, Reelin may arrest neuronal migration and promote normal cortical lamination by binding alpha3beta1 integrin and modulating integrin-mediated cellular adhesion.',\n",

Comparison of the primary sequence of ASP with the known MSH pharmacophore provides no suggestion about the putative bioactive domain(s) of ASP. To identify such bioactive motif(s), we synthesized 15-mer peptides that spanned the primary sequence of ASP and determined their effects on the melanogenic activities of murine melanocytes. Northern and Western blotting were used, together with chemical analysis of melanins and enzymatic assays, to identify three distinct bioactive regions of ASP that down-regulate eumelanogenesis. The decrease in eumelanin production was mediated by down-regulation of mRNA levels for tyrosinase and other melanogenic enzymes, as occurs in vivo, and these effects were comparable to those elicited by intact recombinant ASP. Shorter peptides in those motifs were synthesized and their effects on melanogenesis were further investigated. The amino acid arginine, which is present in the MSH peptide pharmacophore (HFRW), is also in the most active domain of ASP (KVARP). Our data suggest that lysines and an arginine (in motifs such as KxxxxKxxR or KxxRxxxxK) are important for the bioactivity of ASP.

       "  'Abstract': 'The leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor and triggers a signaling pathway that leads to growth suppression. We find that decorin causes a functional inactivation of the oncogenic ErbB2 protein in breast carcinoma cells. Upon de novo expression of decorin, the ErbB2 protein is reduced by approximately 40%, whereas its degree of tyrosyl phosphorylation is almost completely abrogated. Both co-culture experiments or experiments with recombinant decorin demonstrate an initial induction of ErbB2 tyrosine kinase, followed by a profound and long-lasting down-regulation of its activity. This leads to growth inhibition and cytodifferentiation of mammary tumor cells and a concurrent suppression of their tumorigenic potential in vivo. These decorin-mediated effects appear to involve the activation of ErbB4, which in turn would block the phosphorylation of heterodimers containing either ErbB2 or ErbB3. These results provide an explanation for the heightened decorin levels around invasive carcinomas and suggest that decorin may function as a natural antagonist of neoplastic cells enriched in ErbB2.',\n",

We also show that interaction between ADAM-12 or -15 and alpha(9)beta(1) supports cell-cell interaction. Interestingly, the cation requirement and integrin activation status required for alpha(9)beta(1)/ADAM-mediated cell adhesion and cell-cell interaction is similar to those required for known integrin-extracellular matrix interaction. These results are quite different from recent reports that ADAM-2/alpha(6)beta(1) interaction during sperm/egg fusion requires an integrin activation status distinct from that for extracellular matrix interaction. These results suggest that alpha(9)beta(1) may be a major receptor for ADAMs that lack RGD motifs, and that, considering a wide distribution of ADAMs and alpha(9)beta(1), this interaction may be of potential biological and pathological significance.',\n",

These cytokines drive the assembly of multisubunit receptor complexes, all of which contain at least one molecule of the transmembrane signaling receptor gp130. IL-11 has been shown to induce gp130-dependent signaling through the formation of a high affinity complex with the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) and gp130. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified three distinct receptor binding sites of IL-11, which enable it to form this high affinity receptor complex. Here we present data from immunoprecipitation experiments, using differentially tagged forms of ligand and soluble receptor components, which show that multiple copies of IL-11, IL-11R, and gp130 are present in the receptor complex. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that sites II and III of IL-11 are independent gp130 binding epitopes and that both are essential for gp130 dimerization. We also show that a stable high affinity complex of IL-11, IL-11R, and gp130 can be resolved by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its composition verified by second dimension denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results indicate that the three receptor binding sites of IL-11 and the Ig-like domain of gp130 are all essential for this stable receptor complex to be formed. We therefore propose that IL-11 forms a hexameric receptor complex composed of two molecules each of IL-11, IL-11R, and gp130.',\n",

Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the beta4-beta5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency. The reciprocal loop replacement mutant (FGF2-L4/7) retained FGF-2 like affinity for FGFR1 and for KGFR. Our results show that topologically similar regions in these two FGFs have different roles in regulating receptor binding specificity and suggest that specificity may require the concerted action of distinct regions of an FGF.',\n",

A cross-blocking study indicated that L- and P-selectin recognize close or overlapping sites on versican, whereas CD44 recognizes separate sites. We also show that soluble L- and P-selectin directly bind to immobilized CS B, CS E, and HS and that soluble CD44 directly binds to immobilized hyaluronic acid, CH, and all the CS chains examined. Consistent with these results, structural analysis showed that versican is modified with at least CS B and CS C.

Meanwhile, ligand-induced cleavage and nuclear translocation of the Notch protein are considered to be fundamental for Notch signaling, yet direct observation of the behavior of the Notch molecule after ligand binding, including cleavage and nuclear translocation, has been lacking. In this report, we investigated these issues for Notch2. All of the three DSL proteins bound to endogenous Notch2 on the surface of BaF3 cells, although characteristics of Jagged2 for binding to Notch2 apparently differed from that of Delta1 and Jagged1. After binding, the three DSL proteins induced cleavage of the membrane-spanning subunit of Notch2 (Notch2(TM)), which occurred within 15 min. In a simultaneous time course, the cleaved fragment of Notch2(TM) was translocated into the nucleus. Interestingly, the cleaved Notch2 fragment was hyperphosphorylated also in a time-dependent manner. Finally, binding of DSL proteins to Notch2 also activated the transcription of reporter genes driven by the RBP-Jkappa-responsive promoter. Together, these data indicate that all of these DSL proteins function as ligands for Notch2. Moreover, the findings of rapid cleavage, nuclear translocation, and phosphorylation of Notch2 after ligand binding facilitate the understanding of the Notch signaling.',\n",

They belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and share 64% homology at the protein level. Functional evidence demonstrating the identity of the recombinant protein with GPVI was shown by binding to its natural ligand collagen; binding to convulxin (Cvx), a GPVI-specific ligand from snake venom; binding of anti-GPVI IgG isolated from a patient; and association to the FcR-gamma chain. The study also demonstrated that the soluble protein blocks Cvx and collagen-induced platelet aggregation and that GPVI expression is restricted to megakaryocytes and platelets. Finally, human GPVI was mapped to chromosome 19, long arm, region 1, band 3 (19q13), in the same region as multiple members of the Ig superfamily. This work offers the opportunity to explore the involvement of GPVI in thrombotic disease, to develop alternative antithrombotic compounds, and to characterize the mechanism involved in GPVI genetic deficiencies.

       "  'Abstract': 'Matriptase is an epithelial-derived, integral membrane serine protease. The enzyme was initially isolated from human breast cancer cells and has been implicated in breast cancer invasion and metastasis. In the current study, using active matriptase isolated from human milk, we demonstrate that matriptase is able to cleave various synthetic substrates with arginine or lysine as their P1 sites and prefers small side chain amino acids, such as Ala and Gly, at P2 sites. For the most reactive substrates, N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (N-t-Boc)-gamma-benzyl-Glu-Ala-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) and N-t-Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC, the K(m) values were determined to be 3. 81 and 4.89 microm, respectively. We further demonstrated that matriptase can convert hepatocyte growth factor/scattering factor to its active form, which can induce scatter of Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells and can activate c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation in A549 human lung carcinoma cells. In addition, we noted that matriptase can activate urokinase plasminogen activator but has no affect on plasminogen. These results suggest that matriptase could act as an epithelial, upstream membrane activator to recruit and activate stromal-derived downstream effectors important for extracellular matrix degradation and epithelial migration, two major events of tissue remodeling, cancer invasion, and metastasis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Subtypes of the calcium-independent receptors for alpha-latrotoxin (CIRL1-3) define a distinct subgroup within the large family of the seven-transmembrane region cell surface receptors. The physiological function of CIRLs is unknown because neither extracellular ligands nor intracellular coupling proteins (G-proteins) have been identified. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a novel interaction between the C termini of CIRL1 and -2 and the PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain of a recently discovered multidomain protein family (ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank) present in human and rat brain. In vitro, CIRL1 and CIRL2 interacted strongly with the PDZ domain of ProSAP1. The specificity of this interaction has been verified by in vivo experiments using solubilized rat brain membrane fractions and ProSAP1 antibodies; only CIRL1, but not CIRL2, was co-immunoprecipitated with ProSAP1. In situ hybridization revealed that ProSAP1 and CIRL1 are co-expressed in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Colocalization was also observed at the subcellular level, as both CIRL1 and ProSAP1 are enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction from rat brain. Expression of all three CIRL isoforms is highly regulated during postnatal brain development, with CIRL3 exhibiting its highest expression levels immediately after birth, followed by CIRL2 and finally CIRL1 in aged rats.',\n",

Its receptor complex consists of a non-signaling alpha chain, CNTFR, and two signaling beta chains, gp130 and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Striking phenotypic differences between CNTF- and CNTFR-deficient mice suggest that CNTFR serves as a receptor for a second, developmentally important ligand. We have identified this factor as a stable secreted complex of cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) and the soluble receptor cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF). CLF expression was required for CLC secretion, and the complex acted only on cells expressing functional CNTF receptors. The CLF/CLC complex activated gp130, LIFR and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and supported motor neuron survival. Our results indicate that the CLF/CLC complex is a second ligand for CNTFR with potentially important implications in nervous system development.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'E-cadherins are well characterized cell surface molecules expressed in epithelial cells, which play a major role in cell adhesion through the establishment of calcium-dependent homophilic interactions at sites of cell-cell contacts. They are also integral components of morphogenetic programs controlling the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of epithelia. Accumulated evidence indicates that the E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion system is highly regulated from inside the cells by a number of intracellular signaling pathways. Recently available information suggests that E-cadherins may also play a role in the transduction of signals from the outside of the cell to the cytoplasm. However, the nature of the biochemical routes regulated by E-cadherins is still largely unknown. In this study, we set out to explore the possibility that E-cadherins may regulate the activity of MAPK, a key signaling pathway involved in cell fate decisions, upon the formation of cell-cell contacts among neighboring cells. By using an immortalized non-tumorigenic keratinocyte cell line, HaCat, as a model system, we provide evidence that the assembly of calcium-dependent adherens junctions leads to a rapid and remarkable increase in the state of activation of MAPK and that this event is mediated by E-cadherins. Furthermore, we found that E-cadherins stimulate the MAPK pathway through the ligand-independent activation of epidermal growth factor receptors and the consequent activation of a biochemical route leading to the stimulation of MAPKs. These findings suggest that E-cadherins can initiate outside-in signal transducing pathways through the engagement of tyrosine kinase receptors for epidermal growth factor, thus providing a novel molecular mechanism whereby these cell adhesion molecules may ultimately control the fate of normal and transformed epithelial cells.',\n",

Although MEC is poorly expressed in skin, its closest homologue is the keratinocyte-expressed cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK; CCL27), and MEC supports chemotaxis of transfected lymphoid cells expressing CCR10, a known CTACK receptor. In contrast to CTACK, however, MEC also supports migration through CCR3. Consistent with this, MEC attracts eosinophils in addition to memory lymphocyte subsets.

       "  'Abstract': 'Protease-activated receptors (PARs) mediate cell activation after proteolytic cleavage of their extracellular amino terminus. Thrombin selectively cleaves PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 to induce activation of platelets and vascular cells, while PAR2 is preferentially cleaved by trypsin. In pathological situations, other proteolytic enzymes may be generated in the circulation and could modify the responses of PARs by cleaving their extracellular domains. To assess the ability of such proteases to activate or inactivate PARs, we designed a strategy for locating cleavage sites on the exofacial NH(2)-terminal fragments of the receptors. The first extracellular segments of PAR1 (PAR1E) and PAR2 (PAR2E) expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli were incubated with a series of proteases likely to be encountered in the circulation during thrombosis or inflammation. Kinetic and dose-response studies were performed, and the cleavage products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Thrombin cleaved PAR1E at the Arg41-Ser42 activation site at concentrations known to induce cellular activation, supporting a native conformation of the recombinant polypeptide. Plasmin, calpain and leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3 cleaved at multiple sites and would be expected to disable PAR1 by cleaving COOH-terminal to the activation site. Cleavage specificities were further confirmed using activation site defective PAR1E S42P mutant polypeptides. Surface plasmon resonance studies on immobilized PAR1E or PAR1E S42P were consistent with cleavage results obtained in solution and allowed us to determine affinities of PAR1E-thrombin binding. FACS analyses of intact platelets confirmed the cleavage of PAR1 downstream of the Arg41-Ser42 site. Mass spectrometry studies of PAR2E predicted activation of PAR2 by trypsin through cleavage at the Arg36-Ser37 site, no effect of thrombin, and inactivation of the receptor by plasmin, calpain and leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3. The inhibitory effect of elastase was confirmed on native PAR1 and PAR2 on the basis of Ca(2+) signaling studies in endothelial cells. It was concluded that none of the main proteases generated during fibrinolysis or inflammation appears to be able to signal through PAR1 or PAR2. This strategy provides results which can be extended to the native receptor to predict its activation or inactivation, and it could likewise be used to study other PARs or protease-dependent processes.',\n",

Here we use three distinct vertebrate frizzled receptors (Xfz3, Xfz4 and Xfz7) and describe whether and how their C-terminal cytoplasmic regions transduce the Wnt/beta-catenin signal. We show that Xfz3 activates this pathway in the absence of exogenous ligands, while Xfz4 and Xfz7 interact with Xwnt5A to activate this pathway. Analysis using chimeric receptors reveals that their C-terminal cytoplasmic regions are functionally equivalent in Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Furthermore, a conserved motif (Lys-Thr-X-X-X-Trp) located two amino acids after the seventh transmembrane domain is required for activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and for membrane relocalization and phosphorylation of Dishevelled. Frizzled receptors with point mutations affecting either of the three conserved residues are defective in Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. These findings provide functional evidence supporting a role of this conserved motif in the modulation of Wnt signalling.

Missense mutations in a conserved hydrophilic domain of nicastrin increase A beta42 and A beta40 peptide secretion. Deletions in this domain inhibit A beta production.

The receptor for IL-13 is comprised of the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Ralpha) subunit and a low-affinity IL-13-binding subunit, IL-13Ralpha1. An additional receptor, IL-13Ralpha2, binds to IL-13 with high affinity, but lacks the cytoplasmic domain for signaling. In this study, we isolated the mouse IL-13Ralpha1 gene (Il13ra1) of approximately 56 kb that spans the entire coding region. The mouse Il13ra1 gene is composed of 11 exons, and shows striking similarity in genomic structure to the previously reported class I cytokine receptor genes. Motifs characteristic of the cytokine receptor family are similarly organized on the genome, including conserved cysteines, a WSxWS motif, and Box1, indicating closely related genetic evolution of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Alternative mRNA splicings were demonstrated to generate variant transcripts that encode soluble IL-13Ralpha1. The mouse Ill13ra1 gene was mapped to the proximal region of the mouse X chromosome, and was closely linked to the DXPas3 locus by interspecific backcross analysis. Il13ra1 mRNA was co-expressed with I14ra mRNA in mouse myeloid and natural killer cells on which IL-13 has been known to act, whereas the Il13ra2 mRNA was not detected in these cells, indicating that IL-13Ralpha1 is the major component of the IL-13 receptor complex in lymphohematopoietic cells.',\n",

In this study, expression of MMP upon alpha(4)beta(1)-mediated adhesion of leukocytes to two major ligands, the IIICS-1 domain of fibronectin and VCAM-1, has been examined. Adhesion of T lymphoblastoid Jurkat cells to the CS-1 peptide induced expression of mRNA for two MMPs, gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9). As evaluated by relative RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses, the level of mRNA was upregulated about 4- to 5-fold for both MMPs compared to control cells maintained in suspension. With time, both enzymes were detected in conditioned media and inside the cells, and their identities were verified by Western blotting and gelatin zymography. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the second major alpha(4)beta(1) ligand, VCAM-1, upregulated mRNA for MMP-2 (3.5-fold) and failed to induce expression of mRNA for MMP-9. Accordingly, only MMP-2 protein was detected in conditioned media of cells adherent to VCAM-1. Occupancy of alpha(4)beta(1) on the surface of suspended cells with soluble CS-1 peptide or VCAM-1 did not upregulate synthesis and release of MMPs. A similar pattern of induction of MMPs after adhesion to CS-1 and VCAM-1 was observed in T lymphocytes isolated from human blood. These results demonstrate that adhesion of T lymphocytes through alpha(4)beta(1) to different ligands, which bind to similar or overlapping sites in the integrin, induces intracellular events leading to distinct patterns of MMPs biosynthesis.',\n",

However, cortistatin also has many properties distinct from somatostatin including induction of slow-wave sleep, apparently by antagonism of the excitatory effects of acetylcholine on the cortex, reduction of locomotor activity, and activation of cation selective currents not responsive to somatostatin. Expression of mRNA encoding cortistatin follows a circadian rhythm and is upregulated on deprivation of sleep, suggesting cortistatin is a sleep modulatory factor.

Receptor density was less in human coronary artery smooth muscle (14.6+/-3 amol mm(-2), n=10) than rat aorta with no significant difference between normal and atherosclerotic vessels. In human skeletal muscle [(125)I]-U-II bound to a single receptor population with K(D)=0.24+/-0.17 nM and B(max)=1.97+/-1.1 fmol mg(-1) protein (n=4). U-II contracted human coronary, mammary and radial arteries, saphenous and umbilical veins with sub-nanomolar EC(50) values. U-II was 50 times more potent in arteries and <10 times more potent in veins than endothelin-1 (ET-1). The maximum response to U-II ( approximately 20% of control KCl) was significantly less than to ET-1 ( approximately 80% KCl). In contrast, in rat aorta, U-II and ET-1 were equipotent with similar maximum responses. This is the first report of high affinity receptors for [(125)I]-U-II in human CNS and peripheral tissues. This peptide produces potent, low efficacy, vasoconstriction in human arteries and veins. These data suggest a potential role for U-II in human physiology.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have previously shown that antimicrobial peptides like defensins have the capacity to mobilize leukocytes in host defense. LL-37 is the cleaved antimicrobial 37-residue, COOH-terminal peptide of hCAP18 (human cationic antimicrobial protein with a molecular size of 18 kD), the only identified member in humans of a family of proteins called cathelicidins. LL-37/hCAP18 is produced by neutrophils and various epithelial cells. Here we report that LL-37 is chemotactic for, and can induce Ca(2+) mobilization in, human monocytes and formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1)-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. LL-37-induced Ca(2+) mobilization in monocytes can also be cross-desensitized by an FPRL1-specific agonist. Furthermore, LL-37 is also chemotactic for human neutrophils and T lymphocytes that are known to express FPRL1. Our results suggest that, in addition to its microbicidal activity, LL-37 may contribute to innate and adaptive immunity by recruiting neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells to sites of microbial invasion by interacting with FPRL1.',\n",

Some of the proteoglycans have distinct core protein structures, and others display similarities and thus may be grouped into families such as the syndecans, the glypicans, or the hyalectans (or lecticans). Proteoglycans can be found in almost all tissues being present in the extracellular matrix, on cellular surfaces, or in intracellular granules. In recent years, brain proteoglycans have attracted growing interest due to their highly regulated spatiotemporal expression during nervous system development and maturation. There is increasing evidence that different proteoglycans act as regulators of cell migration, axonal pathfinding, synaptogenesis, and structural plasticity. This review summarizes the most recent data on structures and functions of brain proteoglycans and focuses on new physiological concepts for their potential roles in the developing central nervous system.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Group X secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-X) has recently been shown to possess a powerful potency for releasing arachidonic acid from cell membrane phospholipids. Here, we report the purification of mouse pro- and mature forms of sPLA2-X, as well as its expression and biological functions. Purified pro-sPLA2-X was found to possess a propeptide of 11 amino acid residues attached at the NH2-terminals of the mature protein, and showed as little as 8% of the PLA2 activity of the mature form. Limited proteolysis of pro-sPLA2-X with trypsin resulted in the appearance of the mature form with a concomitant increase in PLA2 activity, suggesting a requirement of proteolytic removal of the propeptide for the optimal activity. The expression of sPLA2-X mRNA was detected in various tissues including the lung, thymus, and spleen, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed its expression in splenic macrophages. In the spleen cells, mature sPLA2-X elicited a prompt release of arachidonic acid with significant production of prostaglandin E2 more efficiently than group IB and IIA sPLA2s. In addition, sPLA2-X was identified as a high-affinity ligand for both native and recombinant form of mouse PLA2 receptor (PLA2R). However, there was no significant difference in the sPLA2-X-induced arachidonic acid release responses in the spleen cells between wild-type and PLA2R-deficient mice. These findings strongly suggest that sPLA2-X possesses two distinct biological functions in mice: it elicits a marked release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids leading to the production of lipid mediators based on its enzymatic potency, and it acts as a natural ligand for the PLA2R that has been shown to play a critical role in the production of inflammatory cytokines during endotoxic shock.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The central nervous system octapeptide, neuropeptide FF (NPFF), is believed to play a role in pain modulation and opiate tolerance. Two G protein-coupled receptors, NPFF1 and NPFF2, were isolated from human and rat central nervous system tissues. NPFF specifically bound to NPFF1 (K(d) = 1.13 nm) and NPFF2 (K(d) = 0.37 nm), and both receptors were activated by NPFF in a variety of heterologous expression systems. The localization of mRNA and binding sites of these receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the lateral hypothalamus, the spinal trigeminal nuclei, and the thalamic nuclei supports a role for NPFF in pain modulation. Among the receptors with the highest amino acid sequence homology to NPFF1 and NPFF2 are members of the orexin, NPY, and cholecystokinin families, which have been implicated in feeding. These similarities together with the finding that BIBP3226, an anorexigenic Y1 receptor ligand, also binds to NPFF1 suggest a potential role for NPFF1 in feeding. The identification of NPFF1 and NPFF2 will help delineate their roles in these and other physiological functions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex is a platelet surface receptor that binds thrombin as one of its ligands, although the biological significance of thrombin interaction remains unclear. In this study we have used several approaches to investigate the GPIb alpha-thrombin interaction in more detail and to study its effect on the thrombin-induced elaboration of fibrin. We found that both glycocalicin and the amino-terminal fragment of GPIb alpha reduced the release of fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen by about 50% by a noncompetitive allosteric mechanism. Similarly, GPIb alpha caused in thrombin an allosteric reduction in the rate of turnover of the small peptide substrate d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA. The K(d) for the glycocalicin-thrombin interaction was 1 microm at physiological ionic strength but was highly salt-dependent, decreasing to 0.19 microm at 100 mm NaCl (Gamma(salt) = -4.2). The salt dependence was characteristic of other thrombin ligands that bind to exosite II of this enzyme, and we confirmed this as the GPIb alpha-binding site on thrombin by using thrombin mutants and by competition binding studies. R68E or R70E mutations in exosite I of thrombin had little effect on its interaction with GPIb alpha. Both the allosteric inhibition of fibrinogen turnover caused by GPIb alpha binding to these mutants, and the K(d) values for their interactions with GPIb alpha were similar to those of wild-type thrombin. In contrast, R89E and K248E mutations in exosite II of thrombin markedly increased the K(d) values for the interactions of these thrombin mutants with GPIb alpha by 10- and 25-fold, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that low molecular weight heparin (which binds to thrombin exosite II) but not hirugen (residues 54-65 of hirudin, which binds to exosite I of thrombin) inhibited thrombin binding to GPIb alpha. These data demonstrate that GPIb alpha binds to thrombin exosite II and in so doing causes a conformational change in the active site of thrombin by an allosteric mechanism that alters the accessibility of both its natural substrate, fibrinogen, and the small peptidyl substrate d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA.',\n",

Nectin/PRR members are adhesion molecules expressed at intercellular junctions. Nectin3/PRR3 is a transmembrane protein, whose extracellular region contains three Ig-like domains (V, C and C) and shares approximately 30% identity with the other members. It is mainly expressed in testis and placental tissues. SDS-PAGE analyses demonstrate that nectin3/PRR3 has a molecular weight of 83kDa. Nectin1/PRR1L and nectin2/PRR2S and L were found to be specifically expressed at the intercellular junctions. This localization is in part due to the interaction of the C-terminal part of these receptors (ended by the consensus sequence A/EXYV) and the PDZ domain of afadin. In this report we demonstrate that the nectin3/PRR3 receptor carries the A/EXYV consensus sequence and interacts in vivo with both long and short isoforms of afadin. These results suggest that the human nectin3/PRR3 is a new afadin-associated molecule.',\n",

We further investigated this domain by mutating 12 amino acid residues which could participate in the formation of a tight bend (W67) or a coiled coil motif. They were changed to alanine (A) and the cDNAs were transiently transfected into Cos cells. All mutants but W67A exhibited K(d) values similar to that of the wild-type receptor. For the W67A mutant, no specific (125)I-VIP binding could be observed. Mutants at the W67 site were further characterized after stable transfection of epitope-tagged VPAC(1) receptor-GFP fusion proteins into CHO cells. W67A, W67E, W67H, and W67K mutants neither bound VIP nor mediated adenylyl cyclase activation by VIP. The W67F mutant mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase only at high VIP concentrations. Microscopic analysis and antibody binding experiments showed that all mutants were similarly expressed at the cell surface of CHO cells. Therefore tryptophan 67 in the human VPAC(1) receptor plays a crucial role in VIP binding due, in part, to its aromatic moiety.',\n",

W., and Koeffler, H. P. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 16618-16625). TfR2 has a pattern of expression and regulation that is distinct from TfR, and mutations in TfR2 have been recognized as the cause of a non-HFE linked form of hemochromatosis (Camaschella, C., Roetto, A., Cali, A., De Gobbi, M., Garozzo, G., Carella, M., Majorano, N., Totaro, A., and Gasparini, P. (2000) Nat. Genet. 25, 14-15). To investigate the relationship between TfR, TfR2, Tf, and HFE, we performed a series of binding experiments using soluble forms of these proteins. We find no detectable binding between TfR2 and HFE by co-immunoprecipitation or using a surface plasmon resonance-based assay. The affinity of TfR2 for iron-loaded Tf was determined to be 27 nm, 25-fold lower than the affinity of TfR for Tf. These results imply that HFE regulates Tf-mediated iron uptake only from the classical TfR and that TfR2 does not compete for HFE binding in cells expressing both forms of TfR.',\n",

Heparin also interacts with FGFR in the adjoining 1:1 FGF:FGFR complex to promote FGFR dimerization. The 6-O-sulfate group of heparin plays a pivotal role in mediating both interactions. The unexpected stoichiometry of heparin binding in the structure led us to propose a revised model for FGFR dimerization. Biochemical data in support of this model are also presented.

Human prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) has been identified as an endogenous ligand for GPR10, and occurs as 31 and 20 amino acid forms. The present study characterizes the binding of [(125)I]-PrRP-20 to HEK293 cells stably expressing GPR10 receptors. Specific binding of [(125)I]-PrRP-20 was saturable, and analysis suggested evidence of both high and low affinity sites, with K:(D:) values of 0.026+/-0.006 and 0.57+/-0.14 nM respectively, and B(max) values of 3010+/-400 and 8570+/-2240 fmol mg protein(-1) respectively. Kinetic studies were unable to distinguish two sites, but single site analysis of association and dissociation data produced a K:(D:) of 0.012 nM. Competition studies revealed that human and rat PrRP-20 and PrRP-31 all display high affinity for GPR10. A range of other drugs which are known ligands at receptors which share limited homology with GPR10 were also tested. None of the drugs tested, including the RF-amide neuropeptide FF, demonstrated any affinity for GPR10. Human PrRP-20 failed to alter basal or forskolin-stimulated levels of intracellular cyclic AMP in HEK293-GPR10 cells, suggesting that GPR10 does not couple via either G(s) or G(i). Functional studies using measurements of intracellular calcium confirmed that human and rat PrRP-20 and PrRP-31 are all potent, full agonists at the GPR10 receptor. The response was blocked both by thapsigargin, indicating mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) stores. These studies indicate that [(125)I]-PrRP-20 is a specific, high affinity radioligand for GPR10. The availability of this radioligand binding assay will be a valuable tool for the investigation of the key features involved in PrRP binding and studies on the localization and function of GPR10.',\n",

In an attempt to define the aFGF recognition site on fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), we developed a screening strategy for identifying FGF ligands that bind to the receptor-binding region of FGF. To retain the natural conformation of aFGF during screening, we used biotinylated heparin to immobilize aFGF on a streptavidin-coated dish. A 15-mer phage display peptide library was then screened in the dish and a group of related peptide sequences was identified. These peptide sequences contain two conserved motifs, SSG and VPS, corresponding to two protein sequences of the immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain II of FGFR1 at amino acids 180-182 and 221-223 (CPSSG-VPSDKGNYTC). Further experiments demonstrate that the phage displaying these sequences can specifically bind to aFGF and that the synthesized peptide corresponding in sequence can inhibit mitogenic activity of aFGF. These sequences may thus constitute part of the aFGF-binding region on FGFR1, and the synthesized peptide has the potential to become a therapeutic agent as an aFGF antagonist.',\n",

In this report, we describe the analysis of pharmacological properties of the human calcitonin receptor (hCTR) coexpressed with different RAMPs with the use of the Xenopus laevis melanophore expression system. We show that coexpression of RAMP3 with human calcitonin receptor changed the relative potency of hCTR to human calcitonin (hCAL) and rat amylin. RAMP1 and RAMP2, in contrast, had little effect on the change of hCTR potency to hCAL or rat amylin. When coexpressed with RAMP3, hCTR reversed the relative potency by a 3.5-fold loss in sensitivity to hCAL and a 19-fold increase in sensitivity to rat amylin. AC66, an inverse agonist, produced apparent simple competitive antagonism of hCAL and rat amylin, as indicated by linear Schild regressions. The potency of AC66 was changed in the blockade of rat amylin but not hCAL responses with RAMP3 coexpression. The mean pK(B) for AC66 to hCAL was 9.4 +/- 0.3 without RAMP3 and 9.45 +/- 0.07 with RAMP3. For the antagonism of AC66 to rat amylin, the pK(B) was 9.25 +/- 0.15 without RAMP3 and 8.2 +/- 0.35 with RAMP3. The finding suggests that RAMP3 might modify the active states of calcitonin receptor in such a way as to create a new receptor phenotype that is \"amylin-like.\" Irrespective of the physiological association of the new receptor species, the finding that a coexpressed membrane protein can completely change agonist and antagonist affinities for a receptor raises implications for screening in recombinant receptor systems.',\n",

We report here the identification of a functional IL-TIF receptor complex that consists of two receptor chains, the orphan CRF2-9 and IL-10R2, the second chain of the IL-10 receptor complex. Expression of the CRF2-9 chain in monkey COS cells renders them sensitive to IL-TIF. However, in hamster cells both chains, CRF2-9 and IL-10R2, must be expressed to assemble the functional IL-TIF receptor complex. The CRF2-9 chain (or the IL-TIF-R1 chain) is responsible for Stat recruitment. Substitution of the CRF2-9 intracellular domain with the IFN-gammaR1 intracellular domain changes the pattern of IL-TIF-induced Stat activation. The CRF2-9 gene is expressed in normal liver and kidney, suggesting a possible role for IL-TIF in regulating gene expression in these tissues. Each chain, CRF2-9 and IL-10R2, is capable of binding IL-TIF independently and can be cross-linked to the radiolabeled IL-TIF. However, binding of IL-TIF to the receptor complex is greater than binding to either receptor chain alone. Sharing of the common IL-10R2 chain between the IL-10 and IL-TIF receptor complexes is the first such case for receptor complexes with chains belonging to the class II cytokine receptor family, establishing a novel paradigm for IL-10-related ligands similar to the shared use of the gamma common chain (gamma(c)) by several cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15.',\n",

These synergistic effects were analyzed at the functional level by using TS1beta, a murine T cell line endogenously expressing the common cytokine gamma gene and transfected with the human IL-2Rbeta gene. At the receptor level, we show that expression of human IL-2Rbeta is absolutely required to obtain synergistic effects, whereas IL-2Ralpha specifically impedes the synergistic effects obtained with IL-2. The results suggest that overexpression of IL-2Ralpha inhibits p1-30R formation in the presence of IL-2. Finally, concerning the molecular effects, although p1-30 alone induces the antiapoptotic molecule bcl-2, we show that it does not influence mRNA expression of c-myc, c-jun, and c-fos oncogenes. In contrast, p1-30 enhances IL-2-driven expression of these oncogenes. Our data suggest that p1-30R (IL-2Rbeta)(2) and intermediate affinity IL-2R (IL-2Rbetagamma), when simultaneously expressed at the cell surface, may induce complementary signal transduction pathways and act in synergy.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The cloning and characterization of the human melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) and the demonstration that normal human melanocytes respond to the melanocortins, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), with increased proliferation and eumelanogenesis had put an end to a long-standing controversy about the role of melanocortins in regulating human cutaneous pigmentation. We have shown that alpha-MSH and ACTH bind the human MC1R with equal affinity, and are equipotent in their mitogenic and melanogenic effects on human melanocytes. We also showed that the activation of the MC1R is important for the melanogenic response of human melanocytes to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The MC1R is also the principal mediator of the inhibitory effects of agouti signaling protein (ASP) on melanogenesis. Expression of the MC1R is subject to regulation by its own ligands alpha-MSH and ACTH, as well as by UVR and endothelin-1. Recent studies that we conducted on the expression of MC1R variants by human melanocytes and the implications of these variants on the function of the MC1R revealed the following. Human melanocytes homozygous for Arg160Trp mutation in the MC1R demonstrated a significantly reduced response to alpha-MSH. Also, this culture responded poorly to ASP and exhibited an exaggerated cytotoxic response to UVR. Another culture, which was homozygous for Val92Met mutation in the MC1R, demonstrated a normal response to alpha-MSH. Heterozygous mutations that are frequently expressed in various melanocyte cultures did not disrupt MC1R function. These results begin to elucidate the significance of MC1R variants in the function of the receptor. Our data emphasize the significance of a normally functioning MC1R in the response of melanocytes to melanocortins, ASP, and UVR.',\n",

The DCC (for deleted in colorectal cancer) protein was proposed as a receptor for netrin-1 in the light of many observations including the inhibition of netrin-1-mediated axon outgrowth and attraction in the presence of an anti-DCC antiserum, the similitude of nervous system defects in DCC and netrin-1 knockout mice and the results of receptor swapping experiments. Previous studies have failed to show a direct interaction of DCC with netrin-1 (ref. 10), suggesting the possibility of an additional receptor or co-receptor. Here we show that DCC interacts with the membrane-associated adenosine A2b receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor that induces cAMP accumulation on binding adenosine. We show that A2b is actually a netrin-1 receptor and induces cAMP accumulation on binding netrin-1. Finally, we show that netrin-1-dependent outgrowth of dorsal spinal cord axons directly involves A2b. Together our results indicate that the growth-promoting function of netrin-1 may require a receptor complex containing DCC and A2b.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Laminins are a family of trimeric glycoproteins present in the extracellular matrix and the major constituents of basement membranes. Integrins are alpha beta transmembrane receptors that play critical roles in both cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. Several members of the integrin family, including alpha 1 beta 1, alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 3 beta 1, alpha 6 beta 1, alpha 7 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4 heterodimers serve as laminin receptors on a variety of cell types. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the involvement of individual integrins in cell interactions with laminins and the roles of laminin-binding integrins in adhesion-mediated events in vertebrates, including embryonic development, cell migration and tumor cell invasiveness, cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as basement membrane assembly. We discuss the regulation of integrin function via alternative splicing of cytoplasmic domains of alpha and beta subunits of the integrin receptors for laminins and present examples of functional collaboration between laminin-binding integrins and non-integrin laminin receptors. Advances in our understanding of the laminin-binding integrins continue to demonstrate the essential roles these receptors play in maintaining cell polarity and tissue architecture.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"On the basis of the patterns of conserved amino acid sequence, the angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor belongs to the family of serpentine receptors, which relay signals from extracellular stimuli to heterotrimeric G proteins. However, the AT(2) receptor signal transduction mechanisms are poorly understood. We have measured AT(2)-triggered activation of purified heterotrimeric proteins in urea-extracted membranes from cultured COS-7 cells expressing the recombinant receptor. This procedure removes contaminating GTP-binding proteins without inactivating the serpentine receptor. Binding studies using [(125)I] angiotensin (Ang) II revealed a single binding site with a K(d)=0.45 and a capacity of 627 fmol/mg protein in the extracted membranes. The AT(2) receptor caused a rapid activation of alpha(i) and alpha(o) but not of alpha(q) and alpha(s), as measured by radioactive guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS) binding. Activation required the presence of activated receptors, betagamma, and alpha subunits. As a first step aimed at developing an in vitro assay to examine AT(2) receptor pharmacology, we tested a battery of Ang II-related ligands for their ability to promote AT(1) or AT(2) receptor-catalyzed G(i) activation. Two proteolytic fragments of Ang II, Ang III and Ang1-7, also promoted activation of alpha(i) through the AT(2) receptor. Furthermore, we found that [Sar(1),Ala(8)]Ang II is an antagonist for both AT(1) and AT(2) receptors and that CPG42112 behaves as a partial agonist for the AT(2) receptor. In combination with previous observations, these results show that the AT(2) receptor is fully capable of activating G(i) and provides a new tool for exploring AT(2) receptor pharmacology and interactions with G-protein trimers.\",\n",

HK-1 has several biological activities that are similar to the most studied tachykinin, substance P, such as induction of plasma extravasation and mast cell degranulation.

HK-1 stimulated the proliferation of interleukin 7-expanded B cell precursors, whereas substance P had no effect. HK-1, but not substance P, promoted the survival of freshly isolated bone marrow B lineage cells or cultured, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated pre-B cells. N-acetyl-L-trytophan-3,5-bistrifluromethyl benzyl ester, a tachykinin receptor antagonist, increased apoptosis of these cells and in vivo administration of this antagonist led to specific reductions of the B220lowCD43 population (the pre-B cell compartment) in the bone marrow and the IgMhighIgDlow population (the newly generated B cells) in the spleen.

       "  'Abstract': 'FGF2 is a crucial mitogen for neural precursor cells in the developing cerebral cortex. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are thought to play a role in cortical neurogenesis by regulating the action of FGF2 on neural precursor cells. In this article, we present data indicating that glypican-4 (K-glypican), a GPI-anchored cell surface HSPG, is involved in these processes. In the developing mouse brain, glypican-4 mRNA is expressed predominantly in the ventricular zone of the telencephalon. Neither the outer layers of the telencephalic wall nor the ventricular zone of other parts of the developing brain express significant levels of glypican-4, with the exception of the ventricular zone of the tectum. In cultures of E13 rat cortical precursor cells, glypican-4 is expressed in cells immunoreactive for nestin and the D1.1 antigen, markers of neural precursor cells. Glypican-4 expression was not detected in early postmitotic or fully differentiated neurons. Recombinant glypican-4 produced in immortalized neural precursor cells binds FGF2 through its heparan sulfate chains and suppressed the mitogenic effect of FGF2 on E13 cortical precursor cells. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of glypican-4 in the developing cerebral wall significantly overlaps with that of FGF2. These results suggest that glypican-4 plays a critical role in the regulation of FGF2 action during cortical neurogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a large family of structurally related proteins with a wide range of physiological and pathological activities. Signal transduction requires association of FGF with its receptor tyrosine kinase (FGFR) and heparan sulphate proteoglycan in a specific complex on the cell surface. Direct involvement of the heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide in the molecular association between FGF and its receptor is essential for biological activity. Although crystal structures of binary complexes of FGF-heparin and FGF-FGFR have been described, the molecular architecture of the FGF signalling complex has not been elucidated. Here we report the crystal structure of the FGFR2 ectodomain in a dimeric form that is induced by simultaneous binding to FGF1 and a heparin decasaccharide. The complex is assembled around a central heparin molecule linking two FGF1 ligands into a dimer that bridges between two receptor chains. The asymmetric heparin binding involves contacts with both FGF1 molecules but only one receptor chain. The structure of the FGF1-FGFR2-heparin ternary complex provides a structural basis for the essential role of heparan sulphate in FGF signalling.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The beta2 (CD18) leukocyte integrins play a key role in normal and inflammatory immune responses. In resting leukocytes, these receptors do not bind ligands. However, when leukocytes are exposed to an appropriate agonist, high-affinity ligand binding is achieved, presumably as a result of conformational changes in the integrin. In this study, we describe a novel monoclonal antibody, mAb 6C1, directed against the alphaM subunit, which directly induces adhesion of alphaMbeta2-transfected CHO cells to fibrinogen, ICAM-1, and iC3b. Induction of binding could also be accomplished by monovalent Fab fragments of mAb 6C1 at concentrations similar to that observed with intact IgG, demonstrating stimulation of adhesion was not because of receptor cross-linking at the cell surface. The binding of mAb 6C1 induces conformational changes in the receptor, as evidenced by the expression of an \"activation reporter\" epitope recognized by mAb 24. The binding of mAb 6C1 is modulated by divalent cations. Mn2+ promoted high levels of 6C1 binding, and Mg2+ supported low levels of binding, however Ca2+ failed to support binding. A unique distinction of mAb 6C1 is localization of its epitope to the alphaM I domain. The alphaM I domain is essential for ligand binding, can directly bind divalent cations, and participates in the regulation of alphaMbeta2 ligand-binding affinity. Thus, these studies have identified a novel alphaM I domain activation epitope of alphaMbeta2 and support the idea that the I domain modulates the activational state of the beta2 integrins.',\n",

Using a cell line expressing CC chemokine receptor (CCR)5 as a bioassay, we isolated from human hemofiltrate an HCC-1 variant lacking the first eight amino acids. HCC-1[9-74] was a potent agonist of CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 and promoted calcium flux and chemotaxis of T lymphoblasts, monocytes, and eosinophils. It also blocked entry of HIV-1 strains using CCR5 as coreceptor. Limited tryptic digestion of HCC-1 generated the active variant. Conditioned media from several tumor cell lines activated HCC-1 with a high efficiency, and this activity could be inhibited by serine protease inhibitors. Our results indicate that HCC-1 represents a nonfunctional precursor that can be rapidly converted to the active chemokine by proteolytic processing. This process represents an additional mechanism by which tumor cells might generate chemoattractant molecules and recruit inflammatory cells. It might also affect HIV-1 replication in infected individuals and play an important role in AIDS pathogenesis.',\n",

Although Con A-activated splenocytes from IL-12R beta 2(-/-) mice still bind IL-12 with both high and low affinity, no IL-12-induced biological functions can be detected. Con A-activated splenocytes of IL-12R beta 2(-/-) mice failed to produce IFN-gamma or proliferate in response to IL-12 stimulation. NK lytic activity of IL-12R beta 2(-/-) splenocytes was not induced when incubated with IL-12. IL-12R beta 2(-/-) splenocytes were deficient in IFN-gamma secretion when stimulated with either Con A or anti-CD3 mAb in vitro. Furthermore, IL-12R beta 2(-/-) mice were deficient in vivo in their ability to produce IFN-gamma following endotoxin administration and to generate a type 1 cytokine response. IL-12-mediated signal transduction was also defective as measured by phosphorylation of STAT4. These results demonstrate that although mouse IL-12R beta 1 is the subunit primarily responsible for binding IL-12, IL-12R beta 2 plays an essential role in mediating the biological functions of IL-12 in mice.',\n",

Among these nociceptin analogs containing the RK triple repeat, [Arg-Lys(6-7)]- and [Arg-Lys(10-11)]nociceptins exhibited weak activities (6-9 and 60-90% of nociceptin, respectively) both in the receptor binding assay and in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding functional assay.

       "  'Abstract': 'The endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) is an endothelial cell-specific transmembrane protein that binds both protein C and activated protein C (APC). EPCR regulates the protein C anticoagulant pathway by binding protein C and augmenting protein C activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. EPCR is homologous to the MHC class 1/CD1 family, members of which contain two alpha-helices that sit upon an 8-stranded beta-sheet platform. In this study, we identified 10 residues that, when mutated to alanine, result in the loss of protein C/APC binding (Arg-81, Leu-82, Val-83, Glu-86, Arg-87, Phe-146, Tyr-154, Thr-157, Arg-158, and Glu-160). Glutamine substitutions at the four N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites of EPCR have little affect on APC binding, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties of EPCR are not critical for ligand recognition. We then mapped the epitopes for four anti-human EPCR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), two of which block EPCR/Fl-APC (APC labeled at the active site with fluorescein) interactions, whereas two do not. These epitopes were localized by generating human-mouse EPCR chimeric proteins, since the mAbs under investigation do not recognize mouse EPCR. We found that 5 of the 10 candidate residues for protein C/APC binding (Arg-81, Leu-82, Val-83, Glu-86, Arg-87) colocalize with the epitope for one of the blocking mAbs. Three-dimensional molecular modeling of EPCR indicates that the 10 protein C/APC binding candidate residues are clustered at the distal end of the two alpha-helical segments. Protein C activation studies on 293 cells that coexpress EPCR variants and thrombomodulin demonstrate that protein C binding to EPCR is necessary for the EPCR-dependent enhancement in protein activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. These studies indicate that EPCR has exploited the MHC class 1 fold for an alternative and possibly novel mode of ligand recognition. These studies are also the first to identify the protein C/APC binding region of EPCR and may provide useful information about molecular defects in EPCR that could contribute to cardiovascular disease susceptibility.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'To elucidate the molecular basis for the interaction of ligands with the human melanocortin-4 receptor (hMC4R), agonist structure-activity studies and receptor point mutagenesis were performed. Structure-activity studies of [Nle(4), D-Phe(7)]-alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (NDP-MSH) identified D-Phe7-Arg8-Trp9 as the minimal NDP-MSH fragment that possesses full agonist efficacy at the hMC4R. In an effort to identify receptor residues that might interact with amino acids in this tripeptide sequence 24 hMC4R transmembrane (TM) residues were mutated (the rationale for choosing specific receptor residues for mutation is outlined in the Results section). Mutation of TM3 residues D122 and D126 and TM6 residues F261 and H264 decreased the binding affinity of NDP-MSH 5-fold or greater, thereby identifying these receptor residues as sites potentially involved in the sought after ligand-receptor interactions. By examination of the binding affinities and potencies of substituted NDP-MSH peptides at receptor mutants, evidence was found that core melanocortin peptide residue Arg8 interacts at a molecular level with hMC4R TM3 residue D122. TM3 mutations were also observed to decrease the binding of hMC4R antagonists. Notably, mutation of TM3 residue D126 to alanine decreased the binding affinity of AGRP (87-132), a C-terminal derivative of the endogenous melanocortin antagonist, 8-fold, and simultaneous mutations D122A/D126A completely abolished AGRP (87-132) binding. In addition, mutation of TM3 residue D122 or D126 decreased the binding affinity of hMC4R antagonist SHU 9119. These results provide further insight into the molecular determinants of hMC4R ligand binding.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A solution structure for the complete zymogen form of human coagulation protein C is modeled. The initial core structure is based on the x-ray crystallographic structure of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-domainless activated form. The Gla domain (residues 1-48) is modeled from the x-ray crystal coordinates of the factor VII(a)/tissue factor complex and oriented with the epidermal growth factor-1 domain to yield an initial orientation consistent with the x-ray crystal structure of porcine factor IX(a). The missing C-terminal residues in the light chain (residues 147-157) and the activation peptide residues 158-169 were introduced using homology modeling so that the activation peptide residues directly interact with the residues in the calcium binding loop. Molecular dynamics simulations (Amber-particle-mesh-Ewald) are used to obtain the complete calcium-complexed solution structure. The individual domain structures of protein C in solution are largely unaffected by solvation, whereas the Gla-epidermal growth factor-1 orientation evolves to a form different from both factors VII(a) and IX(a). The solution structure of the zymogen protein C is compared with the crystal structures of the existing zymogen serine proteases: chymotrypsinogen, proproteinase, and prethrombin-2. Calculated electrostatic potential surfaces support the involvement of the serine protease calcium ion binding loop in providing a suitable electrostatic environment around the scissile bond for II(a)/thrombomodulin interaction.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A novel monocyte chemotactic factor, a cross-linked homodimer of S19 ribosomal protein (RP S19) was initially isolated from a rheumatoid arthritis synovial lesion. The RP S19 dimer causes the monocyte specific chemotaxis in vitro and the monocyte predominant infiltration in vivo, via its agonistic and antagonistic effects on the C5a receptors of monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, respectively. The agonistic effect is attributed to the similarity of regional structures between RP S19 and C5a, the complement C5-derived leukocyte chemotactic factor, although overall homology of the amino acid sequence between these molecules is only 4%. The antagonistic effect depends upon the C-terminal portion of RP S19. The RP S19 dimer is produced and released by apoptotic cells, and this dimer recruits monocytes from the circulation to the apoptotic lesion. The infiltrated monocytes/macrophages engulf the apoptotic cells, translocate to regional lymph nodes via lymphatics and present the antigenic information of the apoptotic cells to the T cell repertoire. In this manner, the apoptotic cell clearance system connects to the acquired immune system. The innate and acquired immune mechanisms, mediated by the RP S19 dimer, participate in the pathology of inveterate chronic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes express a different repertoire of chemokine receptors (CCRs). CXCR3, the receptor for I-TAC (interferon-inducible T cell alpha-chemoattractant), Mig (monokine induced by gamma-interferon), and IP10 (interferon-inducible protein 10), is expressed preferentially on Th1 cells, whereas CCR3, the receptor for eotaxin and several other CC chemokines, is characteristic of Th2 cells. While studying responses that are mediated by these two receptors, we found that the agonists for CXCR3 act as antagonists for CCR3. I-TAC, Mig, and IP10 compete for the binding of eotaxin to CCR3-bearing cells and inhibit migration and Ca(2+) changes induced in such cells by stimulation with eotaxin, eotaxin-2, MCP-2 (monocyte chemottractant protein-2), MCP-3, MCP-4, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted). A hybrid chemokine generated by substituting the first eight NH(2)-terminal residues of eotaxin with those of I-TAC bound CCR3 with higher affinity than eotaxin or I-TAC (3- and 10-fold, respectively). The hybrid was 5-fold more potent than I-TAC as an inhibitor of eotaxin activity and was effective at concentrations as low as 5 nm. None of the antagonists described induced the internalization of CCR3, indicating that they lack agonistic effects and thus qualify as pure antagonists. These results suggest that chemokines that attract Th1 cells via CXCR3 can concomitantly block the migration of Th2 cells in response to CCR3 ligands, thus enhancing the polarization of T cell recruitment.',\n",

This receptor is widely distributed in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract; target disruption leads to obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, however, its role in physiological and pathological processes remain unknown due to lack of selective ligands or identification of its natural ligand. We have recently discovered (Mantey, S. A., Weber, H. C., Sainz, E., Akeson, M., Ryan, R. R. Pradhan, T. K., Searles, R. P., Spindel, E. R., Battey, J. F., Coy, D. H., and Jensen, R. T. (1997) J.

However, use of this ligand is limited because it has high affinity for all known Bn receptors. In the present study we have attempted to identify BRS-3 selective ligands using a strategy of rational peptide design with the substitution of conformationally restricted amino acids into the prototype ligand [d-Tyr(6),beta-Ala(11),Phe(13),Nle(14)]Bn-(6-14) or its d-Phe(6) analogue. Each of the 22 peptides synthesized had binding affinities determined for hBRS-3, hGRPR, and hNMBR, and hBRS-3 selective ligands were tested for their ability to activate phospholipase C and increase inositol phosphates ([(3)H]inositol phosphate). Using this approach we have identified a number of BRS-3 selective ligands. These ligands functioned as receptor agonists and their binding affinities were reflected in their potencies for altering [(3)H]inositol phosphate. Two peptides with an (R)- or (S)-amino-3-phenylpropionic acid substitution for beta-Ala(11) in the prototype ligand had the highest selectivity for the hBRS-3 over the mammalian Bn receptors and did not interact with receptors for other gastrointestinal hormones/neurotransmitters. Molecular modeling demonstrated these two selective BRS-3 ligands had a unique conformation of the position 11 beta-amino acid. This selectivity was of sufficient magnitude that these should be useful in explaining the role of hBRS-3 activation in obesity, glucose homeostasis, hypertension, and other physiological or pathological processes.',\n",

CD100 stimulation significantly enhanced the effects of CD40 on B cell responses. Administration of soluble CD100 markedly accelerated in vivo antigen-specific antibody responses.

Expression cloning revealed that the CD100 receptor on lymphocytes is CD72, a negative regulator of B cell responsiveness. CD72 thus represents a novel class of semaphorin receptors. CD100 stimulation induced tyrosine dephosphorylation of CD72 and dissociation of SHP-1 from CD72.

The inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), associated with different mutations in RET, is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma. GDNF signals via GFRalpha1, neurturin via GFRalpha2, artemin via GFRalpha3, whereas the mammalian GFRalpha receptor for persephin (PSPN) is unknown. Here we characterize the human GFRalpha4 as the ligand-binding subunit required together with RET for PSPN signaling. Human and mouse GFRalpha4 lack the first Cys-rich domain characteristic of other GFRalpha receptors. Unlabeled PSPN displaces (125)I-PSPN from GFRA4-transfected cells, which express endogenous Ret. PSPN can be specifically cross-linked to mammalian GFRalpha4 and Ret, and is able to promote autophosphorylation of Ret in GFRA4-transfected cells. PSPN, but not other GDNF family ligands, promotes the survival of cultured sympathetic neurons microinjected with GFRA4. We identified different splice forms of human GFRA4 mRNA encoding for two glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked and one putative soluble isoform that were predominantly expressed in the thyroid gland. Overlapping expression of RET and GFRA4 but not other GFRA mRNAs in normal and malignant thyroid medullary cells suggests that GFRalpha4 may restrict the MEN2 syndrome to these cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; CCL5) binds selectively to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate. The primary sequence of RANTES contains two clusters of basic residues, (44)RKNR(47) and (55)KKWVR(59). The first is a BBXB motif common in heparin-binding proteins, and the second is located in the loop directly preceding the C-terminal helix. We have mutated these residues to alanine, both as point mutations as well as triple mutations of the 40s and 50s clusters. Using a binding assay to heparin beads with radiolabeled proteins, the (44)AANA(47) mutant demonstrated an 80% reduction in its capacity to bind heparin, whereas the (55)AAWVA(59) mutant retained full binding capacity. Mutation of the (44)RKNR(47) site reduced the selectivity of RANTES binding to different GAGs. The mutants were tested for their integrity by receptor binding assays on CCR1 and CCR5 as well as their ability to induce chemotaxis in vitro. In all assays the single point mutations and the triple 50s cluster mutation caused no significant difference in activity compared with the wild type sequence. However, the triple 40s mutant showed a 80-fold reduction in affinity for CCR1, despite normal binding to CCR5. It was only able to induce monocyte chemotaxis at micromolar concentrations. The triple 40s mutant was also able to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity, but consistent with its abrogated GAG binding capacity, it no longer induced enhanced infectivity at high concentrations.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a potent insulinotropic hormone currently under study as a therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes. Since an understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to high-affinity receptor (R) binding and activation may facilitate the development of more potent GLP-1R agonists, we have localized specific regions of GLP-1R required for binding. The purified N-terminal fragment (hereafter referred to as NT) of the GLP-1R produced in either insect (Sf9) or mammalian (COS-7) cells was shown to bind GLP-1. The physical interaction of NT with GLP-1 was first demonstrated by cross-linking ((125)I-GLP-1/NT complex band at approximately 28 kDa) and secondly by attachment to Ni(2+)-NTA beads. The GLP-1R NT protein attached to beads bound GLP-1, but with lower affinity (inhibitory concentration (IC(50)): 4.5 x 10(-7) M) than wild-type (WT) GLP-1R (IC(50): 5.2 x 10(-9)M). The low affinity of GLP-1R NT suggested that other receptor domains may contribute to GLP-1 binding. This was supported by studies using chimeric glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptors. GIP(1-151)/GLP-1R, but not GIP(1-222)/GLP-1R, exhibited specific GLP-1 binding and GLP-1-induced cAMP production, suggesting that the region encompassing transmembrane (TM) domain 1 through to TM3 was required for binding. Since it was hypothesized that certain charged or polar amino acids in this region might be involved in binding, these residues (TM2-TM3) were analyzed by substitution mutagenesis. Five mutants (K197A, D198A, K202A, D215A, R227A) displayed remarkably reduced binding affinity. These studies indicate that the NT domain of the GLP-1R is able to bind GLP-1, but charged residues concentrated at the distal TM2/extracellular loop-1 (EC1) interface (K197, D198, K202) and in EC1 (D215 and R227) probably contribute to the binding determinants of the GLP-1R.',\n",

In Rat1 and Balb/c3T3 fibroblasts and in neurons the IGF-I receptor is coupled to an inhibitory G protein, G(i), which mediates G(beta)gamma-dependent MAP kinase activation. The present study determined whether in normal human intestinal smooth muscle cells the IGF-I receptor activates a heterotrimeric G protein and the role of G protein activation in mediating IGF-I-induced growth. IGF-I elicited IGF-I receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in the specific activation of G(i2). G(beta)gamma subunits selectively mediated IGF-I-dependent MAP kinase activation; G(alpha)i2 subunits selectively mediated IGF-I-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. IGF-I-stimulated MAP kinase activation and growth were inhibited by pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of G(i)/G(o) activation. Cyclic AMP inhibits growth of human intestinal muscle cells. IGF-I inhibited both basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. This inhibition was attenuated in the presence of pertussis toxin. IGF-I stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, in contrast to MAP kinase activation, occurred independently of G(i2) activation. These data suggest that IGF-I specifically activates G(i2), resulting in concurrent G(beta)gamma-dependent stimulation of MAP kinase activity and growth, and G(alpha)i2-dependent inhibition of cAMP levels resulting in disinhibition of cAMP-mediated growth suppression.',\n",

Competitive binding studies using unlabeled agonists and antagonists with hCRF(1) and hCRF(2alpha) receptors revealed that most agonists exhibited higher affinity in displacing agonist radioligands compared with displacement of antagonist radioligands. Exceptions were the agonists human and rat urocortin, which displayed high-affinity binding in the presence of either (125)I-labeled agonist or antagonist ligands. In contrast, the affinities of antagonists were independent of the nature of the radioligand. We also found that, in contrast to the mammalian CRF receptors, the affinity of ligand binding to xCRF(1) and xCRF(2) receptors strongly depended on the nature of the radioligand used for competition. For xCRF(1), competitors showed different rank order binding profiles with (125)I-CRF compared with (125)I-AST as the displaceable ligand. Similarly, binding of competitors to the xCRF(2) receptor showed markedly different profiles with (125)I-CRF as the competed ligand compared with the other radioligands.

Studies suggest that Lu gps may contribute to vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease and it has recently been shown that sickle cells adhere to laminin isoforms containing the alpha5 chain (laminin 10/11). Laminin alpha5 is present in the subendothelium and is also a constituent of bone marrow sinusoids, suggesting a role for the Lu/laminin interaction in erythropoiesis. The objectives of the current study were to define more precisely the molecular interactions of the extracellular and intracellular regions of human Lu and to clone and characterize a mouse homologue. To this end, complementary DNA and genomic clones for the mouse homologue were sequenced and the mouse Lu gene mapped to a region on chromosome 7 with conserved synteny with human 19q13.2. Mouse and human Lu gps are highly conserved (72% identity) at the amino acid sequence level and both mouse and human Lu gps specifically bind laminin 10/11 with high affinity. Furthermore, the first 3, N-terminal, immunoglobulin superfamily domains of human Lu are critical for this interaction. The results indicated that the cytoplasmic domain of BRIC 221-labeled human Lu gp is linked with the spectrin-based skeleton, affording the speculation that this interaction may be critical for signal transduction. These results further support a role for Lu gps in sickle cell disease and indicate the utility of mouse models to explore the function of Lu gp-laminin 10/11 interaction in normal erythropoiesis and in sickle cell disease.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A structure-activity study of neurokinin A (NKA) (4-10) was performed to investigate the importance of residue and chirality for affinity and efficacy at the NK(2) receptor in human colon circular muscle. Two series of NKA(4-10) analogues were produced with either L-alanine or the D-enantiomer substituted. Their activities were determined in vitro by means of radioligand binding and isolated smooth muscle pharmacology. NKA was more potent than NKA(4-10) at the human, unlike the rabbit, NK(2) receptor. The contractile response of NKA(4-10) was unaffected by N-terminal acetylation. L-Ala substitution of Asp(4), Val(7), Leu(9), and Met(10) caused an 8- to 80-fold decrease, and substitution of Phe(6) caused a 5000-fold decrease in binding affinity (P < 0.01). Positions Ser(5) and Gly(8) were not significantly affected. In functional studies, a similar pattern was observed. The replacement of residues with their respective D-enantiomer drastically reduced binding affinity and functional potency, particularly at positions 6 and 7 (P < 0.05). NKA(4-10) analogues L-Ala(6), L-Ala(8), D-Phe(6), D-Val(7), and D-Met(10) were partial agonists. An excellent correlation was observed between binding and functional data (r = 0.95). A retro-inverso analogue of NKA(4-10) was inactive. In conclusion, the side chains of Asp(4), Phe(6), Val(7), Leu(9), and Met(10) are structurally important features of NKA(4-10) for agonist activity, and changes in amino acid chirality are detrimental to binding affinity and functional activity. Overall, our data are broadly similar to those of previous studies in the rat. However, at the human NK(2) receptor, unlike the rat, [Ala(8)]NKA(4-10) was an antagonist.',\n",

Pretreatment of these cells with anti-CXCR2 did not inhibit the chemotactic response to GRO-alpha. In addition, nonactivated and NA cells responded to fractalkine, although they lack the expression of CX(3)CR1. This activity was not inhibited by anti-CX(3)CR1. Viral macrophage inflammatory protein (vMIP)-I, I-309, and TARC competed with the binding of (125)I-309 to AD cells with varying affinities. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 but not any other cytokine or chemokine examined including interferon (IFN)-gamma, MIP-3beta, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) or I-309, up-regulated the expression of CXCR3 and CXCR4 on NK cell surface. This is correlated with increased chemotaxis of NK cells treated with TGF-beta1 toward stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10). Messenger RNA for lymphotactin, RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta, but not IP-10, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, IL-8, or I-309 was expressed in all 3 NK cell subsets. Our results may have implications for the dissemination of NK cells at the sites of tumor growth or viral replication. (Blood. 2001;97:367-375)',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The control of cell growth is regulated through coordinated responses to growth factors and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Integrins, the major family of cell-ECM receptors, are vital to these coordinated responses. Although much is known of the role of integrins in growth promotion, specific examples of integrin-mediated cell growth inhibition are few. On the basis of our findings that the integrin beta8 subunit is expressed in airway epithelial cells and is absent in lung cancers, we investigated the role and mechanism of the integrin alphavbeta8 in mediating growth inhibition. When introduced into either a lung or colon carcinoma cell line, beta8 inhibited cell growth without inducing apoptosis. Ligation of alphavbeta8 also induced cell rounding, inhibited focal contact formation, and initiated an inhibitory signaling pathway as demonstrated by increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1. The cytoplasmic domain of beta8 was capable of both growth inhibition and causing cell shape changes as shown by the use of a chimeric integrin construct consisting of the beta8-cytoplasmic domain coupled to the beta6-extracellular domain. Finally, when tested in vivo, beta8 potently inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. Together, these results implicate alphavbeta8 as a novel growth-regulatory molecule of epithelial cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signals through membrane-bound serine/threonine kinase receptors, which upon stimulation phosphorylate Smad proteins and thereby trigger their nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Although the three mammalian isoforms of TGF-beta are highly homologous at the level of sequence, analysis of their in vivo function by gene knockouts revealed striking differences, suggesting no significant functional redundancy between TGF-beta1, -2 and -3. While signal transduction by TGF-beta1 has been well characterized, receptor binding and activation by the TGF-beta2 isoform is less well understood. Here, we show that TbetaRII-B, an alternatively spliced variant of the TGF-beta type II receptor, is a TGF-beta2 binding receptor, which mediates signalling via the Smad pathway in the absence of any TGF-beta type III receptor (TbetaRIII). L6 cells lacking endogenous TbetaRIII as well as TbetaRII-B do not respond to TGF-beta2. Transfection of these cells with TbetaRII-B restores TGF-beta2 sensitivity. The expression of TbetaRII-B is restricted to cells originating from tissues such as bone where the isoform TGF-beta2 has a predominant role. This reflects the importance of this receptor in TGF-beta isoform-specific signalling.',\n",

We further demonstrate that the endostatin-integrin interaction is of functional significance in vitro, as we found that immobilized endostatin supports endothelial cell survival and migration in an integrin-dependent manner. Soluble endostatin in turn inhibits integrin-dependent endothelial cell functions, such as cell migration.

Currently, there is considerable controversy over the degree of glomerular permeability to albumin. After filtration, however, albumin binds to megalin and cubulin, two giant receptors in the apical membrane of proximal tubular cells. Albumin is subsequently re-absorbed by proximal tubular cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, a process subject to complex regulation. The interaction of albumin with proximal tubule cells also leads to the generation of intracellular signals.

       "  'Abstract': 'Chemokines appear to have an important role in the seeding of lymphoid progenitors in the thymus, the regulation of the coordinated movements of the maturing T cells within this organ, and the egress of the resulting naive T cells to secondary lymphoid organs. CCR9, the specific receptor for the beta-chemokine TECK/CCL25, is selectively expressed in thymus, lymph node, and spleen. Using a specific anti-CCR9 polyclonal antibody, K629, and a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction procedure, a detailed study of CCR9 expression in the thymus and secondary lymphoid organs was performed. The results show that CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes have the highest CCR9 expression in thymus. Single-positive CD8(+) thymocytes continue to express this receptor after abandoning the thymus as mature naive T cells, as suggested by the existence of a CD8(+)CD69(low)CD62L(high) CCR9(+) cell subset. Consistent with this, CD8(+) lymphocytes from lymph nodes, spleen, and Peyer patches express a functional CCR9, as its expression correlates with migration in response to CCL25. Conversely, CD4(+) thymocytes lose CCR9 before abandoning the thymus, and CD4(+) T cells from secondary lymphoid organs also lack CCR9 expression. Analysis of CCR9 expression in thymocytes from mice of different ages showed that CCR9 levels are affected by age, as this receptor is more abundant, and its response to CCL25 is more potent in newborn animals. Collectively, these results suggest that CCR9 has a role in thymocyte development throughout murine life, with clear differences between the CD4(+) and CD8(+) lineages.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The tuberoinfundibular peptide TIP39 [TIP-(1-39)], which exhibits only limited amino acid sequence homology with PTH and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), stimulates cAMP accumulation in cells expressing the PTH2 receptor (PTH2R), but it is inactive at the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R). However, when using either (125)I-labeled rat [Nle(8,21),Tyr(34)]PTH-(1-34)amide (rPTH) or (125)I-labeled human [Tyr(36)]PTHrP-(1-36)amide [PTHrP-(1-36)] for radioreceptor studies, TIP-(1-39) bound to LLCPK(1) cells stably expressing the PTH1R (HKrk-B7 cells), albeit with weak apparent affinity (243 +/- 52 and 210 +/- 64 nM, respectively). In comparison to the parent peptide, the apparent binding affinity of TIP-(3-39) was about 3-fold higher, and that of TIP-(9-39) was about 5.5-fold higher. However, despite their improved IC(50) values at the PTH1R, both truncated peptides failed to stimulate cAMP accumulation in HKrk-B7 cells. In contrast, the chimeric peptide PTHrP-(1-20)/TIP-(23-39) bound to HKrk-B7 cells with affinities of 31 +/- 8.2 and 11 +/- 4.0 nM when using radiolabeled rPTH and PTHrP-(1-36), respectively, and it stimulated cAMP accumulation in HKrk-B7 and SaOS-2 cells with potencies (EC(50), 1.40 +/- 0.3 and 0.38 +/- 0.12 nM, respectively) and efficacies (maximum levels, 39 +/- 8 and 31 +/- 3 pmol/well, respectively) similar to those of PTH-(1-34) and PTHrP-(1-36). In both cell lines, TIP(9-39) and, to a lesser extent, TIP-(1-39) inhibited the actions of the three agonists with efficiencies similar to those of [Leu(11),D-Trp(12),Trp(23),Tyr(36)]PTHrP-(7-36)amide, an established PTH1R antagonist. Taken together, the currently available data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal portion of TIP-(1-39) interacts efficiently with the PTH1R, at sites identical to or closely overlapping those used by PTH-(1-34) and PTHrP-(1-36). The amino-terminal residues of TIP-(1-39), however, are unable to interact productively with the PTH1R, thus enabling TIP-(1-39) and some of its truncated analogs to function as an antagonist at this receptor.',\n",

Moreover, FPRL1 is expressed at high levels by inflammatory cells infiltrating senile plaques in brain tissues from AD patients.

Adhesion of myeloma cells to A9dis was completely inhibited by an antibody to the alpha(v)beta(5) integrin but not by antibodies to other subunits.

In contrast, orexin-B, a peptide containing 28 amino acids without disulfide bond, which has no stimulatory action of gastric acid. The objective of the present study was to characterize the receptor-mediated mechanism of orexin-A-induced stimulation of gastric acid secretion using orexin-A-related peptides with modification of disulfide bonds. Intracisternal injection of orexin-A, but not orexin-B or orexin-A (15-33), that does not contain both disulfide bonds stimulated gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated conscious rats. The ability of the stimulation of gastric acid output was less in three alanine-substituted orexin-A, [Ala(6,12)]orexin-A, [Ala(7,14)]orexin-A, and [Ala(6,7,12,14)]orexin-A, than orexin-A. Orexins-induced calcium increase was measured in CHO-K1 cells expressing OX1R or OX2R. Orexin-A induced a transient increase in [Ca(2+)]i in CHO-K1/OX1R cells in a dose-dependent manner. EC50 values for OX1R of orexin-A, orexin-B, or orexin-A (15-33) was 0.068, 0.69 or 4.1 nM, respectively, suggesting that peptides containing no disulfide bonds have lower potency for the receptor. Agonistic activity for OX1R of the three orexin-A analogues with modification of one or both disulfide bonds was significantly reduced as compared with that of orexin-A. EC50 values for OX2R of orexin-A and orexin-B was almost equal but potency for the receptor of orexin-A (15-33) and three alanine substituted orexin-A was less than that of orexin-A. A significant inverse relationship between gastric acid output and EC50 values for OX1R, but not OX2R, was observed. These results suggested that the orexin-A-induced acid stimulation requires OX1R activation and that disulfide bonds in orexin-A may have a key role in the receptor activation.',\n",

Analysis of Nogo-A has shown that an axon-inhibiting domain of 66 amino acids is expressed at the extracellular surface and at the endoplasmic reticulum lumen of transfected cells and oligodendrocytes. The acidic amino terminus of Nogo-A is detected at the cytosolic face of cellular membranes and may contribute to inhibition of axon regeneration at sites of oligodendrocyte injury. Here we show that the extracellular domain of Nogo (Nogo-66) inhibits axonal extension, but does not alter non-neuronal cell morphology. In contrast, a multivalent form of the N terminus of Nogo-A affects the morphology of both neurons and other cell types. Here we identify a brain-specific, leucine-rich-repeat protein with high affinity for soluble Nogo-66. Cleavage of the Nogo-66 receptor and other glycophosphatidylinositol-linked proteins from axonal surfaces renders neurons insensitive to Nogo-66. Nogo-66 receptor expression is sufficient to impart Nogo-66 axonal inhibition to unresponsive neurons.

We show here that a seven-transmembrane receptor, CRTH2, which is preferentially expressed in T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, eosinophils, and basophils in humans, serves as the novel receptor for PGD2. In response to PGD2, CRTH2 induces intracellular Ca2+mobilization and chemotaxis in Th2 cells in a Galphai-dependent manner. In addition, CRTH2, but not DP, mediates PGD2-dependent cell migration of blood eosinophils and basophils.

       "  'Abstract': 'Here we describe the cloning and initial characterization of a previously unidentified CRF-related neuropeptide, urocortin II (Ucn II). Searches of the public human genome database identified a region with significant sequence homology to the CRF neuropeptide family. By using homologous primers deduced from the human sequence, a mouse cDNA was isolated from whole brain poly(A)(+) RNA that encodes a predicted 38-aa peptide, structurally related to the other known mammalian family members, CRF and Ucn. Ucn II binds selectively to the type 2 CRF receptor (CRF-R2), with no appreciable activity on CRF-R1. Transcripts encoding Ucn II are expressed in discrete regions of the rodent central nervous system, including stress-related cell groups in the hypothalamus (paraventricular and arcuate nuclei) and brainstem (locus coeruleus). Central administration of 1-10 microg of peptide elicits activational responses (Fos induction) preferentially within a core circuitry subserving autonomic and neuroendocrine regulation, but whose overall pattern does not broadly mimic the CRF-R2 distribution. Behaviorally, central Ucn II attenuates nighttime feeding, with a time course distinct from that seen in response to CRF. In contrast to CRF, however, central Ucn II failed to increase gross motor activity. These findings identify Ucn II as a new member of the CRF family of neuropeptides, which is expressed centrally and binds selectively to CRF-R2. Initial functional studies are consistent with Ucn II involvement in central autonomic and appetitive control, but not in generalized behavioral activation.',\n",

NK(3) receptor-selective antagonists from two structural classes, had 10- to 100-fold lower binding affinities for murine NK(3) receptor compared to human NK(3) receptor, and about 5- to 10-fold reduced potency in the murine NK(3) receptor functional assay. The results demonstrate species differences in the potencies of tachykinin receptor antagonists in murine and human NK(3) receptors, and the lower potencies in the former should be taken into consideration when using murine disease models.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Antagonism between GH secretagogues (GHS) and somatostatin (SRIH) has been postulated and demonstrated, but SRIH does not bind to GHS receptors (GHS-R) and potent synthetic peptidyl GHS (GHRP6, hexarelin) do not displace radiolabeled SRIH from its receptors. However, non-natural SRIH octapeptide agonists (mainly lanreotide and vapreotide) displace 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin from pituitary binding sites suggesting that an endogenous factor related to SRIH might exist and interact with GHS-R. Our aims were to investigate the ability of different SRIH-like peptides such as various SRIH fragments (SRIH 3-14, SRIH 7-14, SRIH 3-10, SRIH 7-10, SRIH 2-9) and a natural neuropeptide that shows a high structural homology with SRIH such as cortistatin-14 (CST) to compete with 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin for human pituitary binding sites and to compare their binding affinity with that of hexarelin and ghrelin, a gastric-derived peptidyl GHS that has been proposed as a natural ligand of GHS-R. While the binding of 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin to pituitary membranes was completely displaced by unlabelled hexarelin, ghrelin and CST, none of the SRIH fragments tested inhibited this binding. Ghrelin and CST exhibited a similar affinity (4.6-5.4 x 10(-7) mol/l) for the binding while hexarelin was more effective by about four orders of magnitude in displacing 125I-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin. Our data demonstrate for the first time that cortistatin, a natural peptide related to SRIH, binds to GHS-R and suggest that this factor may play a role in modulating the activity of these receptors.',\n",

In this study, we identify sialoadhesin counterreceptors on T lymphocytes. Several major glycoproteins (85, 130, 240 kDa) were precipitated by sialoadhesin-Fc fusion proteins from a murine T cell line (TK-1). Binding of sialoadhesin to these glycoproteins was sialic acid dependent and was abolished by mutation of a critical residue (R97A) of the sialic acid binding site in the membrane distal Ig-like domain of sialoadhesin. The 130- and 240-kDa sialoadhesin-binding glycoproteins were identified as the sialomucins CD43 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (CD162), respectively. CD43 expressed in COS cells supported increased binding to immobilized sialoadhesin. Finally, sialoadhesin bound different glycoforms of CD43 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, including unbranched (core 1) and branched (core 2) O:-linked glycans, that are normally found on CD43 in resting and activated T cells, respectively. These results identify CD43 as a T cell counterreceptor for sialoadhesin and suggest that in addition to its anti-adhesive role CD43 may promote cell-cell interactions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of multifunctional cytokines. BMP induces its signal to regulate growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of various cells upon trimeric complex formation with two distinct type I and type II receptors on the cell surface: both are single-transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. To identify the amino acid residues on BMP type I receptor responsible for its ligand binding, the structure-activity relationship of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the BMP type IA receptor (sBMPR-IA) was investigated by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The mutant receptors, as well as sBMPR-IA, were expressed as fusion proteins with thioredoxin in Escherichia coli, and purified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) after digestion with enterokinase. Structural analysis of the parent protein and representative mutants in solution by CD showed no detectable differences in their folding structures. The binding affinity of the mutants to BMP-4 was determined by surface plasmon resonance biosensor. All the mutant receptors examined, with the exception of Y70A, displayed reduced affinities to BMP-4 with the rank order of decreases: I52A (17-fold) approximately F75A (15-fold) >> T64A (4-fold) = T62A (4-fold) approximately E54A (3-fold). The decreases in binding affinity observed for the latter three mutants are mainly due to decreased association rate constants while alterations in rate constants both, for association and dissociation, result in the drastically reduced affinities for the former two mutants. These results allow us to conclude that sBMPR-IA recognizes the ligand using the concave face of the molecule. The major ligand-binding site of the BMP type IA receptor consists of Phe75 in loop 2 and Ile52, Glu54, Thr62 and Thr64 on the three-stranded beta-sheet. These findings should provide a general basis for the ligand/type I receptor recognition in the TGF-beta superfamily.',\n",

We investigated whether or not BTC protein is involved in the pathogenesis of human atherosclerosis. Recombinant human BTC showed a mitogenic activity on cultured human aortic SMCs by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. The immunohistochemical localization of BTC, SMCs, macrophages, EGF receptors and ErbB4 was examined in autopsied human aortas. BTC was detected in both intimal and medial SMCs of the aortic wall. The percentage of BTC-positive medial SMCs in early types of atherosclerotic lesions decreased with age, but in adult, it was significantly higher in advanced types than in early types of atherosclerotic lesions. BTC-positive SMCs were predominantly localized in the medial side of the intima. Furthermore, numerous BTC-positive SMCs and macrophages were observed around the core lesion of atherosclerotic plaques. Receptors for BTC, EGF receptor and ErbB4, were expressed on SMCs, suggesting that BTC is associated with EGF receptor family-mediated signaling.

       "  'Abstract': 'An important role of cell matrix adhesion receptors is to mediate transmembrane coupling between extracellular matrix attachment, actin reorganization, and cell spreading. Thrombospondin (TSP)-1 is a modulatory component of matrix expressed during development, immune response, or wound repair. Cell adhesion to TSP-1 involves formation of biochemically distinct matrix contacts based on stable fascin spikes. The cell surface adhesion receptors required have not been identified. We report here that antibody clustering of syndecan-1 proteoglycan specifically transduces organization of cortical actin and fascin bundles in several cell types. Transfection of COS-7 cells with syndecan-1 is sufficient to stimulate cell spreading, fascin spike assembly, and extensive protrusive lateral ruffling on TSP-1 or on syndecan-1 antibody. The underlying molecular mechanism depends on glycosaminoglycan (GAG) modification of the syndecan-1 core protein at residues S45 or S47 for cell membrane spreading and on the VC2 region of the cytoplasmic domain for spreading and fascin spike formation. Expression of the VC2 deletion mutant or GAG-negative syndecan-1 showed that syndecan-1 is necessary in spreading and fascin spike formation by C2C12 cells on TSP-1. These results establish a novel role for syndecan-1 protein in coupling a physiological matrix ligand to formation of a specific matrix contact structure.',\n",

A related molecule called DC-SIGNR exhibits 77% amino acid sequence identity with DC-SIGN. The DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR genes map within a 30-kb region on chromosome 19p13.2-3. Their strong homology and close physical location indicate a recent duplication of the original gene. Messenger RNA and protein expression patterns demonstrate that the DC-SIGN-related molecule is highly expressed on liver sinusoidal cells and in the lymph node but not on DCs, in contrast to DC-SIGN. Therefore, we suggest that a more appropriate name for the DC-SIGN-related molecule is L-SIGN, liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin. We show that in the liver, L-SIGN is expressed by sinusoidal endothelial cells. Functional studies indicate that L-SIGN behaves similarly to DC-SIGN in that it has a high affinity for ICAM-3, captures HIV-1 through gp120 binding, and enhances HIV-1 infection of T cells in trans. We propose that L-SIGN may play an important role in the interaction between liver sinusoidal endothelium and trafficking lymphocytes, as well as function in the pathogenesis of HIV-1.',\n",

This study shows that eotaxin also interacts with CCR2 and CCR5 and can, thus, affect the responses of monocytes, which express both receptors. In human monocytes pretreatment with eotaxin decreased responsiveness to MCP-1, a selective ligand for CCR2, as well as to RANTES and MIP-1 beta, which bind to CCR5. Similar effects were obtained with transfected cells expressing CCR2 or CCR5, but here a difference became apparent: Eotaxin triggered CCR5 at a concentration of 100 nM but not CCR2 even at 1 microM, suggesting an antagonistic effect on this receptor. In agreement with this observation, eotaxin induced internalization of CCR5 but not of CCR2 in human monocytes and transfected cells. Binding studies showed that eotaxin displaces (125) I-MCP-1 from monocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, and functional experiments showed that eotaxin inhibits MCP-1-induced chemotaxis and enzyme release. The results demonstrate that eotaxin is a CCR5 agonist and a CCR2 antagonist. The present findings suggest a role of eotaxin in the fine-tuning of cellular responses occurring at sites of allergic inflammation, in which both MCP-1 and eotaxin are produced.

       "  'Abstract': 'An antagonistic relationship between inhibin and activin is essential to the control of pituitary FSH release and to normal gonadal function. Two inhibin ligands, inhibin A and inhibin B, are made by the ovary in females, and each regulate pituitary FSH at different times during the reproductive cycle. Inhibin B, but not inhibin A, is produced by the testes and is therefore responsible for all inhibin-dependent FSH regulation in males. Although the activin signal transduction pathway has been well characterized, little is known about the mechanism of inhibin signaling and its relationship to activin antagonism. A recently cloned inhibin-binding protein, InhBP (p120), associates strongly with the type IB activin receptor (Alk4) in a ligand-responsive manner and interacts to a lesser extent with other activin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I and activin type II receptors. Activin stimulates the association of InhBP and Alk4, and inhibin B, but not inhibin A, interferes with InhBP-Alk4 complex formation. InhBP is necessary to mediate a specific antagonistic effect of inhibin B on activin-stimulated transcription. Appropriate stoichiometry between InhBP and the activin type I receptor is crucial to InhBP function. These findings suggest that InhBP is an inhibin B-specific receptor that mediates antagonism of activin signal transduction through the modulation of activin heteromeric receptor complex assembly.',\n",

This report describes the cloning and functional characterization of a novel second human MCH receptor, which we designate MCH(2), initially identified in a genomic survey sequence as being homologous to MCH(1) receptors. Using this sequence, a full-length cDNA was generated with an open reading frame of 1023 base pairs, encoding a polypeptide of 340 amino acids, with 38% identity to MCH(1) and with many of the structural features conserved in G protein-coupled receptors. This newly discovered receptor belongs to class 1 (rhodopsin-like) of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. HEK293 cells transfected with MCH(2) receptors responded to nanomolar concentrations of MCH with an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels and increased cellular extrusion of protons. In addition, fluorescently labeled MCH bound with nanomolar affinity to these cells. The tissue localization of MCH(2) receptor mRNA, as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, was similar to that of MCH(1) in that both receptors are expressed predominantly in the brain.

The human type I interferons, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-omega, induce somewhat different cellular effects but act through a common receptor complex, IFNAR, composed of subunits IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2. Human IFNAR-2 binds all type I IFNs but with lower affinity and different specificity than the IFNAR complex. Human IFNAR-1 has low intrinsic binding of human IFNs but strongly affects the affinity and differential ligand specificity of the IFNAR complex. Understanding IFNAR-1 interactions with the interferons is critical to elucidating the differential ligand specificity and activation by type I IFNs. However, studies of ligand interactions with human IFNAR-1 are compromised by its low affinity. The homologous bovine IFNAR-1 serendipitously binds human IFN-alphas with nanomolar affinity. Exploiting its strong binding of human IFN-alpha2, we have identified residues important for ligand binding. Mutagenesis of any of five aromatic residues of bovine IFNAR-1 caused strong decreases in ligand binding, whereas mutagenesis of proximal neutral or charged residues had smaller effects. These residues were mapped onto a homology model of IFNAR-1 to identify the ligand-binding face of IFNAR-1, which is consistent with previous structure/function studies of human IFNAR-1. The topology of IFNAR-1/IFN interactions appears novel when compared with previously studied cytokine receptors.',\n",

The IL-1HY2 gene is located in close proximity to other IL-1 family genes on human chromosome 2, and the genomic organization of the IL-1HY2 gene is highly conserved with other IL-1 family members. IL-1HY2 protein is secreted from mammalian cells, and the purified recombinant IL-1HY2 protein binds soluble IL-1 receptor type I. IL-1HY2 is expressed in human skin, spleen, and tonsil. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the IL-1HY2 protein is expressed in the basal epithelia of skin and in proliferating B cells of the tonsil. These data suggest that IL-1HY2 is a novel IL-1 family member and that it may participate in a network of IL-1 family members to regulate adapted and innate immune responses.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Interleukin-13 (IL-13), a predominantly Th2-derived cytokine, appears to play a central pathological role in asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, some parasitic infections, and cancer. We hypothesized that an IL-13 antagonist may have profound therapeutic utility in these conditions. We, therefore, mutagenized human IL-13 in which Glu at position 13 was substituted by a Lys residue. This highly purified recombinant IL-13 variant, IL-13E13K, bound with 4-fold higher affinity to the IL-13 receptor than wild-type IL-13 but retained no detectable proliferative activity on the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line. IL-13E13K competitively inhibited IL-13- and IL-4-dependent TF-1 proliferation. It also inhibited IL-13-induced STAT-6 (signal transduction and activator of transducer-6) activation in immune cells and cancer cells and reversed IL-13-induced inhibition of CD14 expression on human primary monocytes. These results demonstrate that high affinity binding and signal generation can be uncoupled efficiently in a ligand receptor interaction. These results also suggest that IL-13E13K may be a useful antagonist for the treatment of allergic, inflammatory, and parasitic diseases or even malignancies in which IL-13 plays a central role.',\n",

Here, we report that TFPI inhibits the proliferation of basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated endothelial cells. A truncated form of TFPI, containing only the first two Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor domains, has very little antiproliferative activity, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal region of TFPI is responsible for this activity. Binding studies revealed that full-length TFPI, but not the truncated TFPI molecule, is recognized by the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL receptor) indicating that this receptor is a novel high affinity endothelial cell receptor for TFPI. The antiproliferative activity of TFPI on endothelial cells is inhibited by the receptor-associated protein, a known antagonist of ligand binding by the VLDL receptor, and by anti-VLDL receptor antibodies. These results confirm that the antiproliferative activity of TFPI is mediated by the VLDL receptor and suggest that this receptor-ligand system may be a useful target for the development of new anti-angiogenic and antitumor agents.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a secreted growth factor that induces neurite outgrowth and is mitogenic for fibroblasts, epithelial, and endothelial cells. During tumor growth PTN can serve as an angiogenic factor and drive tumor invasion and metastasis. To identify a receptor for PTN, we panned a phage display human cDNA library against immobilized PTN protein as a bait. From this we isolated a phage insert that was homologous to an amino acid sequence stretch in the extracellular domain (ECD) of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In parallel with PTN, ALK is highly expressed during perinatal development of the nervous system and down-modulated in the adult. Here we show in cell-free assays as well as in radioligand receptor binding studies in intact cells that PTN binds to the ALK ECD with an apparent Kd of 32 +/- 9 pm. This receptor binding is inhibited by an excess of PTN, by the ALK ECD, and by anti-PTN and anti-ECD antibodies. PTN added to ALK-expressing cells induces phosphorylation of both ALK and of the downstream effector molecules IRS-1, Shc, phospholipase C-gamma, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Furthermore, the growth stimulatory effect of PTN on different cell lines in culture coincides with the endogenous expression of ALK mRNA, and the effect of PTN is enhanced by ALK overexpression. From this we conclude that ALK is a receptor that transduces PTN-mediated signals and propose that the PTN-ALK axis can play a significant role during development and during disease processes.',\n",

It acts as a carrier for steroid hormones and polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites. Previously, the existence of receptors for uptake of CCSP.ligand complexes into the renal proximal tubules had been suggested. Using surface plasmon resonance analysis, we demonstrate that CCSP binds to cubilin, a peripheral membrane protein on the surface of proximal tubular cells. Binding to cubilin results in uptake and lysosomal degradation of CCSP in cultured cells. Surprisingly, internalization of CCSP is blocked not only by cubilin antagonists but also by antibodies directed against megalin, an endocytic receptor that does not bind CCSP but associates with cubilin. Consistent with a role of both receptors in renal uptake of CCSP in vivo, patients deficient for cubilin or mice lacking megalin exhibit a defect in tubular uptake of the protein and excrete CCSP into the urine. These findings identify a cellular pathway consisting of a CCSP-binding protein (cubilin) and an endocytic coreceptor (megalin) responsible for tissue-specific uptake of CCSP and associated ligands.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The integrin alpha(7)beta(1) is the major laminin-binding integrin in skeletal, heart, and smooth muscle and is a receptor for laminin-1 and -2. It mediates myoblast migration on laminin-1 and -2 and thus might be involved in muscle development and repair. Previously we have shown that alpha(7)B as well as the alpha(7)A and -C splice variants induce cell motility on laminin when transfected into nonmotile HEK293 cells. In this study we have investigated the role of the cytoplasmic domain of alpha(7) in the laminin-induced signal transduction of alpha(7)beta(1) integrin regulating cell adhesion and migration. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain did not affect assembly of the mutated alpha(7)Deltacyt/beta(1) heterodimer on the cell surface or adhesion of alpha(7)Deltacyt-transfected cells to laminin. The motility of these cells on the laminin-1/E8 fragment, however, was significantly reduced to the level of mock-transfected cells; lamellipodia formation and polarization of the cells were also impaired. Adhesion to the laminin-1/E8 fragment induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and p130(CAS) as well as the formation of a p130(CAS)-Crk complex in wild-type alpha(7)B-transfected cells. In alpha(7)BDeltacyt cells, however, the extent of p130(CAS) tyrosine formation was reduced and formation of the p130(CAS)-Crk complex was impaired, with unaltered levels of p130(CAS) and Crk protein levels. These findings indicate adhesion-dependent regulation of p130(CAS)/Crk complex formation by the cytoplasmic domain of alpha(7)B integrin after cell adhesion to laminin-1/E8 and imply alpha(7)B-controlled lamellipodia formation and cell migration through the p130(CAS)/Crk protein complex.',\n",

The activity of this family of proteinases is carefully regulated at the level of zymogen activation and by a family of specific inhibitors termed tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP). It is now becoming clear that levels of certain MMPs are modulated by their association with cellular receptors that mediate their rapid internalization and degradation. In the current investigation we report that the amount of MMP-9 in conditioned cell culture medium is significantly increased when mouse embryonic fibroblasts are grown in the presence of the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist of ligand binding to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). In vitro assays reveal that the MMP-9.TIMP-1 complex binds to LRP with high affinity and that the binding determinant for LRP appears to reside on MMP-9. Cell lines expressing LRP mediate the internalization of 125I-labeled MMP-9.TIMP-1 complexes, whereas cell lines genetically deficient in LRP show a diminished capacity to mediate the cellular catabolism of MMP-9.TIMP-1 complexes. The results demonstrate that LRP is a functional receptor for MMP-9 and suggest a major role for LRP in modulating remodeling of the extracellular matrix by regulating extracellular proteinase activity.',\n",

To understand the molecular mechanism of integrin inside-out signaling, we generated K562 stable cell lines that expressed LFA-1 (alpha(L)beta(2)) or Mac-1 (alpha(M)beta(2)) with mutations in the cytoplasmic domain. Complete truncation of the beta(2) cytoplasmic domain, but not a truncation that retained the membrane proximal eight residues, resulted in constitutive activation of alpha(L)beta(2) and alpha(M)beta(2), demonstrating the importance of this membrane proximal region in the regulation of integrin adhesive function. Furthermore, replacement of the alpha(L) and beta(2) cytoplasmic domains with acidic and basic peptides that form an alpha-helical coiled coil caused inactivation of alpha(L)beta(2). Association of these artificial cytoplasmic domains was directly demonstrated. By contrast, replacement of the alpha(L) and beta(2) cytoplasmic domains with two basic peptides that do not form an alpha-helical coiled coil activated alpha(L)beta(2). Induction of ligand binding by the activating cytoplasmic domain mutations correlated with the induction of activation epitopes in the extracellular domain.

       "  'Abstract': 'Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, which regulate the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. Here we show that among members of the BMP family, BMP-4 and growth/differentiation factor 5 (GDF-5) induce osteoblast differentiation through the activation of three receptor-regulated Smads (i.e. Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8). By contrast, BMP-6 and BMP-7 induce alkaline phosphatase activity through Smad1 and Smad5, but not through Smad8. Consistent with these findings, BMP-4 induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8, but BMP-6 activated only Smad1 and Smad5. BMP-4 and GDF-5 are known to bind to activin receptor-like kinase 3 (ALK-3) and/or ALK-6 (also termed BMP type IA and type IB receptors, respectively), whereas BMP-6 and BMP-7 preferentially bind to ALK-2. Compared with the effects induced by only one of the type I receptors, the combination of constitutively active forms of ALK-2 and ALK-3 (or ALK-6) more strongly induced alkaline phosphatase activity in C2C12 cells. Moreover, addition of BMP-4 and BMP-6 to C2C12 cells resulted in higher alkaline phosphatase activity than that of only one of these BMPs. The combination of ALK-2 and ALK-3 also induced higher transcriptional activity than either receptor alone. Thus, ALK-2 and ALK-3 (or ALK-6) might synergistically induce osteoblast differentiation of C2C12 cells, possibly through efficient activation of downstream signaling pathways.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is involved in the survival of a number of different neural cell types, including motor neurons. CNTF functional responses are mediated through a tripartite membrane receptor composed of two signalling receptor chains, gp130 and the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), associated with a non-signalling CNTF binding receptor alpha component (CNTFR). CNTFR-deficient mice show profound neuronal deficits at birth, leading to a lethal phenotype. In contrast, inactivation of the CNTF gene leads only to a slight muscle weakness, mainly during adulthood, suggesting that CNTFR binds to a second ligand that is important for development. Modelling studies of the interleukin-6 family member cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) revealed structural similarities with CNTF, including the conservation of a site I domain involved in binding to CNTFR. Co-expression of CLC and CNTFR in mammalian cells generates a secreted composite cytokine, displaying activities on cells expressing the gp130-LIFR complex on their surface. Correspondingly, CLC-CNTFR activates gp130, LIFR and STAT3 signalling components, and enhances motor neuron survival. Together, these observations demonstrate that CNTFR induces the secretion of CLC, as well as mediating the functional responses of CLC.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have previously shown that chronic alcohol consumption inhibits liver regeneration by impairing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-operated phospholipase C-(gamma1) (PLC-(gamma1)) activation and the resultant rise in intracellular [Ca(2+)](i). In hepatocytes, activation of PLC-(gamma1) by EGFR requires involvement of a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G(alphai)) as an intermediate. In the present study, we first identified the G(alphai) protein isoform associated with the activated EGFR, and then examined whether the toxic effect of alcohol on EGFR signaling and liver cell proliferation was exerted on this association. In cultured hepatocytes from control rats, EGF rapidly induced association between EGFR and G(alphai2) but not other G(alphai) isoforms. In hepatocytes from rats fed alcohol for 16 weeks, EGF failed to stimulate this association of G(alphai2) with the EGFR. The impairment of EGFR-G(alphai2) complex formation caused by alcohol was associated with a decreased level of G(alphai2) in the plasma membrane fraction (approximately 50% control). Pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of G(alphai) function, produced an analogous disruption of the association between G(alphai2) and the EGFR, as well as inhibiting EGF-induced DNA synthesis. It is concluded that, in hepatocytes, G(alphai2) is specific among G(alphai) isoforms in coupling activation of the EGFR to other signaling pathways that control cell proliferation. Impaired coupling of G(alphai2) of EGFR could contribute to the mechanism by which chronic alcohol exposure inhibits liver regeneration.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CYR61, an angiogenic factor and a member of the CCN protein family, is an extracellular matrix-associated, heparin-binding protein that mediates cell adhesion, promotes cell migration, and enhances growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation. CYR61 induces angiogenesis and promotes tumor growth in vivo and is expressed in dermal fibroblasts during cutaneous wound healing. It has been demonstrated recently that adhesion of primary skin fibroblasts to CYR61 is mediated through integrin alpha(6)beta(1) and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, resulting in adhesive signaling and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3. CYR61 is composed of four discrete structural domains that bear sequence similarities to the insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, von Willebrand factor type C repeat, thrombospondin type 1 repeat, and a carboxyl-terminal (CT) domain that resembles cysteine knots found in some growth factors. In this study, we show that a CYR61 mutant (CYR61DeltaCT) that has the CT domain deleted is unable to support adhesion of primary human skin fibroblasts but is still able to stimulate chemotaxis and enhance basic fibroblast growth factor-induced mitogenesis similar to wild type. In addition, fibroblast migration to CYR61 is mediated through integrin alpha(v)beta(5) but not integrins alpha(6)beta(1) or alpha(v)beta(3). Furthermore, we show that CYR61 binds directly to purified integrin alpha(v)beta(5) in vitro. By contrast, CYR61 enhancement of basic fibroblast growth factor-induced DNA synthesis is mediated through integrin alpha(v)beta(3), a known receptor for CYR61 that mediates CYR61-dependent cell adhesion and chemotaxis in vascular endothelial cells. Thus, CYR61 promotes primary human fibroblast adhesion, migration, and mitogenesis through integrins alpha(6)beta(1), alpha(v)beta(5), and alpha(v)beta(3), respectively. Together, these findings establish CYR61 as a novel ligand for integrin alpha(v)beta(5) and show that CYR61 interacts with distinct integrins to mediate disparate activities in a cell type-specific manner.',\n",

Apart from its specific function in stabilizing the lipid film of human tear fluid, it is suggested to act as a physiological scavenger of potentially harmful lipophilic compounds, in general. To characterize proteins involved in the reception, detoxification, or degradation of these ligands, a cDNA phage-display library from human pituitary gland was constructed and screened for proteins interacting with Lcn-1. Using this method an Lcn-1 interacting phage was isolated that expressed a novel human protein. Molecular cloning and analysis of the entire cDNA indicated that it encodes a 55-kDa protein, lipocalin-1 interacting membrane receptor (LIMR), with nine putative transmembrane domains. The cell membrane location of this protein was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis of membrane fractions of human NT2 cells. Independent biochemical investigations using a recombinant N-terminal fragment of LIMR also demonstrated a specific interaction with Lcn-1 in vitro. Based on these data, we suggest LIMR to be a receptor of Lcn-1 ligands. These findings constitute the first report of cloning of a lipocalin interacting, plasma membrane-located receptor, in general. In addition, a sequence comparison supports the biological relevance of this novel membrane protein, because genes with significant nucleotide sequence similarity are present in Takifugu rubripes, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Bos taurus, and Sus scrofa. According to data derived from the human genome sequencing project, the LIMR-encoding gene has to be mapped on human chromosome 12, and its intron/exon organization could be established. The entire LIMR-encoding gene consists of about 13.7 kilobases in length and contains 16 introns with a length between 91 and 3438 base pairs.',\n",

CXCL16 is an alpha (CXC) chemokine but also has characteristics of CC chemokines and a structure similar to fractalkine (neurotactin) in having a transmembrane region and a chemokine domain suspended by a mucin-like stalk. A recombinant version of CXCL16 fails to mediate chemotaxis to all known chemokine receptor transfectants tested but does mediate robust chemotaxis, high affinity binding, and calcium mobilization to Bonzo receptor transfectants, indicating that this is a unique receptor ligand interaction. In vitro polarized T cell subsets including Th1, Th2, and Tr1 cells express functional Bonzo, suggesting expression of this receptor in chronic inflammation, which we further verified by demonstration of CXCL16-mediated migration of tonsil-derived CD4(+) T lymphocytes. CXCL16 is expressed on the surface of APCs including subsets of CD19(+) B cells and CD14(+) monocyte/macrophages, and functional CXCL16 is also shed from macrophages. The combination of unique structural features of both Bonzo and CXCL16 suggest that this interaction may represent a new class of ligands for this receptor family.

Its receptor complex consists of a ligand-binding component, CNTF receptor (CNTFR), associated with two signaling receptor components, gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Striking phenotypic differences between CNTF- and CNTFR-deficient mice suggest that CNTFR serves as a receptor for a second developmentally important ligand. We recently demonstrated that cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) associates with the soluble orphan receptor cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF) to form a heterodimeric cytokine that displayed activities only on cells expressing the tripartite CNTF receptor on their surface. In this present study we examined the membrane binding of the CLC/CLF composite cytokine and observed a preferential interaction of the cytokine with the CNTFR subunit. Signaling pathways recruited by the CLC/CLF complex in human neuroblastoma cell lines were also analyzed in detail. The results obtained showed an activation of Janus kinases (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2) leading to a tyrosine phosphorylation of the gp130 and LIFR. The phosphorylated signaling receptors served in turn as docking proteins for signal transducing molecules such as STAT3 and SHP-2. In vitro analysis revealed that the gp130-LIFR pathway could also stimulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In contrast to that reported before for CNTF, soluble CNTFR failed to promote the action CLC/CLF, and an absolute requirement of the membrane form of CNTFR was required to generate a functional response to the composite cytokine. This study reinforces the functional similarity between CNTF and the CLC/CLF composite cytokine defining the second ligand for CNTFR.',\n",

We show that the truncation conditions the Vps10p domain for propeptide inhibitable binding of neuropeptides and the receptor-associated protein. We further demonstrate that avid binding of the receptor-associated protein, apolipoprotein E, and lipoprotein lipase not inhibited by propeptide occurs to sites located in other lumenal domains. In transfected cells, about 10% of full-length sorLA were expressed on the cell surface capable of mediating endocytosis. However, the major pool of receptors was found in late Golgi compartments, suggesting possible interaction with newly synthesized ligands.

PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF alpha and beta receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-alpha homodimers and PDGF receptor-alpha/beta heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types. Analysis of PDGF-CC in vivo in a diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing showed that PDGF-CC significantly enhanced repair of a full-thickness skin excision. Together, these studies describe a third member of the PDGF family (PDGF-C) as a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin in in vitro and in vivo systems with a binding pattern similar to PDGF-AB.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The interaction of the C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin, CCK-8, with the third extracellular loop of human cholecystokinin-A receptor, CCK(A)-R(329-357), has been probed by high-resolution NMR and extensive computer simulations. The structure of CCK(A)-R(329-357) in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles consists of three alpha-helices, with the first and third corresponding to the extracellular ends of transmembrane (TM) helices 6 and 7. The central helix, residues W335-R345, is found to lie on the zwitterionic surface. Titration with CCK-8 produces a stable complex with a number of intermolecular NOEs between the C-terminus of the ligand (Trp(30), Met(31), Asp(32)) and the interface of TM6 and the third extracellular loop (N333, A334, Y338) of the receptor fragment. The mode of ligand binding based on these intermolecular NOEs is in agreement with a number of published findings from receptor mutagenesis and photoaffinity cross-linking. Utilizing these ligand/receptor points of interaction, the structural features of CCK(A)-R(329-357), and also the structures of CCK-8 and CCK(A)-R(1-47) previously determined, extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the CCK-8/CCK(A)-R complex were carried out. The results provide unique insight into the molecular interactions and forces important for the binding of CCK-8 to CCK(A)-R.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) is an X-linked disorder characterized by abnormal development of ectoderm and its appendices. The EDA gene encodes different isoforms of ectodysplasin, a transmembrane protein. The two longest isoforms, ectodysplasin-A1 and -A2, which differ by an insertion of two amino acids, are trimeric type II membrane proteins with an extracellular portion containing a short collagenous domain and a TNF ligand motif in the C-terminal region. We show that ectodysplasin is released from cells to the culture medium. Deletion constructs were used to localize the cleavage site and show that the putative recognition sequence of a furin-like enzyme is needed for the cleavage. Some EDA patients have missense mutations affecting this recognition sequence, suggesting that cleavage has biological significance in vivo. EDAR, a recently cloned member of the TNFR family and the product of the downless gene, is able to co-precipitate ectodysplasin, confirming that they form a ligand-receptor pair. In situ hybridization and immunostaining studies show that ectodysplasin and EDAR are expressed in adjacent or partially overlapping layers in the developing human skin. We conclude that as a soluble ligand, ectodysplasin is able to interact with EDAR and mediate signals needed for the development of ectodermal appendages.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The extracellular domain of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta (RPTPbeta) is composed of several domains which mediate its interactions with distinct ligands present on the surface of either neurons or glial cells. Here, we demonstrate that the fibronectin type III domain (FNIII) of RPTPbeta binds to glial tumor-derived cell lines and primary astrocytes. We used affinity purification to isolate several proteins that specifically bind to the FNIII domain of RPTPbeta. One of these, a 240 kDa protein that was purified from U118MG glioblastoma cell, was identified as tenascin C based on the amino acid sequence of several tryptic peptides. The interaction of RPTPbeta with tenascin C was found to mediate cell adhesion. Adhesion and spreading of SF763T astrocytoma cells expressing RPTPbeta on tenascin C was specifically abolished by the addition of a soluble fragment containing the FNIII domain of the receptor. RPTPbeta-dependent cell adhesion was mediated by binding to the alternatively spliced FNIII repeats A1,2,4 (TnfnA1,2,4) of tenascin C. Furthermore, COS cells expressing RPTPbeta adhere to TnfnA1,2,4, while the parental cells did not. These results demonstrate that the FNIII domain of RPTPbeta binds to tenascin C and suggest that RPTPbeta present on glial tumor cells is a primary adhesion receptor system to the extracellular matrix.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Ghrelin has been proposed as a natural ligand of the GH secretagogue receptor(s) (GHS-R), which was an orphan receptor activated by synthetic peptidyl (hexarelin) and non-peptidyl (MK-0677) GHS to strongly release GH in animals and humans. Herein we studied: 1) the binding of 125I-labeled human ghrelin to membranes from human hypothalamus and pituitary gland; 2) the ability of human ghrelin (either octanoylated or desoctanoylated), as well as of some GHS and neuropeptides to compete with the radioligand. The saturation binding analysis showed, in both tissues, the existence of a single class of high-affinity binding sites with limited binding capacity. The Bmax (maximal number of binding sites) values of ghrelin receptors in the hypothalamus were significantly greater (p<0.001) than those detected in the pituitary, whereas the Kd (dissociation constant) values in the two tissues were similar. 125I-ghrelin bound to hypothalamic membranes was displaced by ghrelin, hexarelin, MK-0677, various GHS antagonists (EP-80317, [D-Arg1-D-Phe5-D-Trp7,9-Leu11]-substance P) and some natural (cortistatin-14) and synthetic (vapreotide) SRIH-14 agonists. In contrast, no competition was seen in the presence of GHRH-44, SRIH-14 or desoctanoylated ghrelin, a ghrelin precursor that is devoid of GH-releasing properties. In conclusion, this preliminary study firstly demonstrates that ghrelin needs octanoylation to bind its hypothalamo-pituitary receptors. These receptors are the specific binding sites for GHS and their antagonists, as well as for SRIH analogs (vapreotide and cortistatin- 14), but not for native SRIH.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Amyloid-beta, the pathologic protein in Alzheimer's disease, induces chemotaxis and production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytic cells, but mechanisms have not been fully defined. Here we provide three lines of evidence that the phagocyte G protein-coupled receptor (N-formylpeptide receptor 2 (FPR2)) mediates these amyloid-beta-dependent functions in phagocytic cells. First, transfection of FPR2, but not related receptors, including the other known N-formylpeptide receptor FPR, reconstituted amyloid-beta-dependent chemotaxis and calcium flux in HEK 293 cells. Second, amyloid-beta induced both calcium flux and chemotaxis in mouse neutrophils (which express endogenous FPR2) with similar potency as in FPR2-transfected HEK 293 cells. This activity could be specifically desensitized in both cell types by preincubation with a specific FPR2 agonist, which desensitizes the receptor, or with pertussis toxin, which uncouples it from G(i)-dependent signaling. Third, specific and reciprocal desensitization of superoxide production was observed when N-formylpeptides and amyloid-beta were used to sequentially stimulate neutrophils from FPR -/- mice, which express FPR2 normally. Potential biological relevance of these results to the neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease was suggested by two additional findings: first, FPR2 mRNA could be detected by PCR in mouse brain; second, induction of FPR2 expression correlated with induction of calcium flux and chemotaxis by amyloid-beta in the mouse microglial cell line N9. Further, in sequential stimulation experiments with N9 cells, N-formylpeptides and amyloid-beta were able to reciprocally cross-desensitize each other. Amyloid-beta was also a specific agonist at the human counterpart of FPR2, the FPR-like 1 receptor. These results suggest a unified signaling mechanism for linking amyloid-beta to phagocyte chemotaxis and oxidant stress in the brain.\",\n",

A dimeric aggregate of KIR-HLA-C complexes was observed in one KIR2DL1-HLA-Cw4 crystal.

NPY Y(1) antagonist BIBP3226 and mixed Y(1) antagonist/Y(4) agonist GR231118 are able to displace with low affinity, 50 -- 100 nM, the specific binding on NPFF receptors expressed in CHO cells as well as in rat dorsal spinal cord, an affinity however superior to those determined against Y(2), Y(4) or Y(5) receptors. Furthermore, BIBP3226 which is unable to inhibit the forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production mediated by NPFF(2) receptors, antagonizes the effect of NPFF, revealing the first antagonist of NPFF receptors.

Here we demonstrate that anti-alpha3 integrin antibody induced a transient enhanced interaction of calreticulin with alpha3 integrin. Transfection of antisense oligonucleotides of calreticulin in RD cells abrogated the interaction between calreticulin and alpha3 integrin, and completely suppressed activation of MMP-2 and enhanced secretion of proMMP-2 induced by anti-alpha3 integrin antibody.

       "  'Abstract': 'Removal of cholesterol-containing particles from the circulation is mediated by the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. Upon ligand binding, the receptor-ligand complex is endocytosed, and the ligand is released. The important biological role of the LDL receptor (LDLR) has been highlighted by the identification of more than 400 LDLR mutations that are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia. The extracellular region of the LDLR is modular in nature and principally comprises multiple copies of ligand binding, epidermal growth factor-like (EGF), and YWTD-type domains. This report describes characterization of the calcium binding properties of the tandem pair of EGF domains. While only the C-terminal EGF module contains the consensus sequence associated with calcium binding, a noncanonical calcium binding site in the N-terminal domain has been revealed using solution NMR spectroscopy. The calcium dissociation constants for the N- and C-terminal sites have been measured under physiologically relevant pH and ionic strength conditions using a combination of solution NMR, intrinsic protein fluorescence, and chromophoric chelator methods to be approximately 50 microM and approximately 10-20 microM, respectively. Identification of the novel calcium binding motif in LDLR sequences from other species suggests that it may confer specificity within the LDLR gene family. Comparison of the K(d) for the C-terminal site with the calcium concentration in late vesicles indicates that the binding properties of this module may be tuned to titrate upon endocytosis of the LDL receptor-ligand complex, and thus calcium binding may play a role in the ligand dissociation process.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Adaptive stress responses mediated by the endocrine, autonomic, cardiovascular and immune systems are essential for the survival of the individual. Initial stress-induced responses provide a vital short-term metabolic lift, but prolonged or inappropriate exposure to stress can compromise homeostasis thereby leading to disease. This 'fight-or-flight' response is characterized by the activation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-adrenocorticotropin-glucocorticoid axis, mediated by the type 1 CRH receptor. In contrast, the type 2 CRH receptor mediates the stress-coping responses during the recovery phase of stress. We identified human stresscopin (SCP) and stresscopin-related peptide (SRP) as specific ligands for the type 2 CRH receptor. The genes encoding these peptides were expressed in diverse peripheral tissues as well as in the central nervous system. Treatment with SCP or SRP suppressed food intake, delayed gastric emptying and decreased heat-induced edema. Thus SCP and SRP might represent endogenous ligands for maintaining homeostasis after stress, and could allow the design of drugs to ameliorate stress-related diseases.\",\n",

Integrins, via interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM), control cell adhesion and motility. The two systems are functionally linked because uPAR and PAI-1 bind to the ECM component vitronectin (VN). Because integrin signaling alters gene expression patterns, we investigated whether the expression levels of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 are affected by ECM/integrin interactions. Expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 was significantly enhanced when human ovarian cancer cells (OV-MZ-6) were cultivated on fibronectin or collagen type IV. In contrast, VN induced down-regulation of uPA and uPAR while increasing PAI-1 by up to 4-fold. VN-dependent decrease of uPA protein was paralleled by a significant reduction of uPA promoter activity that was even more pronounced upon alpha(v)beta(3) overexpression and depended on the presence of intact Rel protein-binding sites. The activity of Rel transcription factors was also significantly reduced upon alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated cell adhesion to VN. The activity of the Rel-unresponsive PAI-1 promoter was up to 5-fold induced as a function of alpha(v)beta(3)/VN interaction. Thus, the balance between available concentrations of uPA, uPAR, PAI-1, and integrins in human ovarian cancer cells might provide a switch within the regulation of their invasive phenotype.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have reported previously that human alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP) inhibits the infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) by R5 HIV-1, and that a disulphide-bridged peptide mimicking the clade B HIV-1 gp120 consensus V3 domain (V3Cs) binds specifically to CCR5 (the major co-receptor of R5 HIV strains) on these cells [Seddiki, Rabehi, Benjouad, Saffar, Ferriere, Gluckman and Gattegno (1997) Glycobiology 7, 1229-1236]. The present study demonstrates that AGP binds specifically to MDM at high- and low-affinity binding sites with K(d) values of 16 nM and 4.9 microM respectively. The fact that heat denaturation of AGP only partly inhibited this binding (43%) suggests that protein-protein interactions are involved, as well as AGP glycans which are resistant to heat denaturation. Mannan, but not dextran, is a significant inhibitor (52%) of this binding, and sequential exoglycosidase treatment of AGP, which exposes penultimate mannose residues, has a strong stimulatory effect ( approximately 2.8-fold). Therefore AGP glycans (probably mannose residues) are involved, at least partly, in the binding of AGP to MDM. In addition, AGP inhibits the binding of V3Cs and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta) to MDM. The anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody 2D7, specific for the second extracellular loop of CCR5, also inhibited AGP binding (67%), whereas anti-CCR5 antibodies specific for the C-terminus of CCR5 region had no effect. Native AGP, like V3Cs (but not heat-denatured AGP), binds to 46 and 33-36 kDa electroblotted AGP-bound MDM membrane ligands, characterized as CCR5 by their interactions with anti-CCR5 antibodies and with MIP-1beta. Therefore both AGP glycans and MDM CCR5 are involved in the binding of AGP to MDM. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of AGP on the infection of human primary macrophages by R5 HIV-1 may be related to specific binding of AGP to a macrophage membrane lectin or lectin-like component and to CCR5.',\n",

To study ligand/receptor interactions, we used a novel photosensitive radioiodinated antagonist of the human oxytocin receptor, d(CH(2))(5) [Tyr(Me)(2),Thr(4),Orn(8),Phe(3(125)I,4N(3))-NH(2)9]vasotocin. This ligand had an equivalent high affinity for human oxytocin and V(1a) vasopressin receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Taking advantage of this dual specificity, we conducted photoaffinity labeling experiments on both receptors. Photolabeled oxytocin and V(1a) receptors appeared as a unique protein band at 70-75 kDa and two labeled protein bands at 85-90 and 46 kDa, respectively. To identify contact sites between the antagonist and the receptors, the labeled 70-75- and the 46-kDa proteins were cleaved with CNBr and digested with Lys-C and Arg-C endoproteinases. The fragmentation patterns allowed the identification of a covalently labeled region in the oxytocin receptor transmembrane domain III consisting of the residues Leu(114)-Val(115)-Lys(116). Analysis of contact sites in the V(1a) receptor led to the identification of the homologous region consisting of the residues Val(126)-Val(127)-Lys(128). Binding domains were confirmed by mutation of several CNBr cleavage sites in the oxytocin receptor and of one Lys-C cleavage site in the V(1a) receptor.

       "  'Abstract': 'Lymphocyte homing to secondary lymphoid tissue is defined by a multistep sequence of interactions between lymphocytes and endothelial cells in high endothelial venules (HEVs). After initial selectin-mediated tethering and rolling, firm adhesion of lymphocytes requires rapid upregulation of lymphocyte integrin adhesiveness. This step is mediated in part by the HEV-derived chemokine SLC (secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine, or CCL21) that binds to the CC chemokine receptor (CCR)7 on lymphocytes. However, the CC chemokine ELC (Epstein-Barr virus-induced molecule 1 ligand chemokine, or CCL19) shares the same receptor, and ELC transcripts have been observed in the T cell areas of lymphoid organs. Here, we show that perivascular ELC is transcytosed to the luminal surfaces of HEVs and enables efficient T cell homing to lymph nodes. In situ hybridization on sections of human tonsil showed no ELC mRNA in HEVs, but immunostaining revealed ELC protein in cytoplasmic vesicles of HEV cells. Furthermore, ELC injected into the footpads of mice entered the draining lymph nodes and was presented by HEVs. Finally, intracutaneous injections of ELC in mice lacking functionally relevant ELC and SLC (plt/plt mice) restored T cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes as efficiently as SLC. We conclude that perivascular ELC is transcytosed to the luminal surfaces of HEVs and participates in CCR7-mediated triggering of lymphocyte arrest.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The anaphylatoxin C3a is a potent chemotactic peptide and inflammatory mediator released during complement activation which binds to and activates a G-protein-coupled receptor. Molecular cloning of the C3aR has facilitated studies to identify nonpeptide antagonists of the C3aR. A chemical lead that selectively inhibited the C3aR in a high throughput screen was identified and chemically optimized. The resulting antagonist, N(2)-[(2,2-diphenylethoxy)acetyl]-L-arginine (SB 290157), functioned as a competitive antagonist of (125)I-C3a radioligand binding to rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells expressing the human C3aR (RBL-C3aR), with an IC(50) of 200 nM. SB 290157 was a functional antagonist, blocking C3a-induced C3aR internalization in a concentration-dependent manner and C3a-induced Ca(2+) mobilization in RBL-C3aR cells and human neutrophils with IC(50)s of 27.7 and 28 nM, respectively. SB 290157 was selective for the C3aR in that it did not antagonize the C5aR or six other chemotactic G protein-coupled receptors. Functional antagonism was not solely limited to the human C3aR; SB 290157 also inhibited C3a-induced Ca(2+) mobilization of RBL-2H3 cells expressing the mouse and guinea pig C3aRS: It potently inhibited C3a-mediated ATP release from guinea pig platelets and inhibited C3a-induced potentiation of the contractile response to field stimulation of perfused rat caudal artery. Furthermore, in animal models, SB 290157, inhibited neutrophil recruitment in a guinea pig LPS-induced airway neutrophilia model and decreased paw edema in a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model. This selective antagonist may be useful to define the physiological and pathophysiological roles of the C3aR.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Three mammalian fringe proteins are implicated in controlling Notch activation by Delta/Serrate/Lag2 ligands during tissue boundary formation. It was proved recently that they are glycosyltransferases that initiate elongation of O-linked fucose residues attached to epidermal growth factor-like sequence repeats in the extracellular domain of Notch molecules. Here we demonstrate the existence of functional diversity among the mammalian fringe proteins. Although both manic fringe (mFng) and lunatic fringe (lFng) decreased the binding of Jagged1 to Notch2 and not that of Delta1, the decrease by mFng was greater in degree than that by lFng. We also found that both fringe proteins reduced Jagged1-triggered Notch2 signaling, whereas neither affected Delta1-triggered Notch2 signaling. However, the decrease in Jagged1-triggered Notch2 signaling by mFng was again greater than that by lFng. Furthermore, we observed that each fringe protein acted on a different site of the extracellular region of Notch2. Taking these findings together, we propose that the difference in modulatory function of multiple fringe proteins may result from the distinct amino acid sequence specificity targeted by these glycosyltransferases.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The integrin alphaLbeta2 has three different domains in its headpiece that have been suggested to either bind ligand or to regulate ligand binding. One of these, the inserted or I domain, has a fold similar to that of small G proteins. The I domain of the alphaM and alpha2 subunits has been crystallized in both open and closed conformations; however, the alphaL I domain has been crystallized in only the closed conformation. We hypothesized that the alphaL domain also would have an open conformation, and that this would be the ligand binding conformation. Therefore, we introduced pairs of cysteine residues to form disulfides that would lock the alphaL I domain in either the open or closed conformation. Locking the I domain open resulted in a 9,000-fold increase in affinity to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which was reversed by disulfide reduction. By contrast, the affinity of the locked closed conformer was similar to wild type. Binding completely depended on Mg(2+). Orders of affinity were ICAM-1 > ICAM-2 > ICAM-3. The k(on), k(off), and K(D) values for the locked open I domain were within 1.5-fold of values previously determined for the alphaLbeta2 complex, showing that the I domain is sufficient for full affinity binding to ICAM-1. The locked open I domain antagonized alphaLbeta2-dependent adhesion in vitro, lymphocyte homing in vivo, and firm adhesion but not rolling on high endothelial venules. The ability to reversibly lock a protein fold in an active conformation with dramatically increased affinity opens vistas in therapeutics and proteomics.',\n",

Distinct prolactin receptor isoforms, having different cytoplasmic domains generated by alternative splicing, are expressed as development proceeds at different levels in different organs. The \"long\" receptors are able to mediate transduction of all signals examined, in contrast with the \"short\" isoforms, whose truncated cytoplasmic domains are able to mediate a much smaller repertoire of signals and can act as dominant negatives. Our studies demonstrate that, although these forms share internalization mechanisms, the long form is internalized faster, resulting in more rapid down-regulation of this form. In order to examine the mechanisms by which prolactin may exert trophic effects on its target tissues during development, we have examined the signalling pathways through which prolactin binding to the long receptor regulates the transcription of cyclin D1.

       "  'Abstract': 'Proteinase-activated receptors are a recently described, novel family of seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors. Rather then being stimulated through ligand receptor occupancy, activation is initiated by cleavage of the N terminus of the receptor by a serine protease resulting in the generation of a new tethered ligand that interacts with the receptor within extracellular loop-2. To date, four proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) have been identified, with distinct N-terminal cleavage sites and tethered ligand pharmacology. In addition to the progress in the generation of PAR-1 antagonists, we describe the role of thrombin in such processes as wound healing and the evidence implicating PAR-1 in vascular disorders and cancer. We also identify advances in the understanding of PAR-1-mediated intracellular signaling and receptor desensitization. The cellular functions, signaling events, and desensitization processes involved in PAR-2 activation are also assessed. However, other major aspects of PAR-2 are highlighted, in particular the ability of several serine protease enzymes, in addition to trypsin, to function as activators of PAR-2. The likely physiological and pathophysiological roles for PAR-2 in skin, intestine, blood vessels, and the peripheral nervous system are considered in the context of PAR-2 activation by multiple serine proteases. The recent discovery of PAR-3 and PAR-4 as additional thrombin-sensitive PARs further highlights the complexity in assessing the effects of thrombin in several different systems, an issue that remains to be fully addressed. These discoveries have also highlighted possible PAR-PAR interactions at both functional and molecular levels. The future identification of other PARs and their modes of activation are an important future direction for this expanding field of study.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Wnt glycoproteins have been implicated in diverse processes during embryonic patterning in metazoa. They signal through frizzled-type seven-transmembrane-domain receptors to stabilize beta-catenin. Wnt signalling is antagonized by the extracellular Wnt inhibitor dickkopf1 (dkk1), which is a member of a multigene family. dkk1 was initially identified as a head inducer in Xenopus embryos but the mechanism by which it blocks Wnt signalling is unknown. LDL-receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is required during Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in Drosophila, Xenopus and mouse, possibly acting as a co-receptor for Wnt. Here we show that LRP6 (ref. 7) is a specific, high-affinity receptor for Dkk1 and Dkk2. Dkk1 blocks LRP6-mediated Wnt/beta-catenin signalling by interacting with domains that are distinct from those required for Wnt/Frizzled interaction. dkk1 and LRP6 interact antagonistically during embryonic head induction in Xenopus where LRP6 promotes the posteriorizing role of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Thus, DKKs inhibit Wnt co-receptor function, exemplifying the modulation of LRP signalling by antagonists.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Previous studies have established that ligation of keratinocyte alpha(2)beta(1) integrin by type I collagen induces expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and that MMP-1 activity is required for the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin-dependent migration of primary keratinocytes across collagenous matrices. We now present evidence that MMP-1 binds the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin via the I domain of the alpha(2) integrin subunit. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with purified human MMP-1 and recombinant alpha(2) integrin I domain, we showed that the alpha(2) integrin I domain specifically bound in a divalent cation-dependent manner to both the pro and active forms of MMP-1, but not to MMP-3 or MMP-13. Although both the I domain and MMP-1 bind divalent cations, MMP-1 bound, in a divalent cation-dependent manner, to alpha(2) integrin I domains containing metal ion-dependent adhesion sites motif mutations that prevent divalent cation binding to the I domain, demonstrating that the metal ion dependence is a function of MMP-1. Using a series of MMP-1-MMP-3 and MMP-1-MMP-13 chimeras, we determined that both the linker domain and the hemopexin-like domain of MMP-1 were required for optimal binding to the I domain. The alpha(2) integrin/MMP-1 interaction described here extends an emerging paradigm in matrix biology involving anchoring of proteinases to the cell surface to regulate their biological activities.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In injured skin, collagenase-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1)) is induced in migrating keratinocytes. This site-specific expression is regulated by binding of the alpha(2)beta(1) integrin with dermal type I collagen, and the catalytic activity of MMP-1 is required for keratinocyte migration. Because of this functional association among substrate/ligand, receptor, and proteinase, we assessed whether the integrin also directs the compartmentalization of MMP-1 to its matrix target. Indeed, pro-MMP-1 co-localized to sites of alpha(2)beta(1) contacts in migrating keratinocytes. Furthermore, pro-MMP-1 co-immunoprecipitated with alpha(2)beta(1) from keratinocytes, and alpha(2)beta(1) co-immunoprecipitated with pro-MMP-1. No other MMPs bound alpha(2)beta(1), and no other integrins interacted with MMP-1. Pro-MMP-1 also provided a substrate for alpha(2)beta(1)-dependent adhesion of platelets. Complex formation on keratinocytes was most efficient on native type I collagen and reduced or ablated on denatured or cleaved collagen. Competition studies suggested that the alpha(2) I domain interacts with the linker and hemopexin domains of pro-MMP-1, not with the pro-domain. These data indicate that the interaction of pro-MMP-1 with alpha(2)beta(1) confines this proteinase to points of cell contact with collagen and that the ternary complex of integrin, enzyme, and substrate function together to drive and regulate keratinocyte migration.',\n",

N6-Cyclopentyladenosine on uncapacitated spermatozoa did not induce spontaneous acrosome reaction after 5 h capacitation, whereas the number of capacitated spermatozoa, assessed by lysophosphatidylcholine-induced acrosome reaction with Pisum sativum agglutinin staining, was significantly increased. N6-Cyclopentyladenosine was also added to capacitated human spermatozoa to find out whether the agonist could induce the acrosome reaction. Results, although statistically significant, could not be considered biologically significant. A1-Mediated capacitation was followed by the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein subset ranging between M(r) = 200 000 and 30 000. Stimulation of A1 receptor with the selective agonist elicited an agonist-induced inositol phospholipid hydrolysis leading to a transient rise of inositol triphosphate (IP3). This increase was not induced by A(1) receptor antagonist and was blocked by phospholipase C inhibitor. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that the A(1) receptor is coupled to Galphai2 subunit suggesting that the activation of phospholipase C is mediated by betagamma subunits. In conclusion, the A(1) adenosine receptor in human spermatozoa is coupled to Galphai2, signals via IP3, and affects the capacitative status of ejaculated spermatozoa.',\n",

The alpha chains of laminins have been shown to have various biological activities. In this study, we identified a sequence of the alpha 3 chain C-terminal globular domain (LG1-LG5 modules) required for both heparin binding and cell adhesion using recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides. We found that the LG3 and LG4 modules have activity for heparin binding and that LG4 has activity for cell adhesion. Studies with synthetic peptides delineated the A3G75aR sequence (NSFMALYLSKGR, residues 1412--1423) within LG4 as a major site for both heparin and cell binding. Substitution mutations in LG4 and A3G75aR identified the Lys and Arg of the A3G75aR sequence as critical for these activities. Cell adhesion to LG4 and A3G75aR was inhibited by heparitinase I treatment of cells, suggesting that cell binding to the A3G75aR site was mediated by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. We showed by affinity chromatography that syndecan-2 from fibroblasts bound to LG4. Solid-phase assays confirmed that syndecan-2 interacted with the A3G75aR peptide sequence. Stably transfected 293T cells with expression vectors for syndecan-2 and -4, but not glypican-1, specifically adhered to LG4 and A3G75aR. These results indicate that the A3G75aR sequence within the laminin alpha 3 LG4 module is responsible for cell adhesion and suggest that syndecan-2 and -4 mediate this activity.',\n",

In conclusion, [125I]-S36057 is a more potent and more stable radioligand than [125I]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH that will represent a reliable tool for binding assays in the search of novel MCH ligands.

       "  'Abstract': 'We have demonstrated previously that the Slit proteins, which are involved in axonal guidance and related developmental processes in nervous tissue, are ligands of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1 in brain (Liang, Y., Annan, R. S., Carr, S. A., Popp, S., Mevissen, M., Margolis, R. K., and Margolis, R. U. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 17885--17892). To characterize these interactions in more detail, recombinant human Slit-2 protein and the N- and C-terminal portions generated by in vivo proteolytic processing were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the binding of a glypican-Fc fusion protein. Saturable and reversible high affinity binding to the full-length protein and to the C-terminal portion that is released from the cell membrane was seen, with dissociation constants in the 80-110 nm range, whereas only a relatively low level of binding to the larger N-terminal segment was detected. Co-transfection of 293 cells with Slit and glypican-1 cDNAs followed by immunoprecipitation demonstrated that these interactions also occur in vivo, and immunocytochemical studies showed colocalization in the embryonic and adult central nervous system. The binding affinity of the glypican core protein to Slit is an order of magnitude lower than that of the glycanated proteoglycan. Glypican binding to Slit was also decreased 80--90% by heparin (2 microg/ml), enzymatic removal of the heparan sulfate chains, and by chlorate inhibition of glypican sulfation. The differential effects of N- or O-desulfated heparin on glypican binding also indicate that O-sulfate groups on the heparan sulfate chains play a critical role in heparin interactions with Slit. Our data suggest that glypican binding to the releasable C-terminal portion of Slit may serve as a mechanism for regulating the biological activity of Slit and/or the proteoglycan.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Mature transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is proteolytically derived from the C terminus of a precursor protein. Latency-associated protein (LAP), the N-terminal remnant of the TGF-beta precursor, is able to bind and neutralize TGF-beta. Mature TGF-beta exerts its activity by binding and complexing members of two subfamilies of receptors, the type I and II receptors. In addition to these signaling receptors, TGF-beta can also interact with an accessory receptor termed the type III receptor. Using a surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor (BIAcore), we determined the mechanisms of interaction of four binding proteins (LAP, the type II and III receptor ectodomains (EDs), and a type II receptor ED/Fc chimera) with three TGF-beta isoforms, and we quantified their related kinetic parameters. Using global fitting based on a numerical integration data analysis method, we demonstrated that LAP and the type II receptor/Fc chimera interacted with the TGF-beta isoforms with a 1:1 stoichiometry. In contrast, the type II ED interactions with TGF-beta were best fit by a kinetic model assuming the presence of two independent binding sites on the ligand molecule. We also showed that the type III ED bound two TGF-beta molecules. Further experiments revealed that LAP was able to block the interactions of TGF-beta with the two EDs, but that the two EDs did not compete or cooperate with each other. Together, these results strongly support the existence of a cell-surface complex consisting of one type III receptor, two TGF-beta molecules, and four type II receptors, prior to the recruitment of the type I receptor for signal transduction. Additionally, our results indicate that the apparent dissociation rate constants are more predictive of the neutralizing potency of these TGF-beta-binding proteins (LAP, the type II and III receptor EDs, and the type II receptor/Fc chimera) than the apparent equilibrium constants.',\n",

According to flow cytometry, recombinant human TR6-Fc binds to human LIGHT expressed on 293 cells or on activated human T cells and competes with the LIGHT receptor TR2 for the binding to LIGHT on these cells. Human TR6 could cross-react with mouse LIGHT in immunoprecipitation. TR6-Fc also downregulates cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in vitro and graft-versus-host responses in mice. Moreover, TR6-Fc modulates lymphokine production by alloantigen-stimulated mouse T cells. TR6-Fc ameliorated rejection response to mouse heart allograft. These results indicate that TR6 can dampen T-cell responses to alloantigens. Such regulatory effects of TR6 probably occur via interference with interaction between pairs of related TNF and TNFR family members, LIGHT/TR2 being one of the possible candidate pairs.',\n",

By screening genomic DNA databases, we identified a gene encoding a protein of 231 aa, showing 33 and 34% amino acid identity with the extracellular domains of the IL-22 receptor and of the IL-20R/cytokine receptor family 2-8, respectively, but lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. A lower but significant sequence identity was found with other members of this family such as the IL-10R (29%), cytokine receptor family 2-4/IL-10Rbeta (30%), tissue factor (26%), and the four IFN receptor chains (23-25%). This gene is located on chromosome 6q24, at 35 kb from the IFNGR1 gene, and is expressed in various tissues with maximal expression in breast, lungs, and colon. The recombinant protein was found to bind IL-10-related T cell-derived inducible factor/IL-22, and to inhibit the activity of this cytokine on hepatocytes and intestinal epithelial cells.

       "  'Abstract': 'Normal human bone marrow stroma cells include stem cells for both haemopoietic and osteochondrogenic lineages and express both bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I and type II receptors. As a member of the TGF-beta super-family, BMP-6 binds to both BMP type I and type II receptors and is involved in the developmental processes of renal and hepatic systems as well as of human foetal intestine. Also, BMP-6 induces osteoblastic differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells and is an autocrine stimulator of chondrocyte differentiation. The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of BMP-6 on human cobblestone-area-forming cells (CAFC), that represent the functional primitive repopulating haemopoietic stem cell in long-term bone marrow culture. Also, the effect of BMP-6 on marrow stroma production of interleukin-6, -11 and their common receptor gp130 that is expressed in haemopoietic stem cells and is indispensable for their proliferation and tri-lineage differentiation was examined. Moreover, the effect of BMP-6 on marrow stroma release of soluble adhesion molecule VCAM-1 mediating the primitive haemopoietic stem cell adhesion to marrow stroma was examined. The number of CAFC was significantly reduced after BMP-6 treatment from 88+/-10 per 10(5)cells in control cultures in a dose dependent manner to only 48+/-3 per 10(5)cells in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated cultures, P< 0.01. Quantitative ELISA measurement revealed 50 ng/ml BMP-6 was able to significantly reduce IL-6 and IL-11 production from marrow stroma, P< 0.01. Also, BMP-6 significantly increased soluble gp130 release by 7.4-fold in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated marrow stroma cultures. The profound rapid increase in this natural antagonist of human IL-6 cytokine family may reduce the gp130 signaling. Also, the soluble VCAM-1 released increased by two-fold in 50 ng/ml BMP-6-treated marrow stroma cultures. The marked increase in the soluble form may exert an antagonist effect on the function of VCAM-1 (ligand for VLA4). Recently, blocking the VLA4/VCAM-1 adhesion pathway was shown to mobilise haemopoietic CD34 positive cells in normal individuals. Also, we previously observed a significantly lower expression of VLA4 (CD49d) on G-CSF-mobilised blood CD34 positive cells than on bone marrow CD34 positive cells before mobilisation in the same normal donors. Since BMP are currently being used in clinical trials for bone repair and fracture healing, the present results suggest a possible role for BMP-6 in mobilising CD34 positive cells for transplantation. Further in vitro tests are required to evaluate this potential mobilising role of BMP-6 in human long-term bone marrow culture.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'E-selectin plays a critical role in mediating tissue-specific homing of T cells into skin, and of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) into bone marrow (BM). Though it is known that a glycoform of PSGL-1 (CLA) functions as the principal E-selectin ligand on human T lymphocytes, the E-selectin ligand(s) of human HPCs has not been identified. We used a shear-based adherence assay to analyze and define the E-selectin ligand activity of membrane proteins from human HPCs. Our data show that PSGL-1 expressed on human HPCs is an E-selectin ligand, and that HPCs also express a previously unrecognized E-selectin ligand, CD44. The E-selectin ligand activity of CD44 is conferred by the elaboration of sialylated, fucosylated binding determinants on N-glycans. This glycoform of CD44 is expressed on primitive CD34+ human HPCs, but not on more mature hematopoietic cells. Under physiologic flow conditions, this molecule mediates E-selectin-dependent rolling interactions over a wider shear range than that of PSGL-1, and promotes human HPC rolling interactions on E-selectin expressed on human BM endothelial cells. These findings offer new insights into the structural biology and physiology of CD44, and into the molecular basis of E-selectin-dependent adhesive interactions that direct homing of human HPC to BM.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'E-selectin is an endothelial adhesion molecule, which mediates the tethering and rolling of leukocytes on vascular endothelium. It recognizes the glycoprotein E-selectin ligand-1 (ESL-1) as a major binding partner on mouse myeloid cells. Using surface plasmon resonance, we measured the kinetics and affinity of binding of monomeric E-selectin to ESL-1 isolated from mouse bone marrow cells. E-selectin bound to ESL-1 with a fast dissociation rate constant of 4.6 s(-1) and a calculated association rate constant of 7.4 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1). We determined a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 62 microm, which resembles the affinity of L-selectin binding to glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1. The affinity of the E-selectin-ESL-1 interaction did not change significantly when the temperature was varied from 5 degrees C to 37 degrees C, indicating that the enthalpic contribution to the binding is small at physiological temperatures, and that, in contrast to typical protein-carbohydrate interactions, binding is driven primarily by favorable entropic changes. Interestingly, surface plasmon resonance experiments with recombinant ESL-1 from alpha 1,3-fucosyltransferase IV-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells showed a very similar K(d) of 66 microm, suggesting that this fucosyltransferase is sufficient to produce fully functional recombinant ESL-1. Following the recent description of the affinity and kinetics of the selectin-ligand pairs L-selectin-glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 and P-selectin-P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, this is the first determination of the parameters of E-selectin binding to one of its naturally occurring ligands.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a 19-aa cyclic neuropeptide originally isolated from chum salmon pituitaries. Besides its effects on the aggregation of melanophores in fish several lines of evidence suggest that in mammals MCH functions as a regulator of energy homeostasis. Recently, several groups reported the identification of an orphan G protein-coupled receptor as a receptor for MCH (MCH-1R). We hereby report the identification of a second human MCH receptor termed MCH-2R, which shares about 38% amino acid identity with MCH-1R. MCH-2R displayed high-affinity MCH binding, resulting in inositol phosphate turnover and release of intracellular calcium in mammalian cells. In contrast to MCH-1R, MCH-2R signaling is not sensitive to pertussis toxin and MCH-2R cannot reduce forskolin-stimulated cAMP production, suggesting an exclusive G(alpha)q coupling of the MCH-2R in cell-based systems. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis of human and monkey tissue shows that expression of MCH-2R mRNA is restricted to several regions of the brain, including the arcuate nucleus and the ventral medial hypothalamus, areas implicated in regulation of body weight. In addition, the human MCH-2R gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6 at band 6q16.2-16.3, a region reported to be associated with cytogenetic abnormalities of obese patients. The characterization of a second mammalian G protein-coupled receptor for MCH potentially indicates that the control of energy homeostasis in mammals by the MCH neuropeptide system may be more complex than initially anticipated.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A peptide YY (PYY)-preferring receptor [PYY > neuropeptide Y (NPY)] was previously characterized in rat small intestinal crypt cells, where it mediates inhibition of fluid secretion. Here, we investigated the possible status of this receptor as a peripheral Y(2) receptor in rats. Typical Y(2) agonists (PYY(3-36), NPY(3-36), NPY(13-36), C2-NPY) and very short PYY analogs (N-alpha-Ac-PYY(22-36) and N-alpha-Ac-PYY(25-36)) acting at the intestinal PYY receptor were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of (125)I-PYY to membranes of rat intestinal crypt cells and of CHO cells stably transfected with the rat hippocampal Y(2) receptor cDNA. Similar PYY preference was observed and all analogs exhibited comparable high affinity in both binding assays. The same held true for the specific Y(2) antagonist BIIE0246 with a K(i) value of 6.5 and 9.0 nM, respectively. BIIE0246 completely abolished the inhibition of cAMP production by PYY in crypt cells and transfected CHO cells. Moreover, the antagonist 1) considerably reversed the PYY-induced reduction of short-circuit current in rat jejunum mucosa in Ussing chamber and 2) completely abolished the antisecretory action of PYY on vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-induced fluid secretion in rat jejunum in vivo. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments showed that Y(2) receptor transcripts were present in intestinal crypt cells (3 x 10(2) molecules/100 ng RNA(T)) with no expression in villus cells, in complete agreement with the exclusive binding of PYY in crypt cells. Finally, a full-length Y(2) receptor was cloned by RT-PCR from rat intestinal crypt cells and also from human small intestine. We conclude that the so-called PYY-preferring receptor mediating inhibition of intestinal secretion is a peripheral Y(2) receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recent genetic studies suggest that ephrins may function in a kinase-independent Eph receptor pathway. Here we report that expression of EphA8 in either NIH 3T3 or HEK293 cells enhanced cell adhesion to fibronectin via alpha(5)beta(1)- or beta(3) integrins. Interestingly, a kinase-inactive EphA8 mutant also markedly promoted cell attachment to fibronectin in these cell lines. Using a panel of EphA8 point mutants, we have demonstrated that EphA8 kinase activity does not correlate with its ability to promote cell attachment to fibronectin. Analysis using EphA8 extracellular and intracellular domain mutants has revealed that enhanced cell adhesion is dependent on ephrin A binding to the extracellular domain and the juxtamembrane segment of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. EphA8-promoted adhesion was efficiently inhibited by wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor. Additionally, we found that EphA8 had associated PI 3-kinase activity and that the p110gamma isoform of PI 3-kinase is associated with EphA8. In vitro binding experiments revealed that the EphA8 juxtamembrane segment was sufficient for the formation of a stable complex with p110gamma. Similar results were obtained in assay using cells stripped of endogenous ephrin A ligands by treatment with preclustered ephrin A5-Fc proteins. In addition, a membrane-targeted lipid kinase-inactive p110gamma mutant was demonstrated to stably associate with EphA8 and suppress EphA8-promoted cell adhesion to fibronectin. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of a novel mechanism by which the EphA8 receptor localizes p110gamma PI 3-kinase to the plasma membrane in a tyrosine kinase-independent fashion, thereby allowing access to lipid substrates to enable the signals required for integrin-mediated cell adhesion.',\n",

The mammalian peptides signal through two G protein-coupled receptor types to modulate endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stress, as well as a range of peripheral (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and immune) activities. The three previously known ligands are differentially distributed anatomically and have distinct specificities for the two major receptor types. Here we describe the characterization of an additional CRF-related peptide, urocortin III, in the human and mouse. In searching the public human genome databases we found a partial expressed sequence tagged (EST) clone with significant sequence identity to mammalian and fish urocortin-related peptides. By using primers based on the human EST sequence, a full-length human clone was isolated from genomic DNA that encodes a protein that includes a predicted putative 38-aa peptide structurally related to other known family members. With a human probe, we then cloned the mouse ortholog from a genomic library. Human and mouse urocortin III share 90% identity in the 38-aa putative mature peptide. In the peptide coding region, both human and mouse urocortin III are 76% identical to pufferfish urocortin-related peptide and more distantly related to urocortin II, CRF, and urocortin from other mammalian species. Mouse urocortin III mRNA expression is found in areas of the brain including the hypothalamus, amygdala, and brainstem, but is not evident in the cerebellum, pituitary, or cerebral cortex; it is also expressed peripherally in small intestine and skin. Urocortin III is selective for type 2 CRF receptors and thus represents another potential endogenous ligand for these receptors.',\n",

The EST has approximately 32% identity to the extracellular domain of FGFR1-4. Library screening with this EST identified two full-length alternative transcripts which we designated as FGFR5 beta and FGFR5 gamma. The main difference between these transcripts is that FGFR5 beta contains three extracellular Ig domains whereas FGFR5 gamma contains only two. A unique feature of FGFR5 is that it does not contain an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Predictive structural modelling of the extracellular domain of FGFR5 gamma suggested that it was a member of the I-set subgroup of the Ig-superfamily, consistent with the known FGFRs. Northern analysis of mouse and human FGFR5 showed detectable mRNA in a broad range of tissues, including kidney, brain and lung. Genomic sequencing identified four introns but identified no alternative transcripts containing a tyrosine kinase domain. Extracellular regions of FGFR5 beta and 5 gamma were cloned in-frame with the Fc fragment of human IgG(1) to generate recombinant non-membrane bound protein. Recombinant FGFR5 beta Fc and R5 gamma Fc demonstrated specific binding to the ligand FGF-2, but not FGF-7 or EGF. However, biological data suggest that FGF-2 binding to these proteins is with lower affinity than its cognate receptor FGFR2C.

Cells transfected with both receptor subunits proliferated in response to purified, recombinant human TSLP, with induced phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat5. Human TSLPR and IL-7Ralpha are principally coexpressed on monocytes and dendritic cell populations and to a much lesser extent on various lymphoid cells. In accord, we find that human TSLP functions mainly on myeloid cells; it induces the release of T cell-attracting chemokines from monocytes and, in particular, enhances the maturation of CD11c(+) dendritic cells, as evidenced by the strong induction of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80 and the enhanced capacity to elicit proliferation of naive T cells.',\n",

Several integrins including alpha(v)beta(3) can bind to multiple ligands. The binding of alpha(v)beta(3) to fibronectin and vitronectin was used as a model to determine whether the same or distinct forms of the receptor were utilized in strong binding to the two different ligands. A spinning-disc device was used to measure the relative strength of the alpha(v)beta(3)-ligand bonds. The initial binding reaction for both ligands occurred in the absence of metabolic energy and resulted in a strong adhesion to fibronectin but a weak adhesion to vitronectin. Increases in the strength of the alpha(v)beta(3)-vitronectin bond required phosphorylation of the beta(3) cytoplasmic domain, intracellular signals, and the binding of cytoskeletal proteins to cytoplasmic domains of beta(3) controlled by Tyr-747 and Tyr-759. In contrast, alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion to fibronectin was unaffected by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, mutations of Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 to phenylalanine, or availability of metabolic energy.

To understand the molecular basis for the interaction, an extensive mutagenesis study of fractalkine's chemokine domain was undertaken. The results reveal a cluster of basic residues (Lys-8, Lys-15, Lys-37, Arg-45, and Arg-48) and one aromatic (Phe-50) that are critical for binding and/or signaling. The mutant R48A could bind but not induce chemotaxis, demonstrating that Arg-48 is a signaling trigger. This result also shows that signaling residues are not confined to chemokine N termini, as generally thought. F50A showed no detectable binding, underscoring its importance to the stability of the complex. K15A displayed unique signaling characteristics, eliciting a wild-type calcium flux but minimal chemotaxis, suggesting that this mutant can activate some, but not all, pathways required for migration.

K. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15314-15320). In this study, we determined subcellular localization of COX-2 and caveolin-1 by confocal microscopy. COX-2 in human foreskin fibroblasts stimulated by PMA (100 nm) or interleukin-1beta (1 ng/ml) for 6 h was localized to plasma membrane in addition to endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Caveolin-1 was localized to plasma membrane, and image overlay showed colocalization of COX-2 with caveolin-1. This was confirmed by the presence of COX-2 and caveolin-1 in the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction of cells stimulated by PMA. Immunoprecipitation showed complex formation of COX-2 with caveolin-1 in a time-dependent manner. A larger quantity of COX-2 was complexed with caveolin-1 in PMA-treated than in interleukin-1beta-treated cells. Purified COX-2 complexed with glutathione S-transferase-fused caveolin-1, which was not inhibited by the scaffolding domain peptide. Caveolin-1-bound COX-2 was catalytically active, and its activity was not inhibited by the scaffolding domain peptide. These results suggest that COX-2 induced by PMA and interleukin-1beta is colocalized with caveolin-1 in the segregated caveolae compartment. Because caveolae are rich in signaling molecules, this COX-2 compartment may play an important role in diverse pathophysiological processes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The LW blood group glycoprotein, ICAM-4, is a member of the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) family expressed in erythroid cells. To begin to address the function of this molecule, ligands for ICAM-4 on hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cell lines were identified. Peptide inhibition studies suggest that adhesion of cell lines to an ICAM-4-Fc construct is mediated by an LDV-inhibitable integrin on hemopoietic cells and an RGD-inhibitable integrin on nonhemopoietic cells. Antibody inhibition studies identified the hemopoietic integrin as alpha(4)beta(1.) Antibody inhibition studies on alpha(4)beta(1)-negative, nonhemopoietic cell lines suggested that adhesion of these cells is mediated by alpha(V) integrins (notably alpha(V)beta(1) and alpha(V)beta(5)). The structure of ICAM-4 modeled on the crystal structure of ICAM-2 was used to identify surface-exposed amino acid residues for site-directed mutagenesis. Neither an unusual LETS nor an LDV motif in the first domain of ICAM-4 was critical for integrin binding. ICAM-4 is the first ICAM family member shown to be a ligand for integrins other than those of the beta(2) family, and the data suggest that ICAM-4 has a novel integrin-binding site(s). These findings suggest a role for ICAM-4 in normal erythropoiesis and may also be relevant to the adhesive interactions of sickle cells.',\n",

Here we provide evidence that CD155 binds specifically to vitronectin with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 72 nM as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Based on sequence homology to the CD155 gene, three poliovirus receptor-related genes (PRR1, PRR2, and PRR3) were cloned recently. PRR proteins were reported by others to mediate homophilic cell adhesion. Neither PRR1 nor PRR2 binds poliovirus and it is assumed that their physiological functions differ from that of CD155. Indeed, mPRR2 was found to bind to vitronectin only weakly, while its self-adhesion activity is characterized by a K(d) of 310 nM. Moreover, there is no evidence for CD155 self-adhesion. Both CD155 and vitronectin colocalize to follicular dendritic cells and B cells inside the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid tissue (tonsils)-an observation suggesting that the CD155/vitronectin interaction is required for the establishment of a proper immune response in this particular context.',\n",

We found that lymphotactin induced preferential migration of antigen-specific (CD62L(lo)) T cells over the nonspecific (CD62L(hi)) T cells in vitro and in vivo. The differing migratory abilities correlated with higher levels of mRNA encoding the lymphotactin receptor (XCR1) on the CD62L(lo) cells compared to the CD62L(hi) cells. Thus, we have identified a coupling mechanism between the activation of T cells and acquisition of new homing properties, in this case conferred by XCR1 expression.

       "  'Abstract': 'The establishment and maintenance of cellular polarity are critical for the development of multicellular organisms. PAR (partitioning-defective) proteins were identified in Caenorhabditis elegans as determinants of asymmetric cell division and polarized cell growth. Recently, vertebrate orthologues of two of these proteins, ASIP/PAR-3 and PAR-6, were found to form a signalling complex with the small GTPases Cdc42/Rac1 and with atypical protein kinase C (PKC). Here we show that ASIP/PAR-3 associates with the tight-junction-associated protein junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) in vitro and in vivo. No binding was observed with claudin-1, -4 or -5. In fibroblasts and CHO cells overexpressing JAM, endogenous ASIP is recruited to JAM at sites of cell-cell contact. Over expression of truncated JAM lacking the extracellular part disrupts ASIP/PAR-3 localization at intercellular junctions and delays ASIP/PAR-3 recruitment to newly formed cell junctions. During junction formation, JAM appears early in primordial forms of junctions. Our data suggest that the ASIP/PAR-3-aPKC complex is tethered to tight junctions via its association with JAM, indicating a potential role for JAM in the generation of cell polarity in epithelial cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recently, the LD78beta isoform of the CC chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha was shown to efficiently chemoattract lymphocytes and monocytes and to inhibit infection of mononuclear cells by R5 HIV-1 strains. We have now demonstrated that after cleavage of the NH2-terminal Ala-Pro dipeptide by CD26, LD78beta(3 - 70) became the most potent chemokine blocking HIV-1. LD78beta(3 - 70) competed tenfold more efficiently than LD78beta(1 - 70) with [125I] RANTES for binding to the CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR1. Contrary to LD78alpha, LD78beta(1 - 70) at 30 ng/ml efficiently competed with [125I] RANTES for binding to CCR3 and mobilized calcium in CCR3 transfectants, whereas LD78beta(3 - 70) showed a 30-fold decrease in CCR3 affinity compared to LD78beta(1 - 70). This demonstrates the importance of the penultimate proline in LD78beta(1 - 70) for CCR3 recognition. Both LD78beta isoforms efficiently chemoattracted eosinophils from responsive donors. In contrast, only the CCR3 agonist LD78beta(1 - 70) and not LD78beta(3 - 70), induced calcium increases in eosinophils with low levels of CCR1. In responder neutrophils, LD78beta(3 - 70) elicited calcium fluxes at a 30-fold lower dose (10 ng/ml) compared to intact LD78beta and LD78alpha, whereas the three MIP-1alpha isoforms were equipotent neutrophil chemoattractants. Taken together, both LD78beta isoforms are potent HIV-1 inhibitors (CCR5) and activators for neutrophils (CCR1) and eosinophils (CCR1, CCR3), affecting infection and inflammation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Myostatin is a transforming growth factor-beta family member that acts as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. To identify possible myostatin inhibitors that may have applications for promoting muscle growth, we investigated the regulation of myostatin signaling. Myostatin protein purified from mammalian cells consisted of a noncovalently held complex of the N-terminal propeptide and a disulfide-linked dimer of C-terminal fragments. The purified C-terminal myostatin dimer was capable of binding the activin type II receptors, Act RIIB and, to a lesser extent, Act RIIA. Binding of myostatin to Act RIIB could be inhibited by the activin-binding protein follistatin and, at higher concentrations, by the myostatin propeptide. To determine the functional significance of these interactions in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing high levels of the propeptide, follistatin, or a dominant-negative form of Act RIIB by using a skeletal muscle-specific promoter. Independent transgenic mouse lines for each construct exhibited dramatic increases in muscle mass comparable to those seen in myostatin knockout mice. Our findings suggest that the propeptide, follistatin, or other molecules that block signaling through this pathway may be useful agents for enhancing muscle growth for both human therapeutic and agricultural applications.',\n",

Although unactivated platelets express numerous copies of GPIIb-IIIa on their surface, spontaneous, and potentially deleterious, platelet aggregation is prevented by tightly regulating the fibrinogen binding activity of GPIIb-IIIa. Preliminary evidence suggests that it is the submembranous actin or actin-associated proteins that constrains GPIIb-IIIa in a low affinity state and that relief of this constraint by initiating actin filament turnover enables GPIIb-IIIa to bind fibrinogen. Two regions of the fibrinogen alpha chain that contain an RGD motif, as well as the carboxyl-terminus of the fibrinogen gamma chain, represent potential binding sites for GPIIb-IIIa in the fibrinogen molecule. However, ultrastructural studies using purified fibrinogen and GPIIb-IIIa, and studies using recombinant fibrinogen in which the RGD and relevant gamma chain motifs were mutated indicate that sequences located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the gamma chain mediates fibrinogen binding to GPIIb-IIIa. There is evidence that fibrinogen itself binds to regions in the amino terminal portions of both GPIIb and GPIIIa and that the sites interacting with the fibrinogen gamma chain and with RGD-containing peptides are spatially distinct. Nonetheless, there appears to be allosteric linkage between these sites, accounting for the ability of RGD-containing peptides to inhibit platelet aggregation and arterial thrombosis.',\n",

Together, these represent a new Class I receptor family. Our aim in the present work is to gain insight into the molecular basis of binding of motilin to its receptor using photoaffinity labeling. To achieve this, we developed a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that overexpressed functional motilin receptor (CHO-MtlR; 175,000 sites per cell, with K(i) = 2.3 +/- 0.4 nm motilin and EC(50) = 0.3 +/- 0.1 nm motilin) and a radioiodinatable peptide analogue of human motilin that incorporated a photolabile p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) residue into its pharmacophoric domain. This probe, [Bpa(1),Ile(13)]motilin, was a full agonist at the motilin receptor that increased intracellular calcium in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50) = 1.5 +/- 0.4 nm). This photolabile ligand bound specifically and with high affinity to the motilin receptor (K(i) = 12.4 +/- 1.0 nm), and covalently labeled that molecule within its M(r) = 45,000 deglycosylated core. Cyanogen bromide cleavage demonstrated its covalent attachment to fragments of the receptor having apparent M(r) = 6,000 and M(r) = 31,000. These were demonstrated to represent fragments that included both the first and the large second extracellular loop domains, with the latter representing a unique structural feature of this receptor.

None of this integrin's known ligands, however, appears to account for this phenotype. To identify a more relevant ligand, a soluble integrin alpha8beta1 heterodimer fused to alkaline phosphatase (AP) has been used to probe blots and cDNA libraries. In newborn mouse kidney extracts, alpha8beta1-AP detects a novel ligand of 70-90 kD. This protein, named nephronectin, is an extracellular matrix protein with five EGF-like repeats, a mucin region containing a RGD sequence, and a COOH-terminal MAM domain. Integrin alpha8beta1 and several additional RGD-binding integrins bind nephronectin. Nephronectin mRNA is expressed in the ureteric bud epithelium, whereas alpha8beta1 is expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme. Nephronectin is localized in the extracellular matrix in the same distribution as the ligand detected by alpha8beta1-AP and forms a complex with alpha8beta1 in vivo. Thus, these results strongly suggest that nephronectin is a relevant ligand mediating alpha8beta1 function in the kidney. Nephronectin is expressed at numerous sites outside the kidney, so it may also have wider roles in development. The approaches used here should be generally useful for characterizing the interactions of novel extracellular matrix proteins identified through genomic sequencing projects.\",\n",

A critical question has been how the activation of these receptors is regulated. Most, if not all, of the known ligands for these receptors are soluble factors. However, as matrix components are highly tissue-specific and change during development and pathology, it has been suggested that select growth factor receptors might be stimulated by binding to matrix components. Herein, we describe a new class of ligand for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) found within the EGF-like repeats of tenascin-C, an antiadhesive matrix component present during organogenesis, development, and wound repair. Select EGF-like repeats of tenascin-C elicited mitogenesis and EGFR autophosphorylation in an EGFR-dependent manner. Micromolar concentrations of EGF-like repeats induced EGFR autophosphorylation and activated extracellular signal-regulated, mitogen-activated protein kinase to levels comparable to those induced by subsaturating levels of known EGFR ligands. EGFR-dependent adhesion was noted when the ligands were tethered to inert beads, simulating the physiologically relevant presentation of tenascin-C as hexabrachion, and suggesting an increase in avidity similar to that seen for integrin ligands upon surface binding. Specific binding to EGFR was further established by immunofluorescence detection of EGF-like repeats bound to cells and cross-linking of EGFR with the repeats. Both of these interactions were abolished upon competition by EGF and enhanced by dimerization of the EGF-like repeat. Such low affinity behavior would be expected for a matrix-\"tethered\" ligand; i.e., a ligand which acts from the matrix, presented continuously to cell surface EGF receptors, because it can neither diffuse away nor be internalized and degraded.

The results show that in normal rats mechanical and cold allodynia of the hindpaw are induced after intrathecal infusion of low-dose galanin (25 ng per 0.5 microl/h). The same effect is seen with equimolar doses of AR-M1896 or AR-M961, an agonist both at GalR1 and GalR2 receptors.

       "  'Title': 'Identification of receptor and heparin binding sites in fibroblast growth factor 4 by structure-based mutagenesis.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) comprise a large family of multifunctional, heparin-binding polypeptides that show diverse patterns of interaction with a family of receptors (FGFR1 to -4) that are subject to alternative splicing. FGFR binding specificity is an essential mechanism in the regulation of FGF signaling and is achieved through primary sequence differences among FGFs and FGFRs and through usage of two alternative exons, IIIc and IIIb, for the second half of immunoglobulin-like domain 3 (D3) in FGFRs. While FGF4 binds and activates the IIIc splice forms of FGFR1 to -3 at comparable levels, it shows little activity towards the IIIb splice forms of FGFR1 to -3 as well as towards FGFR4. To begin to explore the structural determinants for this differential affinity, we determined the crystal structure of FGF4 at a 1.8-A resolution. FGF4 adopts a beta-trefoil fold similar to other FGFs. To identify potential receptor and heparin binding sites in FGF4, a ternary FGF4-FGFR1-heparin model was constructed by superimposing the FGF4 structure onto FGF2 in the FGF2-FGFR1-heparin structure. Mutation of several key residues in FGF4, observed to interact with FGFR1 or with heparin in the model, produced ligands with reduced receptor binding and concomitant low mitogenic potential. Based on the modeling and mutational data, we propose that FGF4, like FGF2, but unlike FGF1, engages the betaC'-betaE loop in D3 and thus can differentiate between the IIIc and IIIb splice isoforms of FGFRs for binding. Moreover, we show that FGF4 needs to interact with both the 2-O- and 6-O-sulfates in heparin to exert its optimal biological activity.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Because of its major role in regulating platelet functions and its prominence on the cell surface, integrin alphaIIbbeta3 has been the subject of intensive investigations. Such studies have provided substantial insights into its structure-function relationships and have led to the development of anti-thrombotic drugs that target the receptor. Nevertheless, recent findings have indicated that our understanding of the structure and function of alphaIIbbeta3 remains inadequate. This article addresses two aspects of still evolving alphaIIbbeta3 function: 1) the interface between alphaIIbbeta3 and the blood coagulation system, resulting from interaction of prothrombin with the receptor; and 2) the molecular basis for recognition of the RGD and the fibrinogen gamma-chain peptide ligands by alphaIIbbeta3. As illustrated by these two examples, there is still much to be learned about alphaIIbbeta3 if we are to fully appreciate its functions and its potential as a therapeutic target.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': '1. Arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART1) is expressed on the surface of a number of cell types, and catalyses the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD(+) to target proteins. We investigated whether extracellular proteins such as growth factors may serve as substrates for this enzyme, with subsequent alteration in their biological activity. Experiments were performed with rat skeletal muscle membranes and V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts with doxycycline-inducible expression of human ART. 2. From a panel of growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) was found to be the best substrate for ART1, whereas the structural homologue PDGF-AA was not a substrate. Under conditions of maximum labelling 5 mol ADP-ribose was incorporated per mol of PDGF-BB. 3. Purified (ADP-ribosyl)-PDGF-BB did not stimulate a mitogenic or chemotactic response in human pulmonary smooth muscle cells, and showed a reduced capacity to bind to PDGF receptors in competition binding experiments, when compared to unmodified PDGF-BB. 4. PDGF-dependent [(3)H-methyl]-thymidine incorporation was measured in the ART1-transfected fibroblast cell line at physiological concentrations of PDGF-BB, and without addition of extracellular NAD(+). Fibroblasts expressing human ART1 at the cell surface showed reduced mitogenic responses to PDGF-BB, but not to PDGF-AA. This loss of mitogenic response in cells expressing ART1 activity was reversed by the addition of agmatine (an ART1 substrate). 5. In conclusion, we propose that PDGF-BB-dependent signalling may be regulated by post-translational modification of the growth factor by ART1 at the cell surface. This has been demonstrated in membranes of rat skeletal muscle, and the reaction confirmed in ART1-transfected fibroblasts.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The interaction between urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its cellular receptor (uPAR) is a key event in cell surface-associated plasminogen activation, relevant for cell migration and invasion. In order to define receptor recognition sites for uPA, we have expressed uPAR fragments as fusion products with the minor coat protein on the surface of M13 bacteriophages. Sequence analysis of cDNA fragments encoding uPA-binding peptides indicated the existence of a composite uPA-binding structure including all three uPAR domains. This finding was confirmed by experiments using an overlapping 15-mer peptide array covering the entire uPAR molecule. Four regions within the uPAR sequence were found to directly bind to uPA: two distinct regions containing amino acids 13--20 and amino acids 74--84 of the uPAR domain I, and regions in the putative loop 3 of the domains II and III. All the uPA-binding fragments from the three domains were shown to have an agonistic effect on uPA binding to immobilized uPAR. Furthermore, uPAR-(154--176) increased uPAR-transfected BAF3-cell adhesion on vitronectin in the presence of uPA, whereas uPAR-(247--276) stimulated the cell adhesion both in the absence or presence of uPA. The latter fragment was also able to augment the binding of vitronectin to uPAR in a purified system, thereby mimicking the effect of uPA on this interaction. These results indicate that uPA binding can take place to particular part(s) on several uPAR molecules and that direct uPAR-uPAR contacts may contribute to receptor activation and ligand binding.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Although the intracellular domain of Notch1 is phosphorylated and it associates with members of the CSL family, the relationship of these events is poorly understood. Using in vivo [(32)P]orthophosphate labeling of cells expressing transfected Notch1, we observed that the furin cleaved Notch1 (TMIC) and the soluble intracellular forms (NICD), but not the full-length molecule were phosphorylated. Furthermore, transfected NICD molecules showed a significantly greater specific activity of phosphorylation, or hyperphosphorylation, compared to TMIC molecules. Hyperphosphorylation of NICD was also observed when NICD was generated by an endogenous intramembraneous cleavage of TMIC. However, TMIC molecules bearing a mutation that reduces intramembraneous cleavage (V1744K) did not show an enhanced incorporation of phosphate, suggesting that cleavage is required for hyperphosphorylation. Using deletion constructs to map the sites of phosphorylation, we observed that a domain of 93 amino acids downstream of the ankyrin repeats incorporated the majority of (32)P in vivo. This sequence was also required for activation of the HES-1 promoter. In addition, we observed that hyperphosphorylated forms of the intracellular domain were more likely to interact with the transcriptional coactivator RBP. However, dephosphorylation experiments showed that the interaction between RBP and the intracellular domain of Notch was not dependent upon Notch1IC phosphorylation. These studies reveal that phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor is a dynamic process during the events of Notch signal transduction.',\n",

Here we demonstrate that extracellularly truncated Notch homologs are substrates for a presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase activity. Despite minimal conservation within the transmembrane domain, the requirement for a specific amino acid (P1' valine) and its position at the cleavage site relative to the cytosolic border of the transmembrane domain are preserved. Cleaved, untethered Notch intracellular domains from each receptor translocate to the nucleus and interact with the transcriptional regulatory protein CSL. All four Notch proteins display presenilin-dependent transactivating potential on a minimal promoter reporter. Thus, this study increases the number of biochemically characterized gamma-secretase substrates from two to five. Despite a high degree of structural homology and the presenilin-dependent activity of truncated Notch proteins, the extent that this reflects functional redundancy is unknown.\",\n",

Imidazolyl derivatives 2 were found to bind with moderate affinity but with high selectivity to the sst(3) receptor subtype. Further modifications of these structures led to a more potent class of ligands, the tetrahydro-beta-carboline derivatives 4. Among these, compounds 4k (BN81644) and 4n (BN81674) bind selectively and with high affinity to the sst(3) receptor subtype (K(i) = 0.64 and 0.92 nM, respectively).

The most potent compound 4n was shown to be a competitive antagonist of human sst(3) receptors by increasing the EC(50) of SRIF-14-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation with a K(B) of 2.8 nM (where K(B) is the concentration of antagonist that shifts the agonist dose-response 2-fold). These new derivatives are, to our knowledge, the first potent and highly selective non-peptide human sst(3) antagonists known and, as such, are useful tools for investigating the physiological role of sst(3) receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Nectins are adhesion molecules that participate in the organization of epithelial and endothelial junctions and serve as receptors for herpes simplex virus entry. They belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily, are homologues of the poliovirus receptor (PVR/CD155), and were also named poliovirus receptor-related (PRR) proteins. We identify a new member of the nectin family named nectin4. Peptide sequences of human and murine nectin4 share 92% identity, and as for other members, the ectodomain is made of three immunoglobulin-like domains of V, C, C types. In contrast to other nectin molecules, detection of nectin4 transcripts is mainly restricted to placenta in human tissues. Expression is broader in mouse, and interestingly nectin4 is detected at days 11, 15, and 17 during murine embryogenesis. Nectin4 interacts with afadin, a F-actin-associated molecule, via its carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic sequence. Both molecules co-localize at cadherin-based adherens junctions in the MDCKII epithelial cell line. Nectins are homophilic adhesion molecules, and recently heterophilic interactions have been described between nectin3/nectin1 and nectin3/nectin2. We confirmed these trans-interactions and also described nectin3 as the PVR/CD155 ligand. By means of several approaches, we report on the identification of nectin4 as a new ligand for nectin1. First, a soluble chimeric recombinant nectin4 ectodomain (nectin4-Fc) trans-interacts with cells expressing nectin1 but not with cells expressing nectin2, nectin3, or PVR/CD155. Conversely, nectin1-Fc binds to cells expressing nectin4. Second, nectin1-Fc precipitates nectin4 expressed in COS cells. Third, reciprocal in vitro physical interactions were detected between nectin4-Fc and nectin1-Fc. The nectin4-Fc/nectin4-Fc interaction was detected suggesting that nectin4 exhibits both homophilic and heterophilic properties. Using the same approaches we demonstrate, for the first time, that the V domain of nectin1 acts as a major functional region involved in trans-heterointeraction with nectin4 and also nectin3.',\n",

The chemokine receptor BLR1 (Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1)/CXCR5 expressed by all mature B cells has to date been identified as the only known receptor for BCA-1. As the loss of the BLR1/CXCR5 receptor is sufficient to disrupt organization of follicles in spleen and Peyer's patches, BCA-1 may act as a B cell homing chemokine. Nonetheless, BCA-1 has not been tested against all known chemokine receptors. In this study, we report that human BCA-1 competes with radiolabeled interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) inducible protein 10 (IP-10) for binding to the human CXCR3 receptor expressed in Ba/F3 and 293EBNA cell lines. Furthermore, human BCA-1 is an efficacious attractant for human CXCR3 transfected cells; BCA-1-induced chemotaxis is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against human CXCR3. In these cells, as in human B lymphocytes expressing CXCR5, BCA-1 does not induce a calcium flux. Indeed, BCA-1 attenuates the calcium flux induced by IP-10. In addition, human BCA-1 is an agonist in stimulating GTP gamma S binding. Together these data suggest that human BCA-1 is a specific and functional G-protein-linked chemotactic ligand for the human CXCR3 receptor. The biological significance of this new finding is supported by our recent observation that human BCA-1 induces chemotaxis of activated T cells and the BCA-1-induced chemotaxis is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against human CXCR3.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'HER3 (also known as c-Erb-b3) is a type I receptor tyrosine kinase similar in sequence to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. The extracellular segment of this transmembrane receptor contains four domains. Domains I and II are similar in sequence to domains III and IV, respectively, and domains II and IV are cysteine-rich. We show that the EGF-like domain of heregulin (hrg) binds to domains I and II of HER3, in contrast to the EGF receptor, for which prior studies have shown that a construct consisting of domains III and portions of domain IV binds EGF. Next, we identified a putative hrg binding site by limited proteolysis of the recombinant extracellular domains of HER3 (HER3-ECD(I-IV)) in both the presence and absence of hrg. In the absence of hrg, HER3-ECD(I-IV) is cleaved after position Tyr(50), near the beginning of domain I. Binding of hrg to HER3-ECD(I-IV) fully protects position Tyr(50) from proteolysis. To confirm that domain I contains a hrg binding site, we expressed domains I and II (HER3-ECD(I-II)) and find that it binds hrg with 68 nm affinity. These data suggest that domains I and II of HER3-ECD(I-IV) act as a functional unit in folding and binding of hrg. Thus, our biochemical findings reinforce the structural hypothesis of others that HER3-ECD(I-IV) is similar to the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), as follows: 1) The protected cleavage site in HER3-ECD(I-IV) corresponds to a binding footprint in domain I of IGF-1R; 2) HER3-ECD(I-II) binds hrg with a 68 nm dissociation constant, supporting the hypothesis that domain I is involved in ligand binding; and 3) the large accessible surface area (1749 A) of domain L1 of IGF-1R that is buried by domain S1, as well as the presence of conserved contacts in this interface of type 1 RTKs, suggests that domains L1 and S1 of IGF-1R function as a unit as observed for HER3-ECD(I-II). Our results are consistent with the proposal that HER3 has a structure similar to IGF-1R and binds ligand at a site in corresponding domains.',\n",

These receptors belonging to the LDLR family are thought to play key roles in lipoprotein metabolism in a variety of tissues, including the arterial wall. We have discovered that the expression of a 250-kDa mosaic LDLR-related protein, which we termed LR11 for the presence of 11 LDLR ligand-binding repeats, is markedly induced in smooth muscle cells in the hyperplastic intima of animal models used for the study of atherosclerosis. Here, we demonstrate that the human LR11, when overexpressed in hamster cells, binds and internalizes 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), an in vitro ligand for all receptors belonging to the LDLR family. Furthermore, LR11 binds the apolipoprotein E (apoE)-rich lipoproteins, beta-very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs), with a high affinity similar to that of other members, such as the LDLR and VLDL receptor. RAP and beta-VLDL compete with each other; however, other serum lipoproteins are not able to inhibit their binding. LR11 shows specific binding of apoE-enriched HDL prepared from human cerebrospinal fluid as well as of beta-VLDL, suggesting that the apoE content of lipoproteins is most likely important for mediating the high-affinity binding to the receptor. LR11-overexpressing cells are able to internalize and degrade the bound beta-VLDL; these cells also show increased accumulation of cholesteryl esters when incubated with beta-VLDL. Incubation for 48 hours with beta-VLDL of LR11-overexpressing cells, but not of control cells, promotes the appearance of numerous intracellular lipid droplets. Taken together, LR11, a mosaic LDLR family member whose expression in smooth muscle cells is markedly induced in atheroma, has all the properties of a receptor for the endocytosis of lipoproteins, particularly for the incorporation of apoE-rich lipoproteins.',\n",

Immunoanalysis of membranes prepared from cells expressing a c-myc-tagged version of hNT1-R revealed multiple c-myc cross-reacting polypeptides of high molecular mass, suggesting that hNT1-R was glycosylated in yeast. High-affinity binding sites for 125I-labeled-[monoiodo-Tyr3]neurotensin ([125I-Tyr3]NT) were detected on hNT1-R-expressing cells with Kd and Bmax values of 3.2 nM and of 500 receptors per cell, respectively. Competition binding studies of neurotensin with SR142948 and SR48692, two nonpeptidic antagonists of hNT1-R, indicated that the yeast-produced recombinant receptor displayed the same pharmacological properties as hNT1-R expressed in mammalian cells. Interestingly, neurotensin activated the pheromone pathway in hNT1-R-expressing cells in a dose-dependent fashion, as revealed by a beta-galactosidase activity assay with a pheromone-responsive Fus1:lacZ construct. Mutational inactivation of the SST2 and STE2 genes increased the level of beta-galactosidase activity in response to neurotensin by twofold. Recombinant hNT1-R-producing cells, which lacked the endogenous G-protein-coupled receptor for the alpha pheromone, mated with wild-type MATalpha haploid cells in response to neurotensin, leading to bona fide diploid zygote formation. This is the first report of a mammalian receptor that can replace the endogenous pheromone receptor when produced in yeast, by signaling a fully effective, agonist-induced, mating process.',\n",

Here we provide evidence that C1q and mannose binding lectin (MBL), a member of the collectin family of proteins, bind to apoptotic cells and stimulate ingestion of these by ligation on the phagocyte surface of the multifunctional protein, calreticulin (also known as the cC1qR), which in turn is bound to the endocytic receptor protein CD91, also known as the alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor. Use of these proteins provides another example of apoptotic cell clearance mediated by pattern recognition molecules of the innate immune system. Ingestion of the apoptotic cells through calreticulin/CD91 stimulation is further shown to involve the process of macropinocytosis, implicated as a primitive and relatively nonselective uptake mechanism for C1q- and MBL-enhanced engulfment of whole, intact apoptotic cells, as well as cell debris and foreign organisms to which these molecules may bind.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway is involved in patterning and development of a variety of organ systems, including the nervous system, the skeletal system, the craniofacial structures, and the gastrointestinal tract. Recent evidence also implicates this signaling pathway in the postembryonic regulation of stem-cell number in epithelia and blood. The family of HH proteins consists of at least three different members, i.e., sonic HH (SHH), Indian HH (IHH), and desert HH (DHH). SHH is the most broadly expressed member of this family and is probably responsible for the major effects of this signaling pathway. The HH signal is received and transduced via a specific receptor complex composed of patched (PTCH) and smoothened (SMOH) transmembrane proteins. Abnormalities in this signaling cascade have been found in various developmental pathologies and neoplasms such as basal cell carcinoma. The abnormalities are associated with congenital or sporadic genetic alteration affecting function of different components of the HH signaling pathway, including SHH, PTCH, SMOH and GLI proteins.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'IL-10-related cytokines include IL-20 and IL-22, which induce, respectively, keratinocyte proliferation and acute phase production by hepatocytes, as well as IL-19, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 7, and AK155, three cytokines for which no activity nor receptor complex has been described thus far. Here, we show that mda-7 and IL-19 bind to the previously described IL-20R complex, composed by cytokine receptor family 2-8/IL-20Ralpha and DIRS1/IL-20Rbeta (type I IL-20R). In addition, mda-7 and IL-20, but not IL-19, bind to another receptor complex, composed by IL-22R and DIRS1/IL20Rbeta (type II IL-20R). In both cases, binding of the ligands results in STAT3 phosphorylation and activation of a minimal promoter including STAT-binding sites. Taken together, these results demonstrate that: 1) IL-20 induces STAT activation through IL-20R complexes of two types; 2) mda-7 and IL-20 redundantly signal through both complexes; and 3) IL-19 signals only through the type I IL-20R complex.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CD84 is a member of the CD2 subset of the Ig superfamily of cell surface molecules. Its cytoplasmic tail binds to Src homology 2 domain-containing protein 1A (signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-associated protein), a protein encoded by the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease gene. It is preferentially expressed on B lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets. We show that it is also expressed on thymocytes and T cells. CD84 was positive on CD4-CD8- thymocytes, and its expression decreased with cell maturation. It is expressed on mature T cells preferentially on CD45RO+. To identify the CD84 ligand, we generated a soluble Ig fusion protein containing the human CD84 extracellular domains (CD84-Ig). Because receptor-ligand interactions occur between several members of this subfamily, we assayed CD84-Ig binding with all members of the CD2 family. CD84-Ig bound to CD84-transfected cells, whereas no binding was detected with cells expressing other CD2 subfamily receptors, showing that CD84 binds to itself. Anti-CD84 mAbs recognizing epitopes wholly within domain 1 of CD84 blocked the binding of the CD84-Ig fusion protein to CD84-transfected cells and platelets. Data from CD84 domain human/mouse chimeras further revealed that only the first extracellular domain of the molecule is involved in the ligand receptor recognition. The CD84-CD84 interaction was independent of its cytoplasmic tail. Finally, concurrent ligation of human CD84 with mAbs or CD84-Ig and CD3 enhanced IFN-gamma secretion in human lymphocytes. Thus, CD84 is its own ligand and acts as a costimulatory molecule.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'RANK, the receptor activator of NF-kappaB, and its ligand RANKL (initially termed TRANCE, also termed ODF and OPGL), are a TNF superfamily receptor-ligand pair that govern the development and function of osteoclasts, lymphoid tissue, and mammary epithelium. While TNF family cytokines share a common structural scaffold, individual receptor-ligand pairs associate with high specificity. Given the low level of amino acid conservation among members of the TNF superfamily, the means by which these molecules achieve specificity cannot be completely understood without knowledge of their three-dimensional structures. To determine the elements of RANKL that mediate RANK activation, we have crystallized the ectodomain of murine RANKL and solved its structure to a resolution of 2.6 A. RANKL self-associates as a homotrimer with four unique surface loops that distinguish it from other TNF family cytokines. Mutagenesis of selected residues in these loops significantly modulates RANK activation, as evidenced by in vitro osteoclastogenesis, thereby establishing their necessity in mediating the biological activities of RANKL. Such structural determinants of RANKL-RANK specificity may be of relevance in the pharmacologic design of compounds to ameliorate osteopenic disorders of bone.',\n",

We hypothesized that the inflammatory potential of bronchial epithelium is affected by its local environment and explored this hypothesis with respect to the effect of IL-9 on bronchial epithelium. We investigated the response of primary and immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells to IL-9 stimulation with respect to the release of T-cell chemoattractant factors. In response to IL-9, the HBE4-E6/E7 cell line, but not BEAS-2B cells, released the T-cell chemoattractants IL-16 and regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) in a dose-dependent fashion. We found a similar dose response to IL-9 in primary cells from bronchial brushings of healthy subjects and that nearly all of the T-cell chemoattraction was attributable to IL-16 and RANTES. Reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction of BEAS-2B, HBE4-E6/E7, and primary cells from two subjects revealed messenger RNA for IL-9 receptor (IL-9R) alpha but not in BEAS-2B cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of HBE4-E6/E7 and primary cells confirmed surface expression of the IL-9 receptor. Costimulation of both cell types with IL-9 and antibody to either gamma-common chain or IL-9Ralpha completely blocked the release of T-cell chemoattractant activity, confirming the primary role of a functioning IL-9 receptor for IL-9 signaling in HBE4-E6/E7 and primary bronchial epithelial cells. We conclude that IL-9 is a stimulus for airway epithelial cell release of T-cell chemoattractant factors, which in turn may modulate the immune response in allergic airway inflammation.',\n",

The coding region is distributed over 9 exons and maps to chromosome 11q25. The gene shows widespread tissue expression with higher levels apparent in the kidney, brain, and placenta. At the cellular level we show expression of JAM3 transcript within endothelial cells. Our major finding is that JAM3 and JAM2 are binding partners. Thus, JAM3 ectodomain binds firmly to JAM2-Fc. This heterotypic interaction is maintained when JAM3-Fc is used to capture Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing full-length JAM2. In static adhesion assays we show that JAM3 is unable to bind to leukocyte cell lines. This is consistent with the lack of JAM2 expression. However, using JAM2-Fc pull-down experiments in combination with polyclonal anti-JAM3 serum, we demonstrate that JAM3 is the previously uncharacterized 43-kDa counter-receptor that mediates JAM2 adhesion to T cells. Most significantly we demonstrate up-regulation of JAM3 protein on peripheral blood lymphocytes following activation.

The NH(2)-terminal domain (N-domain) of CEACAM6 expressed on a CHO cell was suggested to bind the N-domain of CEACAM6 or CEACAM8 on the opposing cell. By homologue-scanning mutagenesis, we found that the locations of the sequences critical for the adhesion of CEACAM6 to itself and to CEACAM8 are overlapped and that they are highly similar but not identical to the locations of the residues previously shown to be essential for the binding of CEACAM antigens to Opa proteins of pathogenic NEISSERIAE: Our findings imply that subtle differences in the N-domain sequences determine the specificity of the CEACAM antigens on neutrophils for interaction with the same or different CEACAM antigens and the bacterial proteins.',\n",

Binding assays performed in Bowes cells known to express human galanin receptor type 1 (hGalR1) and in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human galanin receptor type 2 (hGalR2) revealed that all three ligands had comparable affinities: at hGalR1<1 nM and at hGalR2<10 nM. However, in rat hippocampal membranes M242 had a 24-fold lower affinity than galanin (9.4 vs. 0.4 nM) and 134-fold lower affinity than M32 (9.4 vs. 0.07 nM). In the same tissue, we also examined the effects of these peptides on adenylate cyclase activity.

       "  'Abstract': \"The parathyroid hormone (PTH) 2 receptor is potently activated by tuberoinfundibular peptide (TIP39). Rat and human PTH2 receptors differ considerably in their PTH responsiveness. PTH weakly stimulates cAMP accumulation via the rat receptor, and here we show it did not detectably increase intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and bound with low affinity (450 nM). For the human PTH2 receptor PTH was a full agonist for increasing cAMP, a partial agonist for increasing [Ca2+]i, and bound with high affinity (18 nM). In addition, the antagonists PTH(7-34) and TIP(7-39) bound with 10- to 49-fold lower affinity to the rat receptor. We investigated the molecular basis of differential PTH and antagonist interaction with human and rat PTH2 receptors by using chimeric human/rat PTH2 receptors. PTH cAMP-signaling efficacy (Emax) was determined by extracellular loop (EL) 1 and a region including EL2 and EL3. The N-terminal domain determined PTH binding selectivity at the inactive receptor state. Multiple regions throughout the receptor are required for the PTH-PTH2 receptor complex to adopt a high-affinity active state: inserting the rat receptor's N-terminal domain, EL1 or EL2/3, into the human receptor increased PTH's EC50 and reciprocal exchanges did not reduce EC50. This suggests the global receptor conformation prevents the rat receptor from adopting a high-affinity state when in complex with PTH. N-terminal ligand truncation, producing the antagonists PTH(7-34) and TIP(7-39), altered ligand interaction with the membrane-embedded domain of the receptor, eliminating EL2/3 as a specificity determinant and lowering binding affinity. These insights should contribute to the development of a high-affinity PTH2 receptor antagonist, for investigating the receptor's physiological role.\",\n",

We then investigated whether glycocalicin could promote factor XI activation by thrombin, another GP Ibalpha ligand. In the presence of high molecular weight kininogen (45 nm), Zn(2+) and Ca(2+) ions, thrombin activated factor XI in the presence of glycocalicin at rates comparable with those seen in the presence of dextran sulfate (1 microg/ml). With higher high molecular weight kininogen concentrations (360 nm), the rate of thrombin-catalyzed factor XI activation in the presence of glycocalicin was comparable with that on activated platelets.

Multistart minimization and Monte Carlo minimization docking of IFN-alpha 2 onto ifnar2 converged to a well-defined average structure, with the five distance constraints being satisfied.

       "  'Abstract': \"Molecular analysis of CCR5, the cardinal coreceptor for HIV-1 infection, has implicated the N-terminal extracellular domain (N-ter) and regions vicinal to the second extracellular loop (ECL2) in this activity. It was shown that residues in the N-ter are necessary for binding of the physiologic ligands, RANTES (CCL5) and MIP-1 alpha (CCL3). vMIP-II, encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, is a high affinity CCR5 antagonist, but lacks efficacy as a coreceptor inhibitor. Therefore, we compared the mechanism for engagement by vMIP-II of CCR5 to its interaction with physiologic ligands. RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and vMIP-II bound CCR5 at high affinity, but demonstrated partial cross-competition. Characterization of 15 CCR5 alanine scanning mutants of charged extracellular amino acids revealed that alteration of acidic residues in the distal N-ter abrogated binding of RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and vMIP-II. Whereas mutation of residues in ECL2 of CCR5 dramatically reduced the binding of RANTES and MIP-1 alpha and their ability to induce signaling, interaction with vMIP-II was not altered by any mutation in the exoloops of the receptor. Paradoxically, monoclonal antibodies to N-ter epitopes did not block chemokine binding, but those mapped to ECL2 were effective inhibitors. A CCR5 chimera with the distal N-ter residues of CXCR2 bound MIP-1 alpha and vMIP-II with an affinity similar to that of the wild-type receptor. Engagement of CCR5 by vMIP-II, but not RANTES or MIP-1 alpha blocked the binding of monoclonal antibodies to the receptor, providing additional evidence for a distinct mechanism for viral chemokine binding. Analysis of the coreceptor activity of randomly generated mouse-human CCR5 chimeras implicated residues in ECL2 between H173 and V197 in this function. RANTES, but not vMIP-II blocked CCR5 M-tropic coreceptor activity in the fusion assay. The insensitivity of vMIP-II binding to mutations in ECL2 provides a potential rationale to its inefficiency as an antagonist of CCR5 coreceptor activity. These findings suggest that the molecular anatomy of CCR5 binding plays a critical role in antagonism of coreceptor activity.\",\n",

Both plasma-derived C4BP and recombinant C4BP consisting of only its alpha-chains (rC4BPalpha) bound efficiently to immobilized LRP, as determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Complementary, two distinct fragments of LRP, i.e. clusters II and IV, both associated to immobilized rC4BPalpha, and binding could be inhibited by the LRP antagonist receptor-associated protein. Further analysis showed that association of rC4BPalpha to LRP was inhibited by heparin or by anti-C4BP antibody RU-3B9, which recognizes the heparin-binding region of the C4BP alpha-chains. In cellular degradation experiments, LRP-expressing fibroblasts effectively degraded (125)I-labeled rC4BPalpha, whereas their LRP-deficient counterparts displayed a 4-fold diminished capacity of degrading (125)I-rC4BPalpha. Finally, initial clearance of C4BP in mice was significantly delayed upon co-injection with receptor-associated protein. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the alpha-chains of C4BP comprise a binding site for LRP.

IL-24 binding to either its endogenous receptors on human keratinocytes or to ectopically expressed receptors on baby hamster kidney cells leads to activation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for IL-24 being the fourth member of IL-10 family of cytokines to which their specific receptors have been identified.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Asthma is a common respiratory disease that is characterized by variable airways obstruction caused by acute and chronic bronchial inflammation; associated phenotypes include bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), elevated total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and skin tests positive to common allergens. Binding of interleukin-13 (IL13) or interleukin-4 (IL4) to the IL4 receptor (IL4R) induces the initial response for Th2 lymphocyte polarization. Both IL13 and IL4 are produced by Th2 cells and are capable of inducing isotype class-switching of B-cells to produce IgE after allergen exposure. These cytokines also share a common receptor component, IL4R alpha. We have investigated five IL4RA single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a population of Dutch families ascertained through a proband with asthma. By considering the probands and their spouses as an unrelated sample, we observed significant associations of atopy and asthma-related phenotypes with several IL4RA polymorphisms, including S478P and total serum IgE levels (P=.0007). A significant gene-gene interaction between S478P in IL4RA and the -1111 promoter variation in IL13, previously shown to be associated with BHR (P=.003), was detected. Individuals with the risk genotype for both genes were at almost five times greater risk for the development of asthma compared to individuals with both non-risk genotypes (P=.0004). These data suggest that variations in IL4RA contribute to elevated total serum IgE levels, and interaction between IL4RA and IL13 markedly increases an individual's susceptibility to asthma.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Uniquely for the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases, the EphB6 receptor is catalytically inactive due to the alteration of several critical residues in its kinase domain. This has cast doubt upon its ability to participate in cytoplasmic signaling events. We show here that despite its lack of kinase activity, EphB6 undergoes inducible tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation with the Eph-B receptor subfamily ligand ephrin-B1. We also demonstrate, for the first time, evidence of cross-talk between Eph receptors. Overexpression of a catalytically active member of the Eph-B subfamily, EphB1, resulted in increased EphB6 phosphorylation. EphB1-induced EphB6 phosphorylation was ligand-dependent and required the functional catalytic activity of EphB1. EphB1 not only transphosphorylated EphB6, but together they also formed a stable hetero-complex. In addition, we identify the proto-oncogene c-Cbl as an EphB6-binding protein. Although EphB6-Cbl association appeared to be constitutive, Cbl required a functional phosphotyrosine binding domain in order to bind the receptor, whereas its RING finger motif ubiquitin-transfer domain was not necessary. Our findings demonstrate that EphB6 is an actively signaling receptor that undergoes transphosphorylation upon ligand binding and that can initiate specific cytoplasmic signaling events.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Two G protein-coupled neurotensin (NT) receptors, termed NTR1 and NTR2, have been identified so far. In contrast to the NTR1, which has been extensively studied, little is known about the pharmacological and biological properties of the NTR2. In the course of characterizing NT analogs that exhibited binding selectivity for the NTR2, we discovered that this receptor constitutively activated inositol phosphate (IP) production. Here, we report on the constitutive activity of the human NTR2 (hNTR2) transfected in COS cells and on compounds that exhibit agonism, inverse agonism, and neutral antagonism at this receptor. IP levels increased linearly with time, whereas they remained constant in mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, IP production was proportional to the amount of hNTR2 present at the cell membrane. SR 48692, a nonpeptide antagonist of the NTR1, stimulated IP production, whereas levocabastine, a nonpeptide histamine H1 antagonist that binds the NTR2 but not the NTR1, behaved as a weak partial inverse agonist. NT analogs modified at position 11 of the NT molecule, in particular by the introduction of bulky aromatic D amino acids, exhibited binding selectivity at the hNTR2 and also behaved as partial inverse agonists, reversing constitutive IP production up to 50%. Finally, NT barely affected constitutive IP production but antagonized the effects of both agonist and inverse agonist compounds, thus behaving as a neutral antagonist. The unique pharmacological profile of the hNTR2 is discussed in the light of its sequence similarity with the NTR1 and the known binding site topology of NT and SR 48692 in the NTR1.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) plays an important role in modulation of the innate immune system of the lung. Peptidoglycan (PGN), a cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, is known to elicit excessive proinflammatory cytokine production from immune cells. In this study we investigated whether SP-A interacts with PGN and alters PGN-elicited cellular responses. Binding studies demonstrate that PGN is not a ligand for SP-A. However, SP-A significantly reduced PGN-elicited tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion by U937 cells and rat alveolar macrophages. The inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha secretion was dependent upon SP-A concentrations in physiological range. Coincubation of SP-A and PGN with human embryonic kidney 293 cells that had been transiently transfected with the cDNA of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), a cell signaling receptor for PGN, significantly attenuated PGN-induced nuclear factor-kappaB activity. SP-A directly bound to a soluble form of the recombinant extracellular TLR2 domain (sTLR2). Coincubation of sTLR2 with SP-A significantly reduced the binding of sTLR2 to PGN. These results indicate that the direct interaction of SP-A with TLR2 alters PGN-induced cell signaling. We propose that SP-A modulates inflammatory responses against the bacterial components by interactions with pattern-recognition receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The interaction of lymphocytes with other cells is critical for normal immune surveillance and response. MDC-L (ADAM 28), a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) protein family, is expressed on the surface of human lymphocytes. ADAMs possess a disintegrin-like domain similar in sequence to small non-enzymatic snake venom peptides that act as integrin antagonists. We report here that the disintegrin domain of MDC-L is recognized by the leukocyte integrin alpha(4)beta(1). Recombinant Fc fusion proteins possessing the disintegrin domain of MDC-L supported adhesion of the T-lymphoma cell line, Jurkat, in a concentration- and divalent cation-dependent manner. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the disintegrin domain of MDC-L was inhibited by an anti-MDC-L monoclonal antibody (mAb), Dis1-1. The epitope for mAb Dis1-1 was localized within 59 residues of the disintegrin domain. Recombinant expression of this 59-residue fragment of the disintegrin domain also supported cell adhesion. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the MDC-L disintegrin domain was specifically inhibited by anti-alpha(4) and anti-beta(1) function-blocking mAbs. Furthermore, adhesion of various cell lines to MDC-L correlated with expression of the integrin alpha(4)-subunit. Transfected K562 cells expressing alpha(4)beta(1) adhered to the disintegrin domain in contrast to non-transfected K562 cells. We further investigated the binding of recombinant MDC-L disintegrin domain (rDis-Fc) in solution. The rDis-Fc was found to bind to Jurkat cells in solution in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner. Both adhesion and solution binding of rDis-Fc was inhibited by the alpha(4)beta(1) ligand mimetic CS-1 peptide. Additionally, recognition of the MDC-L disintegrin domain required \"activation\" of lymphocyte beta(1) integrins. The interaction of MDC-L with alpha(4)beta(1) may potentially regulate metalloprotease function by targeting or sequestering the active protease on the cell surface. These results suggest a potential role for the lymphocyte ADAM, MDC-L, in the interaction of lymphocytes with alpha(4)beta(1)-expressing leukocytes.',\n",

To understand how structural variations of the antagonistic peptide effect pharmacodynamic properties, binding affinities and antagonistic potencies toward the human and rat GnRH receptor were determined. Whereas large substituents in position 6 of linear peptides are compatible with high binding affinity (K(D) < 0.5 nM), all cyclized peptides except the cyclo[3-10] analog D-52391 depicted low binding affinity (K(D) > 10 nM). Binding affinity and antagonistic potency in vitro correlated for all peptides and surprisingly no discrimination between human and rat receptor proteins was observed. Since receptor residues W(101) and N(102) are involved in agonist and antagonist binding, equally potent but structurally different antagonists were tested for binding to the respective W(101)A and N(102)A mutants. In contrast to linear decapeptides, residues N(102) and W(101) are not involved in binding of D-23938 and W(101) is the critical residue for D-52391 binding. We conclude that although equally potent, peptidic GnRH receptor antagonists do have distinct interactions within the ligand binding pocket. Finally, selected antagonists were tested for testosterone suppression in male rats. The duration of testosterone suppression below castration levels differed largely from 1 day for Ganirelix to 27 days for D-23487. Systemic availability became evident as the most important parameter for in vivo efficacy.',\n",

The second one was the -Leu131-Asp132-Arg133- moiety, localized 12 residues upstream from the COOH-terminal. The second binding triggered the chemotactic response. The first binding would have a role in achieving a high-binding affinity between the ligand and receptor.

There was no significant difference in eliciting Ca(2+) flux and chemotaxis among the variants with the exception of LD78beta(T9A) showing a substantially reduced activity. The comparative order for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication inhibition was: LD78beta(P8A) > LD78beta(D6A) > LD78beta(WT), LD78beta(L3A) > LD78beta(T7A), LD78beta(P2A) > LD78beta(T9A). In binding inhibition assays of LD78beta variants using 2D7 monoclonal antibody and (125)I-labeled macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, the comparative order was: LD78beta(P8A), LD78beta(D6A) > LD78beta(WT) > LD78beta(L3A) > LD78beta(T7A) > LD78beta(T9A), LD78betaP2A). The order for CCR5 down-regulation induction was comparable to that for binding inhibition. The present data suggest that Pro-2, Asp-6, Pro-8, and Thr-9 are critical for LD78beta binding to CCR5 and HIV-1 replication inhibition, and that LD78beta binding to CCR5, regardless of affinity, is sufficient for the initial signal transduction of LD78beta, whereas the greater anti-HIV-1 activity requires the greater magnitude of binding. The data also suggest that LD78beta variants with appropriate amino acid substitution(s) such as LD78beta(D6A) and LD78beta(P8A) may represent effective chemokine-based anti-HIV-1 therapeutics while preserving LD78beta-CCR5 interactions.',\n",

To further characterize the interactions between Dkk and LRP proteins, conditioned media containing individually conserved cysteine-rich domains of Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 were prepared. Although full-length Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 and the second cysteine-rich domains of both Dkk molecules inhibited Wnt-3a-induced activation of lymphoid enhancing factor (LEF)-1, a downstream target of the canonical pathway, we found that the second cysteine-rich domain of Dkk-2 (Dkk-2C2) was able to stimulate the canonical pathway when LRP-6 was ectopically expressed in NIH3T3 cells. This effect of Dkk-2C2 could be blocked by a monoclonal antibody specific to the second YWTD repeat domain of LRP-5/6, suggesting that Dkk-2C2 acts via LRP-6. We also showed that while both Axin and the DIX domain of Dishevelled (Dvl) could inhibit Dkk-2C2-induced activation of LEF-1, the DEP domain of Dvl, which inhibited Wnt-induced activation of LEF-1, failed to inhibit the activation of LEF-1 by Dkk-2C2 or by an activated form of LRP-5, LRPC2. In addition, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, a potent inhibitor for both Dvl and Wnt, also failed to inhibit LRPC2 or Dkk-2C2. Furthermore, knocking-down the expression of Dvl molecules by short interfering RNAs specific to Dvl inhibited Wnt-induced, but not LRPC2-induced, activation of LEF-1. All the evidence indicates that Dkk-2C2 signals through LRP proteins, which does not require Dvl, while Wnt protein may employ both Dvl, presumably through Fz, and LRP to achieve more efficient signal transduction.',\n",

The cysteine-rich C-terminal domain of this protein, corresponding to AGRP(87-132), contains five disulfide bonds and exhibits receptor binding affinity and antagonism equivalent to that of the full-length protein. The three-dimensional structure of this domain has been determined by 1H NMR at 800 MHz. The first 34 residues of AGRP(87-132) are well-ordered and contain a three-stranded antiparallel beta sheet, where the last two strands form a beta hairpin. The relative spatial positioning of the disulfide cross-links demonstrates that the ordered region of AGRP(87-132) adopts the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) fold previously identified for numerous invertebrate toxins. Interestingly, this may be the first example of a mammalian protein assigned to the ICK superfamily. The hairpin's turn region presents a triplet of residues (Arg-Phe-Phe) known to be essential for melanocortin receptor binding. The structure also suggests that AGRP possesses an additional melanocortin-receptor contact region within a loop formed by the first 16 residues of its C-terminal domain. This specific region shows little sequence homology to the corresponding region of the agouti protein, which is an MC1R antagonist involved in pigmentation. Consideration of these sequence differences, along with recent experiments on mutant and chimeric melanocortin receptors, allows us to postulate that this loop in the first 16 residues of its C-terminal domain confers AGRP's distinct selectivity for MC3R and MC4R.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF are hematopoietic cytokines that are key mediators of the allergic inflammatory response. The receptors for these three cytokines consist of a cytokine-specific alpha (Ralpha) chain and a shared common beta (betac) chain. Herein, we demonstrate that agonistic ligation of these receptor subunits rapidly induces proteasomal degradation of the betac, but not the Ralpha, cytoplasmic domain, resulting in termination of signal transduction and yielding a truncated betac isoform ligated to the Ralpha subunit. Proteasomal degradation of the betac cytoplasmic domain was also a prerequisite for endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the ligated receptor subunits. Moreover, proteasome-dependent termination of signaling induced by one betac-engaging cytokine resulted in cellular desensitization to signal transduction by subsequent stimulation with another betac-engaging cytokine. These data provide the first evidence for ligand-dependent proteasomal degradation of the betac cytoplasmic domain, and they establish a novel mechanism for heterotypic desensitization of shared cytokine receptor signaling.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'It is well established that integrin alpha 4 beta 1 binds to the vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and fibronectin and plays an important role in signal transduction. Blocking the binding of VCAM to alpha 4 beta 1 is thought to be a way of controlling a number of disease processes. To better understand how various inhibitors might block the interaction of VCAM and fibronectin with alpha 4 beta 1, we began constructing a structure model for the integrin alpha 4 beta 1 complex. As the first step, we have built a homology model of the beta 1 subunit based on the I domain of the integrin CD11B subunit. The model, including a bound Mg(2+) ion, was optimized through a specially designed relaxation scheme involving restrained minimization and dynamics steps. The native ligand VCAM and two highly active small molecules (TBC772 and TBC3486) shown to inhibit binding of CS-1 and VCAM to alpha 4 beta 1 were docked into the active site of the refined model. Results from the binding analysis fit well with a pharmacophore model that was independently derived from active analog studies. A critical examination of residues in the binding site and analysis of docked ligands that are both potent and selective led to the proposal of a mechanism for beta 1/beta 7 ligand binding selectivity.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Previously we reported that type V collagen synthesized by Schwann cells inhibits the outgrowth of axons from rat embryo dorsal root ganglion neurons but promotes Schwann cell migration (Chernousov, M. A., Stahl, R. C., and Carey, D. J. (2001) J. Neurosci. 21, 6125-6135). Analysis of Schwann cell adhesion and spreading on dishes coated with various type V collagen domains revealed that Schwann cells adhered effectively only to the non-collagenous N-terminal domain (NTD) of the alpha4(V) collagen chain. Schwann cell adhesion to alpha4(V)-NTD induced actin cytoskeleton assembly, tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of the Erk1/Erk2 protein kinases. Adhesion to alpha4(V)-NTD is cell type-specific because rat fibroblasts failed to adhere to dishes coated with this polypeptide. Schwann cell adhesion and spreading on alpha4(V)-NTD was strongly inhibited by soluble heparin (IC(50) approximately 30 ng/ml) but not by chondroitin sulfate. Analysis of the heparin binding activities of a series of recombinant alpha4(V)-NTD fragments and deletion mutants identified a highly basic region (not present in other type V collagen NTD) as the site responsible for high affinity heparin binding. Schwann cells adhered poorly to dishes coated with alpha4(V)-NTD that lacked the heparin binding site and failed to spread or assemble organized actin-cytoskeletal structures. Soluble alpha4(V)-NTD polypeptide that contained the heparin binding site inhibited spreading of Schwann cells on dishes coated with alpha4(V)-NTD. Affinity chromatography of Schwann cell detergent extracts on a column of immobilized alpha4(V)-NTD resulted in the isolation of syndecan-3, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Together, these results suggest that Schwann cells bind to collagen type V via syndecan-3-dependent binding to a novel high affinity heparin binding site in the alpha4(V)-NTD.',\n",

The extracellular domain of CD30 is shed from cells and soluble CD30 levels are elevated in certain disease states. Soluble CD30 may bind to its ligand, CD153, with high affinity and block its interaction with membrane-bound CD30. We have generated soluble recombinant forms of CD30 and CD153 in order to characterize their interaction and assess their biological activity. Soluble trimeric CD153 bound to membrane-anchored CD30 with a relatively high affinity (K(D)=23 nM) and was effective in triggering cell death and TNF-alpha production in the presence of cross-linking antibodies. The affinity and kinetics of the interaction between soluble CD30 and CD153 were determined using the BIAcore biosensor. In contrast to other members of the TNF receptor superfamily, soluble monomeric CD30 bound to its ligand with high affinity (K(D)=4.5 nM) and prevented the interaction of cellular CD153 with immobilized CD30. Furthermore, soluble CD30 blocked cell death signals generated by cell surface-expressed CD30 effectively. These data suggest that soluble CD30 may have biological functions in vivo.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The substantial variations in the responses of cells to the anaphylatoxin C5a and its desarginated form, C5adR(74), suggest that more than one type of cell surface receptor for these ligands might exist. However, only a single receptor for C5a and C5adR(74), CD88, has been characterized to date. Here we report that the orphan receptor C5L2/gpr77, which shares 35% amino acid identity with CD88, binds C5a with high affinity but has a 10-fold higher affinity for C5adR(74) than CD88. C5L2 also has a moderate affinity for anaphylatoxin C3a, but cross-competition studies suggest that C3a binds to a distinct site from C5a. C4a was able to displace C3a, suggesting that C5L2, like the C3a receptor, may have a low binding affinity for this anaphylatoxin. Unlike CD88 and C3a receptor, C5L2 transfected into RBL-2H3 cells does not support degranulation or increases in intracellular [Ca(2+)] and is not rapidly internalized in response to ligand binding. However, ligation of C5L2 by anaphylatoxin did potentiate the degranulation response to cross-linkage of the high affinity IgE receptor by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. These results suggest that C5L2 is an anaphylatoxin-binding protein with unique ligand binding and signaling properties.',\n",

Each Eph receptor binds an ephrin ligand through an expansive dimerization interface dominated by the insertion of an extended ephrin loop into a channel at the surface of the receptor. Two Eph-Ephrin dimers then join to form a tetramer, in which each ligand interacts with two receptors and each receptor interacts with two ligands. The Eph and ephrin molecules are precisely positioned and orientated in these complexes, promoting higher-order clustering and the initiation of bidirectional signalling.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The predicted second extracellular loop domain of the motilin receptor is of particular interest because it is a region that is quite distinct from the analogous regions in other family members that are most closely related and because the initial report of the photoaffinity labeling of a domain of this receptor included this region (Coulie, B. J., Matsuura, B., Dong, M., Hadac, E. M., Pinon, D. I., Feighner, S. D., Howard, A. D., and Miller, L. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 35518-35522). In the current work, motilin receptor constructs were prepared that included sequential deletions ranging from single residues to twelve amino acid segments throughout this 67 amino acid domain. Each construct was expressed in COS cells and characterized for motilin radioligand binding and motilin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses. The only segments that had negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity included deletion constructs DeltaCys(235), Delta179-182, and Delta241-246. Cys(235) is likely involved in the highly conserved and functionally important disulfide bond linking the first and second loops of G protein-coupled receptors. Alanine replacements for each of the amino acid residues in the other two segments revealed that the perimembranous residues at both ends of this loop, Val(179) and Leu(245) and Arg(246), were responsible for the negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity. Of note, these mutants responded normally to the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin. These data support important functional roles for both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal perimembranous regions of the second loop for responses to the natural agonist peptide, while supporting independent determinants for action of a non-peptidyl agonist ligand.',\n",

Five melanocortin receptors have been identified, of which the melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R) has the most widespread distribution. This subtype is found in the brain, and at numerous peripheral sites including the skin where it is expressed in the sebaceous glands. The purpose of this study was to identify the peptide that functions as a natural ligand at the MC5R in the skin. alpha-MSH, ACTH1-39, ACTH1-17, ACTH1-10, and ACTH4-10 all increased the production of cAMP in HEK293 cells transfected with the mouse MC5R. alpha-MSH and ACTH1-17 were the most potent in this respect. In addition, all peptides stimulated a rapid and transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i), and, ACTH1-10 was the most potent. The increases in [Ca(2+)](i) were of intracellular origin, but not associated with inositol phosphate production. The elevations in [Ca(2+)](i) were reduced by ruthenium red and procaine and it is therefore possible that they were mediated via ryanodine receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'IL4-BP, the extracellular binding domain of the IL-4 receptor alpha chain, contains a high-affinity binding epitope for IL-4 (K(D) 150 pM). Previous results on the crystal structure of the IL-4/IL4-BP complex and on the functional epitope of IL-4 suggested that this contact comprises a mosaic of two binding clusters. The present mutational analysis of IL4-BP supports this view and demonstrates that the energetically most important group is the receptor carboxylate group of D72 forming an ion pair with IL-4 R88 in cluster II. The second main receptor determinant is the hydroxyl group of Y183 forming a hydrogen bond with IL-4 E9 in cluster I. The latter is engaged in additional hydrogen bonds with Y13 and also in van der Waals contacts with Y127. Receptor residue D72 as well as Y183 are each surrounded by a shell of hydrophobic groups from residues that upon mutation lead to smaller decreases in binding affinity. Analysis of IL4-BP double mutants showed that receptor side-chains within one cluster but not those of different clusters cooperate. Interaction analysis of IL-4 and IL4-BP single mutants also revealed additivity in binding of side-chains between clusters and cooperativity within each cluster I or II.These results show that the high-affinity IL-4/IL4-BP contact is constituted by two independent binding units, each containing a central polar or charged side-chain surrounded by hydrophobic groups (avocado cluster).',\n",

Similar to SP (K(i)=0.13 nM), HEK-1 inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner and with high affinity [(3)H]-substance P (SP) binding to human NK(1) receptor (K(i)=0.175 nM) while its affinity for [(125)I]-neurokinin A (NKA) binding at human NK(2) receptor was markedly lower (K(i)=560 nM). 3. In isolated bioassays HEK-1 was a full agonist at tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptors. In the rat urinary bladder (RUB) HEK-1 was about 3 fold less potent than SP. In the rabbit pulmonary artery (RPA) HEK-1 and in the guinea-pig ileum (GPI), HEK-1 was about 500 fold less potent than NKA and NKB, respectively. 4. The responses to HEK-1 were antagonized by GR 82334 in RUB (pK(B)=5.6+/-0.07), by nepadutant in RPA (pK(B)=8.6+/-0.04) and by SR 142801 in GPI (pK(B)=9.0+/-0.2) with apparent affinities comparable to that measured against tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptor-selective agonists, respectively. 5. Intravenous HEK-1 produced dose-related decrease of blood pressure in anaesthetized guinea-pigs (ED(50)=0.1 nmol kg(-1)) and salivary secretion in anaesthetized rats (ED(50)=6 nmol kg(-1)) with potencies similar to that of SP. All these effects were blocked by the selective tachykinin NK(1) receptor antagonist, SR 140333. 6. We conclude that HEK-1 is a full agonist at tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptors, possesses a remarkable selectivity for NK(1) as compared to NK(2) or NK(3) receptors and acts in vivo experiments with potency similar to that of SP.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cooperative action of inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules orchestrates eosinophil recruitment during allergic inflammation in the airways. This study investigated the mechanisms involved in increasing eosinophil adhesion to human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) following priming and activation of eosinophils with TNF-alpha and complement protein C5a, respectively. Under primed conditions, eosinophil adhesion increased 3-fold from basal (16%), and the effect was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the increase following stimulation with C5a alone (2-fold). Eosinophil contact with HBEC was essential for priming. In contrast to C5a, adhesion of eotaxin-stimulated eosinophils to HBEC was not primed with TNF-alpha nor IL-5, a known eosinophil-priming agent. Priming caused activation of alpha(M)beta(2) integrin; mAb against either the common beta(2) integrin subunit or its ICAM-1 ligand reduced the primed component of adhesion. Using mAbs against beta(1) or alpha(5), but not alpha(4) integrin subunit, together with anti-beta(2) integrin mAb, reduced stimulated adhesion to basal levels. Cross-linking alpha(5)beta(1) integrin increased alpha(M)beta(2) integrin-dependent adhesion of eosinophils. There are no known adhesion molecule ligands of alpha(5)beta(1) integrin expressed on HBEC; however, fibronectin, the major matrix protein ligand for alpha(5)beta(1) integrin, was detected in association with HBEC monolayers. A mAb against fibronectin, in combination with anti-beta(2) integrin mAb, reduced adhesion to basal levels. In conclusion, alpha(5)beta(1) integrin may provide a contact-dependent costimulus for eosinophil priming that, together with TNF-alpha, potentiated C5a activation of alpha(M)beta(2) integrin and increased eosinophil adhesion to ICAM-1. Fibronectin, associated with HBEC, may act as a ligand for alpha(5)beta(1) integrin. Dual regulation of eosinophil priming may prevent inappropriate activation of eosinophils in the circulation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Receptor recycling plays a key role in the modulation of cellular responses to extracellular signals. The purpose of this work was to identify residues in G-protein coupled neurotensin receptors that are directly involved in recycling. Both the high affinity receptor-1 (NTR1) and the levocabastine-sensitive NTR2 are internalized after neurotensin binding. Here, we show that only the mouse NTR2 recycled to the plasma membrane, whereas the rat NTR1 and the human NTR2 did not. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that tyrosine 237 in the third intracellular loop is crucial for recycling of the mouse NTR2. We show that the mouse NTR2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by NT. This phosphorylation is essential for receptor recycling since the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocks this process. The absence of recycling observed with the human NTR2 could be completely explained by the presence of a cysteine instead of a tyrosine in position 237. Indeed, substitution of this cysteine by a tyrosine gave a mutant receptor that has acquired the ability to recycle to the cell surface after neurotensin-induced internalization. This work demonstrates that a single tyrosine residue in the third intracellular loop of a G-protein-coupled receptor is responsible for receptor phosphorylation and represents an essential structural element for receptor recycling.',\n",

Furthermore, the metabolic stability of the large peptides, when exposed to HT29 cells, was compared to that of NT and NN. Both large NT and large NN were able to bind to and activate hNTS1 with potencies that were approximately 10 times lower than that of their small counterpart.

Y-receptor subtype ligand binding data are used in conjunction with structural data to develop a model for receptor subtype selective agonists.

       "  'Abstract': 'CD44 is a facultative proteoglycan implicated in cell adhesion and trafficking, as well as in tumor survival and progression. We demonstrate here that CD44 heparan sulfate proteoglycan (CD44HSPG) recruits proteolytically active matrix metalloproteinase 7 (matrilysin, MMP-7) and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor precursor (pro-HB-EGF) to form a complex on the surface of tumor cell lines, postpartum uterine and lactating mammary gland epithelium, and uterine smooth muscle. The HB-EGF precursor within this complex is processed by MMP-7, and the resulting mature HB-EGF engages and activates its receptor, ErbB4, leading to, among other events, cell survival. In CD44(-/-) mice, postpartum uterine involution is accelerated and maintenance of lactation is impaired. In both uterine and mammary epithelia of these mice, MMP-7 localization is altered and pro-HB-EGF processing as well as ErbB4 activation are decreased. Our observations provide a mechanism for the assembly and function of a cell surface complex composed of CD44HSPG, MMP 7, HB-EGF, and ErbB4 that may play an important role in the regulation of physiological tissue remodeling.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play a crucial role in growth regulation by assembling signaling complexes and presenting growth factors to their cognate receptors. Within the immune system, expression of the HSPG syndecan-1 (CD138) is characteristic of terminally differentiated B cells, ie, plasma cells, and their malignant counterpart, multiple myeloma (MM). This study explored the hypothesis that syndecan-1 might promote growth factor signaling and tumor growth in MM. For this purpose, the interaction was studied between syndecan-1 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a putative paracrine and autocrine regulator of MM growth. The study demonstrates that syndecan-1 is capable of binding HGF and that this growth factor is indeed a potent stimulator of MM survival and proliferation. Importantly, the interaction of HGF with heparan sulfate moieties on syndecan-1 strongly promotes HGF-mediated signaling, resulting in enhanced activation of Met, the receptor tyrosine kinase for HGF. Moreover, HGF binding to syndecan-1 promotes activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B and RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, signaling routes that have been implicated in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation, respectively. These results identify syndecan-1 as a functional coreceptor for HGF that promotes HGF/Met signaling in MM cells, thus suggesting a novel function for syndecan-1 in MM tumorigenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a member of the interleukin-6 superfamily, and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are potent hypertrophic factors in cardiomyocytes. Although CT-1 and ET-1 gene expression in the heart is upregulated in experimental heart failure, their role in the activation of the cardiac fibroblast is unknown. This study was designed to identify the presence and action of CT-1 and its receptor complex, glycoprotein130 (gp130) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor, on cardiac fibroblast growth in cultured adult canine cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, we investigated the interaction between CT-1/gp130/LIF receptor and ET-1/endothelin type A (ET(A)) receptor axis. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the indirect immunoperoxidase method, while we assessed the cell cycle of cardiac fibroblasts by flow cytometry, DNA synthesis by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, and collagen synthesis by [(3)H]proline incorporation, respectively. CT-1 and gp130/LIF receptor were widely present in the cytoplasm of the cardiac fibroblasts. Exogenous CT-1 markedly stimulated [(3)H]thymidine and [(3)H]proline incorporations (P<0.01), with accumulation of cells in the S phase. Blockade of gp130 or LIF receptor inhibited basal growth as well as CT-1- or ET-1-stimulated cardiac fibroblast growth. The specific ET(A) receptor antagonist, BQ123, significantly inhibited CT-1-stimulated DNA synthesis. This study demonstrates that CT-1 and its receptors are present in cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, growth of these cells stimulated by endogenous and exogenous CT-1 requires gp130/LIF receptor as well as ET(A) receptor activation. We conclude that gp130/LIF receptor and ET(A) receptor activation are essential for cardiac fibroblast growth by CT-1 and that there is synergism with ET-1/ET(A) receptor axis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Human melanin-concentrating hormone (hMCH) is a nonselective natural ligand for the human melanin-concentrating hormone receptors: hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R. Similarly, the smaller peptide encompassing the disulfide ring and Arg(6) of hMCH, Ac-Arg(6)-cyclo(S-S)(Cys(7)-Met(8)-Leu(9)-Gly(10)-Arg(11)-Val(12)-Tyr(13)-Arg(14)-Pro(15)-Cys(16))-NH(2), Ac-hMCH(6-16)-NH(2), binds to and activates equally well both human MCH receptors present in the brain. To separate the physiological functions of hMCH-1R from those of hMCH-2R, new potent and hMCH-1R selective agonists are necessary. In the present study, analogs of Ac-hMCH(6-16)-NH(2) were prepared and tested in binding and functional assays on cells expressing the MCH receptors. In these peptides, Arg in position 6 was replaced with various d-amino acids and/or Gly in position 10 was substituted with various L-amino acids. Several of the new compounds turned out to be potent agonists at hMCH-1R with improved selectivity over hMCH-2R. For example, peptide 26 with d-Arg in place of L-Arg in position 6 and Asn in place of Gly in position 10, Ac-dArg(6)-cyclo(S-S)(Cys(7)-Met(8)-Leu(9)-Asn(10)-Arg(11)-Val(12)-Tyr(13)-Arg(14)-Pro(15)-Cys(16))-NH(2), was a potent hMCH-1R agonist (IC(50) = 0.5 nm, EC(50) = 47 nm) with more than 200-fold selectivity with respect to hMCH-2R. Apparently, these structural changes in positions 6 and 10 results in peptide conformations that allow for efficient interactions with hMCH-1R but are unfavorable for molecular recognition at hMCH-2R.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Alternative splicing of the fibronectin gene transcript gives rise to forms that include the EIIIA (or ED-A) segment. EIIIA-containing fibronectins are prominently expressed during embryogenesis and wound healing and appear to mediate changes in cell adhesion and gene expression. Nonetheless, integrins that bind the EIIIA segment have not been identified. We previously mapped the epitope for two function-blocking monoclonal antibodies to the C-C' loop region of the EIIIA segment (Liao, Y.-F., Wieder, K. G., Classen, J. M., and Van De Water, L. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 17876-17884). The sequence of this epitope ((39)PEDGIHELFP(48)) resembles the sequence within tenascin-C to which the integrin alpha(9)beta(1) binds. We now report that either integrin alpha(9)beta(1) or alpha(4)beta(1) can mediate cell adhesion to the EIIIA segment. Moreover, this interaction is blocked both by epitope-mapped EIIIA antibodies as well as by the respective anti-integrins. Deletion mutants of the EIIIA segment that include the C-C' loop and flanking sequence bind cells expressing either alpha(9)beta(1) or alpha(4)beta(1). Adhesion of alpha(4)beta(1)-containing MOLT-3 cells to the EIIIA segment stimulates phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase. Our observation that two integrins bind the EIIIA segment establishes a novel mechanism by which cell adhesion to fibronectin is regulated by alternative splicing.\",\n",

We have cloned a newly identified family of 'orphan' G protein--coupled receptors (GPCRs) and demonstrate that BAM22 and a number of its fragments bind to and activate these receptors with nanomolar affinities. This family of GPCRs is uniquely localized in the human and rat small sensory neuron, and we called this family the sensory neuron--specific G protein--coupled receptors (SNSRs). Receptors of the SNSR family are distinct from the traditional opioid receptors in their insensitivity to the classical opioid antagonist naloxone and poor activation by opioid ligands. The unique localization of SNSRs and their activation by proenkephalin A peptide fragments indicate a possible function for SNSRs in sensory neuron regulation and in the modulation of nociception.\",\n",

TGF-beta initiates receptor assembly by binding with high affinity to the type II receptor. Here, we present the 2.15 A crystal structure of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human TGF-beta type II receptor (ecTbetaR2) in complex with human TGF-beta3. ecTbetaR2 interacts with homodimeric TGF-beta3 by binding identical finger segments at opposite ends of the growth factor. Relative to the canonical 'closed' conformation previously observed in ligand structures across the superfamily, ecTbetaR2-bound TGF-beta3 shows an altered arrangement of its monomeric subunits, designated the 'open' conformation. The mode of TGF-beta3 binding shown by ecTbetaR2 is compatible with both ligand conformations. This, in addition to the predicted mode for TGF-beta binding to the type I receptor ectodomain (ecTbetaR1), suggests an assembly mechanism in which ecTbetaR1 and ecTbetaR2 bind at adjacent positions on the ligand surface and directly contact each other via protein--protein interactions.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) functions in the catabolism of numerous ligands including proteinases, proteinase inhibitor complexes, and lipoproteins. In the current study we provide evidence indicating an expanded role for LRP in modulating cellular signaling events. Our results show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB induces a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP cytoplasmic domain in a process dependent on PDGF receptor activation and c-Src family kinase activity. Other growth factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, were unable to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP. The basis for this selectivity may result from the ability of LRP to bind PDGFBB, because surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated that only PDGF, and not basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor-1, bound to purified LRP immobilized on a sensor chip. The use of LRP mini-receptor mutants as well as in vitro phosphorylation studies demonstrated that the tyrosine located within the second NPXY motif found in the LRP cytoplasmic domain is the primary site of tyrosine phosphorylation by Src and Src family kinases. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of LRPs cytoplasmic domain results in increased association of the adaptor protein Shc with LRP and that Shc recognizes the second NPXY motif within LRPs cytoplasmic domain. In the accompanying paper, Boucher et al. (Boucher, P., Liu, P. V., Gotthardt, M., Hiesberger, T., Anderson, R. G. W., and Herz, J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15507-15513) reveal that LRP is found in caveolae along with the PDGF receptor.

The collagen binding site of alpha2beta1 has been localized to the alpha2 von Willebrand Factor type A (VWFA) domain (A-domain or I-domain) and the residues responsible for the interaction with collagen have been mapped. We report a study of alpha2 VWFA domain in which residue E318, which lies outside the collagen binding site, is mutated to tryptophan, showing that this is a gain-of-function mutation. Recombinant alpha2-E318W VWFA domain showed elevated and specific binding to collagen I compared with the wild-type. Side chain hydrophobicity was important for the gain-of-function as elevated binding was seen with E318I and E318Y, but not with E318R. The E318W mutation had additional effects on VWFA domain properties as alpha2-E318W VWFA domain differed from the wild-type in its cation preferences for ligand binding and in binding to monoclonal antibody JA203, which bound at a site distal to E318. The gain-of-function effect was not restricted to binding to collagen I as alpha2-E318W also showed elevated binding to collagen IV, collagen I C-propeptide, laminin and E-cadherin. Binding to these ligands was inhibited by collagen peptide containing the GFOGER motif, indicating that these bound to the VWFA domain by a similar mechanism to collagen I.

Secreted human TIP39 is identical to the previously isolated bovine TIP39, whereas mouse TIP39 differs by four amino acids. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that TIP39, PTH, and PTHrP may have evolved from a common ancestor. Synthetic human and mouse TIP39 showed indistinguishable potencies [EC(50): 0.54 (human) vs. 0.74 nM (mouse)] at the human PTH2-receptor stably expressed in LLCPK(1) cells; furthermore, TIP-(9-39) was an inhibitor of cAMP accumulation stimulated by either [Tyr(34)]PTH(1-34)amide or human/bovine TIP39. In the mouse, an approximately 4.5-kb mRNA encoding TIP39 was identified by Northern blot analysis in testis and, less abundantly, in liver and kidney, whereas other tissues revealed additional smaller transcripts. In situ hybridizations revealed TIP39 expression in seminiferous tubuli and several brain regions, including nucleus ruber, nucleus centralis pontis, and nucleus subparafascicularis thalami.

Nevertheless, a major class of ligand(s) is present in the retinal basal lamina and glial endfeet, the potent native growth substrate for retinal axons. We demonstrate here that cPTPsigma is a heparin-binding protein and that its basal lamina ligands include the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) agrin and collagen XVIII. These molecules interact with high affinity with cPTPsigma in vitro, and this binding is totally dependent upon their heparan sulfate chains. Using molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis, a binding site for heparin and heparan sulfate was identified in the first immunoglobulin-like domain of cPTPsigma. HSPGs are therefore a novel class of heterotypic ligand for cPTPsigma, suggesting that cPTPsigma signaling in axons and growth cones is directly responsive to matrix-associated cues.',\n",

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments, however, failed to detect binding of ANGPTL3 to the Tie2 receptor. A molecular model of the FBN-like domain of ANGPTL3 was generated and predicted potential binding to integrins. This hypothesis was experimentally confirmed by the finding that recombinant ANGPTL3 bound to alpha(v)beta(3) and induced integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-dependent haptotactic endothelial cell adhesion and migration and stimulated signal transduction pathways characteristic for integrin activation, including phosphorylation of Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and focal adhesion kinase. When tested in the rat corneal assay, ANGPTL3 strongly induced angiogenesis with comparable magnitude as observed for vascular endothelial growth factor-A. Moreover, the C-terminal FBN-like domain alone was sufficient to induce endothelial cell adhesion and in vivo angiogenesis. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ANGPTL3 is the first member of the angiopoietin-like family of secreted factors binding to integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and suggest a possible role in the regulation of angiogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We previously described two mammalian secreted proteins, prokineticin 1 and prokineticin 2, that potently contract gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Prokineticin 1 has also been shown to promote angiogenesis by stimulating proliferation, migration, and fenestration of endocrine organ-derived endothelial cells. Here we report the cloning and characterization of two closely related G protein-coupled receptors as receptors for prokineticins. Expression of prokineticin receptors in heterologous systems shows that these receptors bind to and are activated by nanomolar concentrations of recombinant prokineticins. Activation of prokineticin receptors leads to mobilization of calcium, stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover, and activation of p44/p42 MAPK signaling pathways that are consistent with the effects of prokineticins on smooth muscle contraction and angiogenesis. mRNA expression analysis reveals that prokineticin receptors are expressed in gastrointestinal organs, endocrine glands, and other tissues.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The human interferon receptor (IFNAR) mediates the antiviral and antiproliferative activities of type I interferons (IFNs). This receptor is comprised of subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, the latter exhibiting nanomolar affinity for IFNs. Here the extracellular domain of IFNAR2 (IFNAR2-EC), a soluble 25 kDa IFN-binding polypeptide, and its complex with IFN-alpha 2 were studied using multidimensional NMR. IFNAR2-EC is comprised of two fibronectin-III (FN-III) domains connected by a helical hinge region. The deduced global fold was utilized to improve the alignment of IFNAR2-EC against structurally related receptors and to model its structure. A striking feature of IFNAR2-EC is the limited and localized deviations in chemical shifts exhibited upon ligand binding, observed for only 15% of its backbone (1)H and (15)N nuclei. Analysis of these deviations maps the IFN-alpha 2 binding site upon IFNAR2-EC to a contiguous surface on the N-terminal domain, including the S3-S4 loop (residues 44-53), the S5-S6 loop and S6 beta-strand (residues 74-82), and the S7 beta-strand and the hinge region (residues 95-105). The C-terminal domain contributes only marginally to ligand binding, and no change in the hypothesized interdomain interface is observed. The proposed binding domain encompasses all residues implicated by mutagenesis studies in IFN binding, and suggests adjacent residues cooperate in forming the binding surface. D(2)O-exchange experiments indicate that binding of IFN-alpha2 induces tightening of the N-terminal domain of IFNAR2-EC. This increase in receptor rigidity may play an important role in initiating the intracellular stage of the IFN signaling cascade.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Membrane guanylate cyclase C (GC-C) is the receptor for guanylin, uroguanylin, and heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) in the intestine. GC-C-deficient mice show resistance to STa in intestine but saluretic and diuretic effects of uroguanylin and STa are not disturbed. Here we describe the cellular effects of these peptides using immortalized human kidney epithelial (IHKE-1) cells with properties of the proximal tubule, analyzed with the slow-whole-cell patch clamp technique. Uroguanylin (10 or 100 nm) either hyperpolarized or depolarized membrane voltages (V(m)). Guanylin and STa (both 10 or 100 nm), as well as 8-Br-cGMP (100 microm), depolarized V(m). All peptide effects were absent in the presence of 1 mm Ba(2+). Uroguanylin and guanylin changed V(m) pH dependently. Pertussis toxin (1 microg/ml, 24 h) inhibited hyperpolarizations caused by uroguanylin. Depolarizations caused by guanylin and uroguanylin were blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (10 microm). All three peptides increased cellular cGMP. mRNA for GC-C was detected in IHKE-1 cells and in isolated human proximal tubules. In IHKE-1 cells GC-C was also detected by immunostaining. These findings suggest that GC-C is probably the receptor for guanylin and STa. For uroguanylin two distinct signaling pathways exist in IHKE-1 cells, one involves GC-C and cGMP as second messenger, the other is cGMP-independent and connected to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a potentiator of glucose-induced insulin secretion. PACAP binds to a PACAP-specific receptor (PAC1) and to VPAC receptors (VPAC1 and VPAC2), which share high affinity for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). In the present study, the molecular expression of PACAP receptor isoforms and the signaling pathways involved in the insulin secretory effect of PACAP were investigated in isolated rat and mouse pancreatic islets. mRNA encoding PAC1-short, -hop, and -very short variants, as well as VPAC1 and VPAC2, were expressed in pancreatic islets. PACAP and VIP were equipotent in potentiating glucose-induced insulin release. Both peptides were also equipotent in increasing cAMP production, but PACAP was more efficient than VIP. Unlike carbachol, PACAP and VIP had no effect on inositol phosphate production. In the PAC1-deficient mouse, the insulinotropic effect of PACAP was reduced, and its differential effect on cAMP production was abolished, whereas the effects of VIP remained unchanged. These results clearly show that the insulinotropic effect of PACAP involved both VPAC and PAC1. The PAC1 variants expressed in rat and mouse pancreatic islets seem to be coupled to adenylate cyclase but not to PLC.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Previously we have demonstrated that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K) signal-transduction pathway mediates platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis in fetal lung fibroblasts. In the present study we further investigated the signal-transduction pathway(s) that results in PDGF-BB-induced GAG synthesis. Over-expression of a soluble PDGF beta-receptor as well as a mutated form of the beta-receptor, unable to bind PI-3K, diminished GAG synthesis in fetal lung fibroblasts subsequent to PDGF-BB stimulation. The PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin blocked PDGF-BB-induced Akt activity as well as significantly diminishing PDGF-BB-mediated GAG synthesis. Expression of dominant-negative PI-3K also abrogated Akt activity and GAG synthesis. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative Akt abrogated endogenous Akt activity, Rab3D phosphorylation and GAG synthesis, whereas expression of constitutively activated Akt stimulated Rab3D phosphorylation and GAG synthesis in the absence of PDGF-BB. Over-expression of wild-type PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10) inhibited Akt activity and concomitantly attenuated GAG synthesis in fibroblasts stimulated with PDGF-BB. These data suggest that Akt is an integral protein involved in PDGF-BB-mediated GAG regulation in fetal lung fibroblasts.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Microglial cells represent the major immunocompetent element of the CNS and are activated by any type of brain injury or disease. A candidate for signaling neuronal injury to microglial cells is the CC chemokine ligand CCL21, given that damaged neurons express CCL21. Investigating microglia in acute slices and in culture, we demonstrate that a local application of CCL21 for 30 s triggered a Cl(-) conductance with lasted for tens of minutes. This response was sensitive to the Cl(-) channel blockers 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and 4-acetamide-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene, 2,2'-disulfonic acid. Moreover, CCL21 triggered a chemotaxis response, which was sensitive to Cl(-) channel blockers. In microglial cells cultured from CCR7 knockout mice, CCL21 produced the same type of Cl(-) current as well as a chemotaxis response. In contrast, in microglial cells from CXCR3 knockout mice, CCL21 triggered neither a Cl(-) conductance nor a chemotaxis response after CCL21 application. We conclude that the CCL21-induced Cl(-) current is a prerequisite for the chemotaxis response mediated by the activation of CXCR3 but not CCR7 receptors, indicating that in brain CCL21 acts via a different receptor system than in lymphoid organs.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cripto-1 (CR-1), an epidermal growth factor-CFC (EGF-CFC) family member, has a demonstrated role in embryogenesis and mammary gland development and is overexpressed in several human tumors. Recently, EGF-CFC proteins were implicated as essential signaling cofactors for Nodal, a transforming growth factor beta family member whose expression has previously been defined as embryo specific. To identify a receptor for CR-1, a human brain cDNA phage display library was screened using CR-1 protein as bait. Phage inserts with identity to ALK4, a type I serine/threonine kinase receptor for Activin, were identified. CR-1 binds to cell surface ALK4 expressed on mammalian epithelial cells in fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, as well as by coimmunoprecipitation. Nodal is coexpressed with mouse Cr-1 in the mammary gland, and CR-1 can phosphorylate the transcription factor Smad-2 in EpH-4 mammary epithelial cells only in the presence of Nodal and ALK4. In contrast, CR-1 stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT in these cells is independent of Nodal and ALK4, suggesting that CR-1 may modulate different signaling pathways to mediate its different functional roles.',\n",

TL1A induces NF-kappaB activation and apoptosis in DR3-expressing cell lines, while TR6-Fc protein antagonizes these signaling events. Interestingly, in T cells, TL1A acts as a costimulator that increases IL-2 responsiveness and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that interaction of TL1A with DR3 promotes T cell expansion during an immune response, whereas TR6 has an opposing effect.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Guanylyl cyclases (GC) exist as soluble and particulate, membrane-associated enzymes which catalyse the conversion of GTP to cGMP, an intracellular signalling molecule. Several membrane forms of the enzyme have been identified up to now. Some of them serve as receptors for the natriuretic peptides, a family of peptides which includes atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), three peptides known to play important roles in renal and cardiovascular physiology. These are transmembrane proteins composed of a single transmembrane domain, a variable extracellular natriuretic peptide-binding domain, and a more conserved intracellular kinase homology domain (KHD) and catalytic domain. GC-A, the receptor for ANP and BNP, also named natriuretic peptide receptor-A or -1 (NPR-A or NPR- 1), has been studied widely. Its mode of activation by peptide ligands and mechanisms of regulation serve as prototypes for understanding the function of other particulate GC. Activation of this enzyme by its ligand is a complex process requiring oligomerization, ligand binding, KHD phosphorylation and ATP binding. Gene knockout and genetic segregation studies have provided strong evidence for the importance of GC-A in the regulation of blood pressure and heart and renal functions. GC-B is the main receptor for CNP, the latter having a more paracrine role at the vascular and venous levels. The structure and regulation of GC-B is similar to that of GC-A. This chapter reviews the structure and roles of GC-A and GC-B in blood pressure regulation and cardiac and renal pathophysiology.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Type XIII collagen consists of a short N-terminal intracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a collagenous ectodomain, and it is found at many sites of cell adhesion. We report on the characterization of recombinant type XIII collagen. The shed ectodomain was purified from insect cell culture medium and shown to form 240-kDa trimers with a T(m) of 42 degrees C. Correct chain association into a triple-helical conformation was confirmed by limited pepsin digestion and CD spectroscopy. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy of the ectodomain revealed it to be a 150-nm rod with two flexible hinges separating 31-, 52-, and 68-nm portions. The rods represent the collagenous domains 1-3, and the hinges coincide with the non-collagenous domains 2 and 3. By using surface plasmon resonance analysis, the ectodomain showed interaction with immobilized fibronectin, nidogen-2, and perlecan with K(D) values in the nanomolar range. The binding sites of type XIII collagen for fibronectin were localized to the collagenous domains, whereas the binding activities for nidogen-2 and perlecan resided in the pepsin-sensitive portions of the ectodomain. Furthermore, the ectodomain bound significantly to heparin, which also inhibited shedding of the ectodomain in insect cell cultures. The results reveal that type XIII collagen is notably distinct in its structure compared with other cell-surface proteins, and the in vitro binding with fibronectin, heparin, and two basement membrane components is indicative of multiple cell-matrix interactions in which this ubiquitously expressed protein participates.',\n",

TGF-beta exists mainly in a latent state, and a major point of homeostatic control is the activation of TGF-beta.

Here, we show that SLC binds to alpha(v)beta8, an integrin expressed by normal epithelial and neuronal cells in vivo. This binding results in the membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP-dependent release of active TGF-beta, which leads to autocrine and paracrine effects on cell growth and matrix production.

The expression of chemokine receptors by intrinsic renal cells such as mesangial cells (MC) suggests an expanded role for chemokine-chemokine receptor biology in local immunomodulation and potentially glomerular homeostasis. By immunohistochemistry we found the chemokine receptor CCR7 expressed in a mesangial pattern while the CCR7 ligand SLC/CCL21 showed a podocyte-specific expression. CCR7 expression was further characterized by RT-PCR, RNase protection assays, and FACS analysis of cultured human MC, and was found to be constitutively present. Real-time PCR of microdissected glomeruli confirmed the expression of SLC/CCL21. A functional role for CCR7 was demonstrated for human MC migration and proliferation. A protective effect of SLC/CCL21 was shown for MC survival in Fas Ab-induced apoptosis. Finally, \"wound healing\" was enhanced in the presence of SLC/CCL21 in an in vitro injury model. The constitutive glomerular expression of CCR7 and its ligand SLC/CCL21 in adjacent cell types of the human kidney suggests novel biological functions of this chemokine/chemokine receptor pair and a potential role in processes involved in glomerular homeostasis and regeneration.',\n",

To test such hypothesis, it will be necessary to develop experimental animal models for the manipulation of U-II/UT receptor system.

Monkey and mouse UT receptors were 389, and 386 amino acids, respectively. Genomic organization of mouse genes showed that the preproU-II has four exons, while the UT receptor has one exon. Although initially viewed by many exclusively as cardiovascular targets, the present study demonstrates expression of mouse and monkey U-II/UT receptor mRNA in extra-vascular tissue including lung, pancreas, skeletal muscle, kidney and liver. Ligand binding studies showed that [125I]h U-II bound to a single sites to the cloned receptors in a saturable/high affinity manner (Kd 654+/-154 and 214+/-65 pM and Bmax of 1011+/-125 and 497+/-68 fmol mg-1 for mouse and monkey UT receptors, respectively).

This agonist, BAY 55-9837, was generated through site-directed mutagenesis based on sequence alignments of PACAP, VIP, and related analogs. The peptide bound to VPAC2 with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 0.65 nmol/l and displayed >100-fold selectivity over VPAC1. BAY 55-9837 stimulated glucose-dependent insulin secretion in isolated rat and human pancreatic islets, increased insulin synthesis in purified rat islets, and caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma insulin levels in fasted rats, with a half-maximal stimulatory concentration of 3 pmol/kg.

We found that these opposing responses arise from interactions of TSP1 with two different T cell receptors. The integrin alpha4beta1 recognizes an LDVP sequence in the NH2-terminal domain of TSP1 and was required for stimulation of T cell adhesion, chemotaxis, and matrix metalloproteinase gene expression by TSP1. Recognition of TSP1 by T cells depended on the activation state of alpha4beta1 integrin, and TSP1 inhibited interaction of activated alpha4beta1 integrin on T cells with its counter receptor vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. The alpha4beta1 integrin recognition site is conserved in TSP2. A recombinant piece of TSP2 containing this sequence replicated the alpha4beta1 integrin-dependent activities of TSP1. The beta1 integrin recognition sites in TSP1, however, were neither necessary nor sufficient for inhibition of T cell proliferation and T cell antigen receptor signaling by TSP1. A second TSP1 receptor, CD47, was not required for some stimulatory responses to TSP1 but played a significant role in its T cell antigen receptor antagonist and antiproliferative activities.

       "  'Abstract': 'Using immunocytochemistry, we have observed that the TSH receptor (TSHR) is concentrated at the leading edge of lamellipodia in both cultured human thyroid cells and in various transfected cells. This segregation of the receptor is due to its interaction with extracellular matrix (ECM) and specially with fibronectin. The TSHR, which interacts with the ECM, is known to undergo cleavage by a matrix metalloprotease. The homologous LH receptor, which does not interact with ECM, is not cleaved. The attachment to the ECM modifies the functional properties of the receptor: it increases adenylate cyclase stimulation by hormone, whereas PLC stimulation is not modified. Furthermore, the constitutive activity of the TSHR is only observed in attached cells, suggesting that it is dependent on TSHR interaction with the ECM. Thus, aside from its classical properties of hormone binding and signalization through G proteins, the TSHR is also involved in cell-matrix interactions, which modulate its functional properties.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The influence of platelets on the cellular metabolism of atherogenic lipoproteins has not been characterized in detail. Therefore, we investigated the effect of platelet factor 4 (PF4), a cationic protein released in high concentration by activated platelets, on the uptake and degradation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) via the LDL receptor (LDL-R). LDL-R-dependent binding, internalization, and degradation of LDL by cultured cells were inhibited 50%, 80%, and 80%, respectively, on addition of PF4. PF4 bound specifically to the ligand-binding domain of recombinant soluble LDL-R (half-maximal binding 0.5 microg/mL PF4) and partially (approximately 50%) inhibited the binding of LDL. Inhibition of internalization and degradation by PF4 required the presence of cell-associated proteoglycans, primarily those rich in chondroitin sulfate. PF4 variants with impaired heparin binding lacked the capacity to inhibit LDL. PF4, soluble LDL-R, and LDL formed ternary complexes with cell-surface proteoglycans. PF4 induced the retention of LDL/LDL-R complexes on the surface of human fibroblasts in multimolecular clusters unassociated with coated pits, as assessed by immuno-electron microscopy. These studies demonstrate that PF4 inhibits the catabolism of LDL in vitro in part by competing for binding to LDL-R, by promoting interactions with cell-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and by disrupting the normal endocytic trafficking of LDL/LDL-R complexes. Retention of LDL on cell surfaces may facilitate proatherogenic modifications and support an expanded role for platelets in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neuroplin-1 (NRP1), a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members, has three distinct extracellular domains, a1a2, b1b2, and c. To determine the VEGF(165) and placenta growth factor 2 (PlGF-2)-binding sites of NRP1, recombinant NRP1 domains were expressed in mammalian cells as Myc-tagged, soluble proteins, and used in co-precipitation experiments with 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-PlGF-2. Anti-Myc antibodies immunoprecipitated 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-PlGF-2 in the presence of the b1b2 but not of the a1a2 and c domains. Neither b1 nor b2 alone was capable of binding 125I-VEGF165. In competition experiments, VEGF165 competed PlGF-2 binding to the NRP1 b1b2 domain, suggesting that the binding sites of VEGF165 and PlGF-2 overlap. The presence of the a1a2 domain greatly enhanced VEGF165, but not PlGF-2 binding to b1b2. Heparin enhanced the binding of both 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-PlGF-2 to the b1b2 domain by 20- and 4-fold, respectively. A heparin chain of at least 20-24 monosaccharides was necessary for binding. In addition, the b1b2 domain of NRP1 could bind heparin directly, requiring heparin oligomers of at least 8 monosaccharide units. It was concluded that an intact b1b2 domain serves as the VEGF165-, PlGF-2-, and heparin-binding sites in NRP1, and that heparin is a critical component for regulating VEGF165 and PlGF-2 interactions with NRP1 by physically interacting with both receptor and ligands.',\n",

It has been demonstrated that DcR3 is up-regulated in lung and colon cancers, thus promoting tumor growth by neutralizing the cytotoxic effects of FasL and LIGHT. In this study, we found that DcR3.Fc profoundly modulated dendritic cell differentiation and maturation from CD14(+) monocytes, including the up-regulation of CD86/B7.2, and the down-regulation of CD40, CD54/ICAM-1, CD80/B7.1, CD1a, and HLA-DR. Moreover, DcR3-treated dendritic cells suppressed CD4(+) T cell proliferation in an allogeneic MLR and up-regulated IL-4 secretion of CD4(+)CD45RA(+) T cells. This suggests that DcR3.Fc may act not only as a decoy receptor to FasL and LIGHT, but also as an effector molecule to skew T cell response to the Th2 phenotype.',\n",

All of the human testicular macrophages expressed the markers CD45 and MAC387 and most also expressed CD4.

Although these networks have emerged as a general mechanism of cellular signalling, much less is known about the protein complexes associated with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Using a proteomic approach based on peptide affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting, we have identified 15 proteins that interact with the C- terminal tail of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C (5-HT(2C)) receptor, a GPCR. These proteins include several synaptic multidomain proteins containing one or several PDZ domains (PSD95 and the proteins of the tripartite complex Veli3-CASK-Mint1), proteins of the actin/spectrin cytoskeleton and signalling proteins. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that 5-HT(2C) receptors interact with PSD95 and the Veli3-CASK-Mint1 complex in vivo. Electron microscopy also indicated a synaptic enrichment of Veli3 and 5-HT(2C) receptors and their colocalization in microvilli of choroidal cells.

       "  'Abstract': 'The octapeptide hormone, angiotensin II (Ang II), exerts its major physiological effects by activating AT(1) receptors. In vivo Ang II is degraded to bioactive peptides, including Ang III (angiotensin-(2-8)) and Ang IV (angiotensin-(3-8)). These peptides stimulate inositol phosphate generation in human AT(1) receptor expressing CHO-K1 cells, but the potency of Ang IV is very low. Substitution of Asn(111) with glycine, which is known to cause constitutive receptor activation by disrupting its interaction with the seventh transmembrane helix (TM VII), selectively increased the potency of Ang IV (900-fold) and angiotensin-(4-8), and leads to partial agonism of angiotensin-(5-8). Consistent with the need for the interaction between Arg(2) of Ang II and Ang III with Asp(281), substitution of this residue with alanine (D281A) decreased the peptide\\'s potency without affecting that of Ang IV. All effects of the D281A mutation were superseded by the N111G mutation. The increased affinity of Ang IV to the N111G mutant was also demonstrated by binding studies. A model is proposed in which the Arg(2)-Asp(281) interaction causes a conformational change in TM VII of the receptor, which, similar to the N111G mutation, eliminates the constraining intramolecular interaction between Asn(111) and TM VII. The receptor adopts a more relaxed conformation, allowing the binding of the C-terminal five residues of Ang II that switches this \"preactivated\" receptor into the fully active conformation.',\n",

The melanocortin receptors support diverse physiological functions, including the regulation of hair color, adrenal function, energy homeostasis, feed efficiency, sebaceous gland lipid production and immune and sexual function. The melanocortins (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), beta-MSH and gamma-MSH) are agonist peptide ligands for the melanocortin receptors and these peptides are processed from the pre-prohormone proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Peptide antagonists for the melanocortin MC(1), MC(3) and MC(4) receptors include agouti-related protein (AgRP) and agouti. Diverse lines of evidence, including genetic and pharmacological data obtained in rodents and humans, support a role for the melanocortin MC(3) and MC(4) receptors in the regulation of energy homeostasis.

Recent attention has focused on the role of neuropeptide Y in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Neuropeptide Y stimulates food intake, inhibits energy expenditure, increases body weight and increases anabolic hormone levels by activating the neuropeptide Y Y(1) and Y(5) receptors in the hypothalamus. Based on these findings, several neuropeptide Y Y(1) and Y(5) receptor antagonists have been developed recently as potential anti-obesity agents. In addition, mice lacking neuropeptide Y, the neuropeptide Y Y(1) receptor or the neuropeptide Y Y(5) receptor have been generated. The data obtained to date with these newly developed tools suggests that neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists, particularly neuropeptide Y Y(1) receptor antagonists, may be useful anti-obesity agents. However, the redundancy of the neurochemical systems regulating energy homeostasis may limit the effect of ablating a single pathway. In addition, patients in whom the starvation response is activated, such as formerly obese patients who have lost weight or patients with complete or partial leptin deficiency, may be the best candidates for treatment with a neuropeptide Y receptor antagonist.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Nectins form a family of integral molecules that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Their ectodomain is made of three Ig-like domains (V, C, C). This family comprises at least five members, namely nectin1, -2, -3, -4, and poliovirus receptor (PVR), that are involved in different physiological and pathological processes. (i) Nectins are adhesion molecules localized at adherens junctions in epithelial cells. (ii) Some nectins act as poliovirus or alpha-herpesvirus receptors (nectin1). (iii) Nectin1 mutations are involved in orofacial developmental abnormalities in humans. Adhesion properties of nectins are mediated by Ca(2+)-independent homophilic and heterophilic processes through ectodomain trans-interactions. We have described a nectin trans-hetero-interaction network: nectin3 binds to nectin1, nectin2, and PVR; nectin1 also binds to nectin4. In the present study we compared the affinities of the different trans-interactions mediated by nectin1. We found that the K(D) of nectin1/nectin3 and nectin1/nectin4 interactions is 1 and 100 nm, respectively, whereas the K(D) of the nectin1-mediated homophilic interaction is 1 microm. We show that nectin1/nectin3 and nectin1/nectin4 trans-hetero-interactions were mediated through trans V to V domain interactions, whereas C domains contributed to increase the affinity of the interaction. Nectin3 and nectin4 share a common binding region in the nectin1 V domain: (i) nectin3 strongly competed with nectin4 binding, (ii) nectin3 and nectin4 binding to nectin1 was reduced by a number of monoclonal antibodies directed against the nectin1 V domain, and (iii) the glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus-1 that binds to the V domain of nectin1 reduced nectin3 and nectin4 binding. Finally, using chimeric nectin1/PVR receptors where PVR V domain beta-strands were substituted with the corresponding regions of nectin1, the nectin3 and nectin4 minimal binding region on nectin1 V domain was mapped to the C-C\\'-C\"-D beta-strands.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Endoglin is an auxiliary component of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor system, able to associate with the signaling receptor types I (TbetaRI) and II (TbetaRII) in the presence of ligand and to modulate the cellular responses to TGF-beta1. Endoglin cannot bind ligand on its own but requires the presence of the signaling receptors, supporting a critical role for the interaction between endoglin and TbetaRI or TbetaRII. This study shows that full-length endoglin interacts with both TbetaRI and TbetaRII, independently of their kinase activation state or the presence of exogenous TGF-beta1. Truncated constructs encoding either the extracellular or the cytoplasmic domains of endoglin demonstrated that the association with the signaling receptors occurs through both extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. However, a more specific mapping revealed that the endoglin/TbetaRI interaction was different from that of endoglin/TbetaRII. TbetaRII interacts with the amino acid region 437-558 of the extracellular domain of endoglin, whereas TbetaRI interacts not only with the region 437-558 but also with the protein region located between amino acid 437 and the N terminus. Both TbetaRI and TbetaRII interact with the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin, but TbetaRI only interacts when the kinase domain is inactive, whereas TbetaRII remains associated in its active and inactive forms. Upon association, TbetaRI and TbetaRII phosphorylate the endoglin cytoplasmic domain, and then TbetaRI, but not TbetaRII, kinase dissociates from the complex. Conversely, endoglin expression results in an altered phosphorylation state of TbetaRII, TbetaRI, and downstream Smad proteins as well as a modulation of TGF-beta signaling, as measured by the reporter gene expression. These results suggest that by interacting through its extracellular and cytoplasmic domains with the signaling receptors, endoglin might affect TGF-beta responses.',\n",

Human and mouse IL-23 exhibit some activities similar to IL-12, but differ in their capacities to stimulate particular populations of memory T cells. Like IL-12, IL-23 binds to the IL-12R subunit IL-12Rbeta1. However, it does not use IL-12Rbeta2. In this study, we identify a novel member of the hemopoietin receptor family as a subunit of the receptor for IL-23, \"IL-23R.\" IL-23R pairs with IL-12Rbeta1 to confer IL-23 responsiveness on cells expressing both subunits. Human IL-23, but not IL-12, exhibits detectable affinity for human IL-23R. Anti-IL-12Rbeta1 and anti-IL-23R Abs block IL-23 responses of an NK cell line and Ba/F3 cells expressing the two receptor chains. IL-23 activates the same Jak-stat signaling molecules as IL-12: Jak2, Tyk2, and stat1, -3, -4, and -5, but stat4 activation is substantially weaker and different DNA-binding stat complexes form in response to IL-23 compared with IL-12. IL-23R associates constitutively with Jak2 and in a ligand-dependent manner with stat3. The ability of cells to respond to IL-23 or IL-12 correlates with expression of IL-23R or IL-12Rbeta2, respectively. The human IL-23R gene is on human chromosome 1 within 150 kb of IL-12Rbeta2.',\n",

Inhibition of nocturnal locomotor activity in rats by intracerebroventricular delivery of recombinant PK2 during subjective night, when the endogenous PK2 mRNA level is low, further supports the hypothesis that PK2 is an output molecule that transmits behavioural circadian rhythm.

The reabsorption of phosphate in the kidney is a major determinant of the plasma levels of phosphate. Phosphatonin is a hormone-like factor that specifically inhibits phosphate uptake in renal proximal epithelial cells. Recent studies on tumor-induced osteomalacia suggested that phosphatonin was potentially identical to fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23. However, as purified recombinant FGF-23 could not inhibit phosphate uptake in renal proximal epithelial cells, the mechanism of action of FGF-23 remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we examined the mechanism of action of FGF-23 in cultured renal proximal epithelial cells, opossum kidney cells. FGF-23 was found to require heparin-like molecules for its inhibitory activity on phosphate uptake. FGF-23 binds to the FGF receptor 3c, which is mainly expressed in opossum kidney cells, with high affinity. An inhibitor for tyrosine kinases of the FGF receptor, SU 5402, blocked the activity of FGF-23. FGF-23 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is the major intracellular signaling pathway of FGF. Inhibitors of the MAPK pathway, PD98059 and SB203580, also blocked the activity of FGF-23. The present findings have revealed a novel MAPK-dependent mechanism of the regulation of phosphate uptake by FGF signaling.',\n",

We previously reported that the adhesion of endothelial cells, platelets, and fibroblasts to these extracellular matrix-associated proteins is mediated through integrin receptors. In this study, we demonstrated that both Cyr61 and CTGF are expressed in advanced atherosclerotic lesions of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Because monocyte adhesion and transmigration are important for atherosclerosis, wound healing, and inflammation, we examined the interaction of THP-1 monocytic cells and isolated peripheral blood monocytes with Cyr61 and CTGF. THP-1 cells and monocytes adhered to Cyr61- or CTGF-coated wells in an activation-dependent manner and this process was mediated primarily through integrin alpha(M)beta(2). Additionally, expression of alpha(M)beta(2) on human embryonic kidney 293 cells resulted in enhanced cell adhesion to Cyr61. Consistent with these data, a GST-fusion protein containing the I domain of the integrin alpha(M) subunit bound specifically to immobilized Cyr61 or CTGF. We have also investigated the requirement of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as coreceptors for monocyte adhesion to Cyr61. Pretreatment of monocytes with heparin or heparinase I resulted in partial inhibition of cell adhesion to Cyr61. However, monocytes, but not fibroblasts, were capable of adhering to a Cyr61 mutant deficient in heparin binding activity. Collectively, these results show that activated monocytes adhere to Cyr61 and CTGF through integrin alpha(M)beta(2) and cell surface HSPGs. However, unlike fibroblast adhesion to Cyr61, cell surface HSPGs are not absolutely required for this adhesion process.',\n",

To address structural aspects of this phenomenon, a receptor-active apoE peptide, encompassing the receptor-binding region of the protein, was studied by NMR in the presence of the lipid-mimicking agent trifluoroethanol. In 50% trifluoroethanol, apoE-(126-183) forms a continuous amphipathic alpha-helix over residues Thr(130)-Glu(179). Detailed NMR relaxation analysis indicates a high degree of plasticity for the residues surrounding 149-159. This intrinsic flexibility imposes a curvature to the peptide that may be important in terms of interaction of apoE with various sized lipid particles and the LDL receptor. Residues 165-179 of apoE may act as a molecular switch whereby these residues are unstructured in the absence of lipids and prevent interaction with the LDL receptor. In the presence of lipids, these residues become helical resulting in a receptor-active conformation of the protein. Furthermore, the electrostatic characteristics and geometric features of apoE-(126-183) suggest that apoE binds to the LDL receptor by interacting with more than one of the receptor ligand-binding repeats.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'BMP15, also known as growth and differentiation factor 9B (GDF9B), is a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (TGFbeta) which in humans, rodents and sheep is expressed exclusively in the oocyte. BMP15 is closely related to GDF9, another oocyte-specific member of this superfamily which has been shown to be essential for early ovarian folliculogenesis. Inactivation of the BMP15 gene in mice has shown only minor effects on fertility. However, Inverdale and Hanna lines of sheep carry naturally occurring mutations in BMP15 which highlight differences in the action of this gene between mice and other mammals. Sheep which are heterozygous show an increase in ovulation rate whereas homozygotes are infertile. The granulosa cell receptor which mediates the BMP15 response has not yet been identified, but the discovery that a point mutation in the BMP1B receptor in Booroola sheep is responsible for increased ovulation rate highlights the importance of the TGFbeta signalling molecules in early folliculogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Renin is an aspartyl protease essential for the control of blood pressure and was long suspected to have cellular receptors. We report the expression cloning of the human renin receptor complementary DNA encoding a 350-amino acid protein with a single transmembrane domain and no homology with any known membrane protein. Transfected cells stably expressing the receptor showed renin- and prorenin-specific binding. The binding of renin induced a fourfold increase of the catalytic efficiency of angiotensinogen conversion to angiotensin I and induced an intracellular signal with phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine residues associated to an activation of MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2. High levels of the receptor mRNA are detected in the heart, brain, placenta, and lower levels in the kidney and liver. By confocal microscopy the receptor is localized in the mesangium of glomeruli and in the subendothelium of coronary and kidney artery, associated to smooth muscle cells and colocalized with renin. The renin receptor is the first described for an aspartyl protease. This discovery emphasizes the role of the cell surface in angiotensin II generation and opens new perspectives on the tissue renin-angiotensin system and on renin effects independent of angiotensin II.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Human thyrotropin (TSH), luteotropin (LH), follitropin (FSH), and chorionic gonadotropin are members of the heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone family. The common alpha subunit forms noncovalent heterodimers with different beta subunits. Two novel human glycoprotein hormonelike genes, alpha2 (A2) and beta5 (B5), recently have been identified. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, the two subunits were found as potential heterodimerization partners. Immunological analyses confirmed the heterodimerization of A2 and B5 in transfected cells and their colocalization in the anterior pituitary. Recombinant A2/B5 heterodimeric glycoproteins, purified using cation exchange and size fractionation chromatography, activated human TSH receptors, but not LH and FSH receptors, and showed high affinity to TSH receptors in a radioligand receptor assay. The heterodimer also stimulated cAMP production and thymidine incorporation by cultured thyroid cells and increased serum thyroxine levels in TSH-suppressed rats in vivo. This new heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone was named as thyrostimulin based on its thyroid-stimulating activity. The expression of thyrostimulin in the anterior pituitary known to express TSH receptors suggested a paracrine mechanism. The present discovery of a new ligand based on genomic approaches could facilitate the understanding of the physiological roles of extra-thyroid TSH receptor systems and the structural-functional basis of receptor signaling by related glycoprotein hormones.',\n",

The promoters of HES1 and HES5, which are the downstream transducers of Notch signaling, were activated by NOV. Expressions of NOV and Notch1 were concomitant in the presomitic mesoderm and later in the myocytes and chondrocytes, suggesting their synergistic effects in mesenchymal cell differentiation. In C2/4 myogenic cells, elevated expression of NOV led to down-regulation of MyoD and myogenin, resulting in inhibition of myotube formation.

       "  'Abstract': 'The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins mediate cell cell interactions during cell growth and differentiation in both embryos and adults. Canonical Wnt signalling by way of the beta-catenin pathway is transduced by two receptor families. Frizzled proteins and lipoprotein-receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) bind Wnts and transmit their signal by stabilizing intracellular beta-catenin. Wnt/beta-catenin signalling is inhibited by the secreted protein Dickkopf1 (Dkk1), a member of a multigene family, which induces head formation in amphibian embryos. Dkk1 has been shown to inhibit Wnt signalling by binding to and antagonizing LRP5/6. Here we show that the transmembrane proteins Kremen1 and Kremen2 are high-affinity Dkk1 receptors that functionally cooperate with Dkk1 to block Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Kremen2 forms a ternary complex with Dkk1 and LRP6, and induces rapid endocytosis and removal of the Wnt receptor LRP6 from the plasma membrane. The results indicate that Kremen1 and Kremen2 are components of a membrane complex modulating canonical Wnt signalling through LRP6 in vertebrates.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Erythropoiesis is regulated not only by erythropoietin but also by microenvironments which are composed of transmembrane molecules. We have previously shown that a receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4 is predominantly expressed on human erythroid progenitors in bone marrow. EphB4 is expressed in approximately 45% of hematopoietic progenitor cells, which are CD34-positive and c-Kit-positive in human umbilical cord blood (hUCB). The transmembrane ligand for EphB4 or ephrin-B2 is expressed on bone marrow stromal cells and arterial endothelial cells. When such EphB4-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells were co-cultured with stromal cells which express ephrin-B2, they were immediately detached from stromal cells and differentiated to mature erythroid cells. At that time, expression of EphB4 immediately down-regulated. In contrast, on ephrin-B2 non-expressing stromal cells, they remained EphB4-positive cells and the generated number of mature erythroid cells was less than that on ephrin-B2 expressing stromal cells. Additionally, ephrin-B2 expression on endothelial cells up-regulated under hypoxic condition. Taken together, we propose that one of the molecular cues that regulate erythropoiesis is ephrin-B2 on stromal cells.',\n",

EG-VEGF/prokineticins provoke rapid phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase and DNA synthesis in the bovine adrenal capillary endothelial cells (BACE). The mRNAs of both EG-VEGF/PK-R1 and -R2 were expressed in BACE.

Overall agonist binding affinities were increased for both fusion constructs when compared to the wild type receptor. [35 S]GTPgammaS binding was performed on pertussis toxin treated cells to monitor coupling efficiency of the fusion constructs. Upon agonist addition hMOR-C351I Gi1 a exhibited an activation profile similar to the non-fused receptor while hMOR-C352I Gi2 alpha was poorly activated. Interestingly no correlation could be drawn between agonist binding affinity and efficacy. Upon agonist addition, forskolin-stimulated cAMP production, as measured using a reporter gene assay, was inhibited by signals transduced via the fused Gi1 alpha and Gi2 alpha mainly. In contrast both fusion constructs were able to initiate ERK-MAPK phosphorylation via coupling to endogenous G proteins only. In conclusion our data indicate that hMOR couples more efficiently to Gi1 alpha than Gi2 alpha and that the coupling efficacy is clearly agonist-dependent.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The inhibitory activity associated with myelin is a major obstacle for successful axon regeneration in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In addition to myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and Nogo-A, available evidence suggests the existence of additional inhibitors in CNS myelin. We show here that a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored CNS myelin protein, oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), is a potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. Like Nogo-A, OMgp contributes significantly to the inhibitory activity associated with CNS myelin. To further elucidate the mechanisms that mediate this inhibitory activity of OMgp, we screened an expression library and identified the Nogo receptor (NgR) as a high-affinity OMgp-binding protein. Cleavage of NgR and other GPI-linked proteins from the cell surface renders axons of dorsal root ganglia insensitive to OMgp. Introduction of exogenous NgR confers OMgp responsiveness to otherwise insensitive neurons. Thus, OMgp is an important inhibitor of neurite outgrowth that acts through NgR and its associated receptor complex. Interfering with the OMgp/NgR pathway may allow lesioned axons to regenerate after injury in vivo.',\n",

In receptor binding studies, performed using CHO cells expressing the recombinant human NC receptor (CHO(hOP4)) and in rat cerebral cortex membranes, [(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2), [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2), and [(pCN)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) displayed higher affinity than NC(1-13)NH(2). The affinity of [(pCl)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) was essentially identical to that of NC(1-13)NH(2), while the remaining compounds displayed reduced affinity. In a series of functional assays (stimulation of GTPgammaS binding in CHO(hOP4)cells and rat cerebral cortex membranes and inhibition of cAMP accumulation in CHO(hOP4) cells), the para substituted analogues behaved as full agonists (with the exception of [(pOH)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) which acted as a partial agonist in the GTPgammaS binding assays) with the following rank order potency:[(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) and [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) were either inactive or displayed micromolar potencies in cAMP accumulation experiments performed on cells expressing classical opioid receptors. All compounds were full agonists in isolated tissues from various species (guinea pig ileum, mouse colon and mouse/rat vas deferens) with the exception of [(pOH)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) which displayed partial agonist/weak antagonist activities. The rank order of potency was similar to that found in the other assays. The effects of all analogues were not modified by naloxone.

This study further supports the notion that Phe(4) of NC is the critical residue for receptor occupation and activation. Moreover, as part of this study, we have identified two novel, highly potent and selective agonists for the OP(4) receptor, [(pF)Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2) and [(pNO(2))Phe(4)]NC(1-13)NH(2).',\n",

Binding of radiolabelled chemokines IL-8, RANTES, MCP-1, but not MIP-1alpha, was found on venular endothelial cells in inflamed synovia from both rheumatoid and non-rheumatoid patients. Excess homologous unlabelled chemokine displaced binding and excess unlabelled RANTES could displace radiolabelled IL-8 binding.

There was downregulation of DARC protein and mRNA in rheumatoid samples. Binding of IL-8 to both rheumatoid and non-rheumatoid synovia was significantly reduced in the presence of anti-DARC Fy3 and Fy6 monoclonal antibodies. These findings show the expression of a multispecific chemokine binding site on the inflamed synovial endothelium, with evidence for involvement of DARC.

       "  'Abstract': 'CCR6 is the receptor for the chemokine MIP-3 alpha/CCL20. Almost all chemokine receptors contain cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain and in the first, second, and third extracellular loops. In this report, we have studied the importance of all cysteine residues in the CCR6 sequence using site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical techniques. Like all G protein-coupled receptors, mutating disulfide bond-forming cysteines in the first (Cys118) and second (Cys197) extracellular loops in CCR6 led to complete elimination of receptor activity, which for CCR6 was also associated with the accumulation of the receptor intracellularly. Although two additional cysteines in the N-terminal region and the third extracellular loop, which are present in almost all chemokine receptors, are presumed to form a disulfide bond, this has not been demonstrated experimentally for any of these receptors. We found that mutating the cysteines in the N-terminal domain (Cys36) and the third extracellular loop (Cys288) neither significantly affected receptor surface expression nor completely abolished receptor function. Importantly, contrary to several previous reports, we demonstrated directly that instead of forming a disulfide bond, the N-terminal cysteine (Cys36) and the third extracellular loop cysteine (Cys288) contain free SH groups. The cysteine residues (Cys36 and Cys288), rather than forming a disulfide bond, may be important per se. We propose that CCR6 forms only a disulfide bond between the first (Cys118) and second (Cys197) extracellular loops, which confines a helical bundle together with the N-terminus adjacent to the third extracellular loop, creating the structural organization critical for ligand binding and therefore for receptor signaling.',\n",

GPIb binds to the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (vWF-A1) at high blood shear, initiating platelet adhesion and contributing to the formation of a thrombus. To investigate the molecular basis of GPIb regulation and ligand binding, we have determined the structure of the N-terminal domain of the GPIb(alpha) chain (residues 1-279). This structure is the first determined from the cell adhesion/signaling class of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins and reveals the topology of the characteristic disulfide-bonded flanking regions. The fold consists of an N-terminal beta-hairpin, eight leucine-rich repeats, a disulfide-bonded loop, and a C-terminal anionic region. The structure also demonstrates a novel LRR motif in the form of an M-shaped arrangement of three tandem beta-turns. Negatively charged binding surfaces on the LRR concave face and anionic region indicate two-step binding kinetics to vWF-A1, which can be regulated by an unmasking mechanism involving conformational change of a key loop. Using molecular docking of the GPIb and vWF-A1 crystal structures, we were also able to model the GPIb.vWF-A1 complex.',\n",

However, these chimeras weakly bind to ErbB-3 alone. To further dissect the ligand binding selectivity of the ErbB network, we have applied the phage display technique to examine the role of the linear N-terminal region in EGF for interaction with ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers. A library of EGF variants was constructed in which residues 2, 3, and 4 were randomly mutated, followed by selection for binding to intact MDA-MB-453 cells that overexpress ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 but lack ErbB-1. Analysis of the selected phage EGF variants revealed clones with high binding affinity to ErbB-2/ErbB-3 while maintaining high affinity to ErbB-1. In these variants, Trp (or alternatively His) was almost exclusively present at position 2, while specific combinations of hydrophobic, basic, and small residues were found at positions 3 and 4. The mitogenic activity of the phage EGF variants corresponded with their relative binding affinity. Two of the selected EGF variants, EGF/WVS and EGF/WRS, were further characterized as recombinant proteins. In contrast to previously characterized chimeras of EGF with NRG-1 or TGF-alpha, these variants did not only show high binding affinity for ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers but also for ErbB-3 alone. These data show that the linear N-terminal region of EGF-like growth factors is directly involved in binding to ErbB-3.',\n",

Monocyte infiltration is implicated, but its mechanisms are unclear given that HSV normally expresses the ICAM-1 but not the VCAM-1 adhesion molecule. To define the mechanisms underlying monocyte adhesion, samples of HSV taken from coronary artery bypass graft patients were co-cultured with human monocytes and adherent monocytes were quantified by immunocytochemistry for CD68 on transverse sections. Pre-treatment of veins with anti-ICAM-1 antibodies reduced monocyte adhesion (monocytes/mm of section) from 7.2 +/- 1.5 to 3.1 +/- 0.7 (p < 0.05, n = 6), but the effect of anti-VCAM-1 was not significant (4.1 +/- 0.7). Paradoxically, pre-treatment of monocytes with either anti-beta(2)-integrins, the counter-receptor of ICAM-1, or anti-alpha(4) integrins, the counter-receptor of VCAM-1, significantly reduced adhesion (1.8 +/- 0.6 and 2.4 +/- 0.7, respectively, p < 0.05). These results were clarified by immunocytochemistry, which confirmed that VCAM-1 expression was absent in harvested vein but was induced in the endothelium during co-culture. Consistent with this, when anti-ICAM-1 or anti-VCAM-1 was present throughout co-culture, either of them reduced adhesion (from 4.2 +/- 0.9 to 2.3 +/- 0.5 and 2.2 +/- 0.4, respectively, p < 0.02, n = 8) and there was no further effect of adding both (2.0 +/- 0.5).

       "  'Abstract': 'Decorin, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, is a key regulator of tumor growth by acting as an antagonist of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. To search for cell surface receptors interacting with decorin, we generated a decorin/alkaline phosphatase chimeric protein and used it to screen a cDNA library by expression cloning. We identified two strongly reactive clones that encoded either the full-length EGFR or its ectodomain. A physiologically relevant interaction between decorin and EGFR was confirmed in the yeast two-hybrid system and further validated by experiments using EGF/EGFR interaction and transient cell transfection assays. Using a panel of deletion mutants, decorin binding was mapped to a narrow region of the EGFR within its ligand-binding L2 domain. Moreover, the central leucine-rich repeat 6 of decorin was required for interaction with the EGFR. Site-directed mutagenesis of the EGFR L2 domain showed that a cluster of residues, His(394)-Ile(402), was essential for both decorin and EGF binding. In contrast, K465, previously shown to be cross-linked to epidermal growth factor (EGF), was required for EGF but not for decorin binding. Thus, decorin binds to a discrete region of the EGFR, partially overlapping with but distinct from the EGF-binding domain. These findings could lead to the generation of protein mimetics capable of suppressing EGFR function.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Several orphan G protein-coupled receptors homologous to gonadotropin and thyrotropin receptors have recently been identified and named as LGR4-8. INSL3, also known as Leydig insulin-like peptide or relaxin-like factor, is a relaxin family member expressed in testis Leydig cells and ovarian theca and luteal cells. Male mice mutant for INSL3 exhibit cryptorchidism or defects in testis descent due to abnormal gubernaculum development whereas overexpression of INSL3 induces ovary descent in transgenic females. Because transgenic mice missing the LGR8 gene are also cryptorchid, INSL3 was tested as the ligand for LGR8. Here, we show that treatment with INSL3 stimulated cAMP production in cells expressing recombinant LGR8 but not LGR7. In addition, interactions between INSL3 and LGR8 were demonstrated following ligand receptor cross-linking. Northern blot analysis indicated that the LGR8 transcripts are expressed in gubernaculum whereas treatment of cultured gubernacular cells with INSL3 stimulated cAMP production and thymidine incorporation. The present study identified the ligand for an orphan G protein-coupled receptor based on common phenotypes of ligand and receptor null mice. Demonstration of INSL3 as the ligand for LGR8 facilitates understanding of the mechanism of testis descent and allows studies on the role of INSL3 in gonadal and other physiological processes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The B cell surface molecule CD22 is a member of the Siglec family. Siglecs possess a conserved membrane-distal immunoglobulin domain that mediates binding to sialylated glycoproteins or glycolipids. Although the structural basis of sialic acid recognition by Siglecs is quite well understood, the binding properties of the interaction between Siglecs and their native ligands have not been investigated. CD22 binding requires alpha2-6-linked sialic acid, which is mostly carried on N-glycans. One protein that carries such N-glycans is CD45. In this study we used surface plasmon resonance to perform thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of CD22 binding to native CD45. CD22 bound with a low affinity (K(d) 130 microM at 25 degrees C) and very fast kinetics (k(off) >or=18 s(-1), calculated k(on) >or=1.5 x 10(5) M(-1)s(-1)). Van't Hoff analysis revealed that binding was enthalpically driven at physiological temperatures, as is typical of most lectin-carbohydrate interactions. Since there is evidence that CD22 binds preferably to CD45, even though many cell surface proteins carry alpha2-6-linked sialic acid, we compared the affinities of CD22 binding to CD45, to CD4 carrying alpha2-6-linked sialic acid, and to a synthetic alpha2-6-sialoglycoconjugate. The affinities did not differ substantially, suggesting that CD22 binds preferentially to CD45 not because the latter presents higher affinity ligands but because it carries multiple copies of thereof.\",\n",

A., Nguyen, T., Cheng, R., Rasmussen, J. S., Marchese, A., Zastawny, R., Heng, H. H., Tsui, L. C., Shi, X., Asa, S., Puy, L., and George, S. R. (1995) Genomics 28, 84-91; Lee, D. K., Nguyen, T., Porter, C. A., Cheng, R., George, S. R., and O'Dowd, B. F. (1999) Mol. Brain Res. 71, 96-103). The expression of this gene was detected in various tissues in rats, including the lymphoid organs, central nervous system, mammary glands, and uterus. GPR7 mRNA was mainly detected in the central nervous system and uterus. In situ hybridization showed that the gene encoding the GPR7 ligand was expressed in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of rats. To determine the molecular structure of the endogenous GPR7 ligand, we purified it from bovine hypothalamic tissue extracts on the basis of cAMP production-inhibitory activity to cells expressing GPR7. Through structural analyses, we found that the purified endogenous ligand was a peptide with 29 amino acid residues and that it was uniquely modified with bromine. We subsequently determined that the C-6 position of the indole moiety in the N-terminal Trp was brominated. We believe this is the first report on a neuropeptide modified with bromine and have hence named it neuropeptide B. In in vitro assays, bromination did not influence the binding of neuropeptide B to the receptor.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The human genome encodes five nonpolymorphic major histocompatibility complex class I-like glycoproteins, CD1a to CD1e, that present lipid antigens for specific recognition by T lymphocytes. Using single alkyl chain detergents, we developed a protocol to generate recombinant human CD1b-lipid complexes. We present here the crystal structures of CD1b in complex with either phosphatidylinositol or ganglioside GM2 at 2.3 A and 2.8 A resolutions, respectively. The antigen-binding groove houses four interlinked hydrophobic channels that are occupied by the alkyl chains of the glycolipid plus two detergent molecules. A distinct exit beneath the alpha 2 helix further contributes to the plasticity of the binding groove. These structures reveal the mechanism by which two alkyl chain lipids bind to CD1b, and how CD1b can adapt to ligands of different alkyl chain length. They also suggest how very long alkyl chains, such as those of mycolic acid, could be fully contained within the binding groove. These results extend the spectrum of potential CD1b ligands by revealing that, in addition to two alkyl chain lipids, mono-alkyl and triple-alkyl chain lipids can be accommodated in the binding groove.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recent studies have demonstrated that neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is involved in multiple adhesive interactions with several different classes of ligands on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. One of these ligands is fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) that is expressed on neural cells. While it is known that CD56 is a molecular isoform of NCAM expressed on human NK cells and a subset of T cells, it remains poorly characterized, with its ligand unidentified. Therefore, we were prompted to examine if CD56 molecules on NK cells interact with FGFR expressed on T cells. We demonstrate that ligation of FGFR1 beta on J.C2-14 Jurkat T cells by CD56 on fixed NK-92 cells costimulates TCR/CD3-triggered IL-2 production. CD56-binding mAbs inhibited the costimulatory effect of NK-92 cells in 50-75%. Flow cytometric analysis and cell adhesion assays showed that FGFR1 beta/Fc and FGFR2 beta/Fc chimeric proteins bind to NK-92 cells. The binding of FGFR1 beta/Fc protein to CD56 molecules was verified by immunoprecipitation of CD56 with anti-CD56 mAb followed by Western blotting with FGFR1 beta/Fc. These findings suggest that ligation of FGFR1 by CD56 may contribute to the interaction between NK cells and T cells that we have postulated in our previous studies.',\n",

To investigate the potential role of MK in tumor growth, we expressed MK in human SW-13 cells and studied receptor binding, signal transduction, and activity of MK. The MK protein stimulates soft agar colony formation in vitro and tumor growth of SW-13 cells in athymic nude mice, as well as proliferation of human endothelial cells from brain microvasculature and umbilical vein (HUVEC) in the low ng/ml range. MK binds to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), the receptor for PTN, with an apparent K(d) of 170 pm in intact cells, and this receptor binding of MK is competed by PTN with an apparent K(d) of approximately 20 pm. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the extracellular ligand-binding domain of ALK inhibit ALK receptor binding of MK as well as MK-stimulated colony formation of SW-13 cells. Furthermore, MK stimulates ALK phosphorylation in WI-38 human fibroblasts and activates PI3-kinase and MAP kinase signal transduction in WI-38, HUVEC, neuroblastoma (SH SY-5Y) and glioblastoma (U87MG) cells that express the ALK protein. We conclude that MK can act as a growth, survival, and angiogenic factor during tumorigenesis and signals through the ALK receptor.',\n",

Here, we report the identification of the endogenous ligand for both of these receptors. We purified the peptide ligand from porcine hypothalamus using stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing human GPR8 and cloned the cDNA encoding its precursor protein. The cDNA encodes two forms of the peptide ligand with lengths of 23 and 30 amino acid residues as mature peptides. We designated the two ligands neuropeptide W-23 (NPW23) and neuropeptide W-30 (NPW30). The amino acid sequence of NPW23 is completely identical to that of the N-terminal 23 residues of NPW30. Synthetic NPW23 and NPW30 activated and bound to both GPR7 and GPR8 at similar effective doses. Intracerebroventricular administration of NPW23 in rats increased food intake and stimulated prolactin release. These findings indicate that neuropeptide W is the endogenous ligand for both GPR7 and GPR8 and acts as a mediator of the central control of feeding and the neuroendocrine system.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The human VPAC1 receptor for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) belongs to the class II family of G protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane segments. It recognizes several VIP-related peptides and displays a very low affinity for secretin despite >70% homology between VIP and secretin. Conversely, the human secretin receptor has high affinity for secretin but low affinity for VIP. We took advantage of this reversed selectivity to identify a domain of the VPAC1 receptor responsible for selectivity toward secretin by constructing human VPAC1-secretin receptor chimeras. A first set of chimeras consisted of exchanging the entire N-terminal ectodomain or large parts of this domain. They were constructed by overlap PCR, transfected in COS-7 cells, and their ligand selectivity, expressed as the ratio of EC(50) for secretin/EC(50) for VIP (referred to as S/V), in stimulating cAMP production was measured. Two very informative chimeras respectively referred to as S144V and S123V were obtained by replacing the entire ectodomain or only the first 123 amino acids of the VPAC1 receptor by the corresponding sequences of the secretin receptor. Whereas S144V no longer discriminated between VIP and secretin (S/V = 1.2), S123V discriminated between the two peptides (S/V = 300) in the same manner as the wild-type VPAC1 receptor. The motif responsible for discrimination was determined by introducing small blocks or individual amino acids of secretin receptor in the 123-144 sequence of the S123V chimera. The data obtained from 14 new chimeras sustained that two nonadjacent pairs of amino acids, Gln(135) Thr(136) and Gly(140) Ser(141) in the C-terminal end of the N-terminal VPAC1 receptor ectodomain constitute a selective filter that strongly restricts access of secretin to the VPAC1 receptor.',\n",

GDF-9 is a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of ligands known to signal through type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors. In the sequenced human genome, seven type I and six type II receptors have been identified. Based on phylogenetic and sequence analyses, we predicted that GDF-9 likely interacts with known type I and type II receptors. We obtained soluble chimeric proteins with the ectodomains of candidate receptors fused to the Fc portion of immunoglobin and tested their ability to act as functional antagonists. Addition of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPRII) ectodomain was most effective in blocking GDF-9 stimulation of granulosa cell proliferation and GDF-9 suppression of FSH-stimulated progesterone production. In addition, the ectodomains of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IA, bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IB, and activin receptor type IIA were partially effective in blocking GDF-9 action. Furthermore, the BMPRII ectodomain directly interacted with GDF-9 in a coprecipitation study demonstrating the role of the BMPRII ectodomain as a binding protein for GDF-9. To demonstrate the role of BMPRII in GDF-9 signaling in follicular cells, the expression of this protein was blocked in cultured granulosa cells using specific BMPRII antisense oligomers. Inhibition of BMPRII biosynthesis completely prevented the GDF-9 induction of granulosa cell thymidine incorporation. GDF-9 expression is essential for early follicle development, and the presence of the type II and type I receptors in the neonatal rat ovary was verified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These results demonstrate the important role of BMPRII in mediating GDF-9 action in granulosa cells from small antral follicles and indicate that the effects of GDF-9 might be transduced by binding to BMPRII and one or more type I receptors.',\n",

Direct interaction of apolipoprotein E (apoE) with this receptor has never been demonstrated, and its implication in CE uptake is still controversial. By using a human adrenal cell line (NCI-H295R), we have addressed the role of apoE in binding to SR-BI and in selective CE uptake from lipoproteins to cells. This cell line does not secrete apoE and SR-BI is its major HDL-binding protein. We can now provide evidence that 1) free apoE is a ligand for SR-BI, 2) apoE associated to lipids or in lipoproteins does not modulate binding or CE-selective uptake by the SR-BI pathway, and 3) the direct interaction of free apoE to SR-BI leads to an increase in CE uptake from lipoproteins of both low and high densities. We propose that this direct interaction could modify SR-BI structure in cell membranes and potentiate CE uptake.',\n",

Although there have been a number of mammalian Frizzled members identified, their binding specificities with Wnt and functions in mammalian cells have been poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that rat Frizzled-9 (Rfz9) functions in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in 293T cells. Rfz9 overexpression induces the hyperphosphorylation and relocalization of mouse Dishevelled-1 (Dvl-1) from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane and the accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin. Transfections of Rfz9 with each of several Wnt members show that only Wnt-2 activates Rfz9 in T cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcription. Deletion mutant analysis determines that there is a difference in Rfz9 C-terminal residues required for the modifications of Dvl-1 and those required for the inductions of beta-catenin stabilization and TCF transactivation. Deletion of the Wnt-binding domain does not abolish Rfz9 activity completely, although it causes the inactivation of Wnt-2-dependent TCF transcription. Rfz9 also relocalizes Axin from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in the presence of Dvl-1, suggesting that one of the consequences of Dvl-1 relocalization by Rfz9 is to bring Axin to the cell membrane.',\n",

In addition to MMP-2, MCP-3 is efficiently cleaved by membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP, the cellular activator of MMP-2, and by collagenase-1 and collagenase-3 (MMP-1, MMP-13) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3). Specificity was shown by absence of cleavage by matrilysin (MMP-7) and the leukocytic MMPs neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) and gelatinase B (MMP-9). The closely related chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-4 were not cleaved by MMP-2 or MT1-MMP, but were cleaved by MMP-1 and MMP-3 with varying efficiency. MCPs were typically cleaved between residues 4 and 5, but MCP-4 was further processed at Val7-Pro8. Synthetic MCP analogs corresponding to the MMP-cleaved forms bound CC chemokine receptor (CCR)-2 and CCR-3, but lacked chemoattractant activity in pre-B cells transfected with CCR-2 and CCR-3 or in THP-1 monocytic cells, a transformed leukemic cell line. Moreover, the truncated products of MCP-2 and MCP-4, like MCP-3, were potent antagonists of their cognate CC chemokine receptors in transwell cell migration assays in vitro.

In this study, we examine the mechanism of endocytosis of IFNGR-1 and the relationship of its nuclear translocation to that of STAT1alpha. In untreated WISH cells, both IFNGR-1 and IFNGR-2 were constitutively localized within caveolae-like microdomains isolated from plasma membrane. However, treatment of cells with IFN-gamma resulted in rapid migration of IFNGR-1, but not IFNGR-2, from these microdomains. Filipin pretreatment, which specifically inhibits endocytosis from caveolae-like microdomains, inhibited the nuclear translocation of IFN-gamma and IFNGR-1 as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1alpha, but did not affect the binding of IFN-gamma to these cells. In the Jurkat T lymphocyte cell line, which does not express caveolin-1, nuclear translocation of IFNGR-1 and STAT1alpha were similarly inhibited by filipin pretreatment. Isolation of lipid microdomains from Jurkat cells showed that both IFNGR-1 and IFNGR-2 were associated with lipid microdomains only after stimulation with IFN-gamma, suggesting that the IFNGR subunits are recruited to lipid microdomains by IFN-gamma binding in lymphocytes (Jurkat) in contrast to their constitutive presence in epithelial (WISH) cells. In contrast, treatments that block clathrin-dependent endocytosis did not inhibit either activation or nuclear translocation of STAT1alpha or the nuclear translocation of IFN-gamma or IFNGR-1. Thus, membrane lipid microdomains play an important role in IFN-gamma-initiated endocytic events involving IFNGR-1, and the nuclear translocation of IFN-gamma, IFNGR-1, and STAT1alpha.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The functional loss of both alleles of the human pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene leads to a very rare syndrome of hypoadrenalism, red hair and early-onset obesity. In order to examine whether more subtle genetic variants in POMC might contribute to early-onset obesity, the coding region of the gene was sequenced in 262 Caucasian subjects with a history of severe obesity from childhood. Two children were found to be heterozygous for a missense mutation, R236G, which disrupts the dibasic cleavage site between beta melanocyte-stimulating hormone (beta-MSH) and beta-endorphin. Beta-TC3 cells transfected with the mutant POMC cDNA produced a mutant beta-MSH/beta-endorphin fusion protein. This fusion protein bound to the human melanocortin-4 receptor (hMC4R) with an affinity similar to its natural ligands, but had a markedly reduced ability to activate the receptor. This variant co-segregated with early-onset obesity over three generations in one family and was absent in 412 normal weight UK Caucasian controls. Combining the results in UK Caucasians with a new case-control study in French subjects and three previously published reports, mutations disrupting this processing site were present in 0.88% of subjects with early-onset obesity and 0.22% of normal-weight controls. These results suggest that the R236G mutation may confer an inherited susceptibility to obesity through the production of an aberrant fusion protein that has the capacity to interfere with central melanocortin signalling.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Two apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptors, the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor and apoE receptor 2 (apoER2), are also receptors for Reelin, a signaling protein that regulates neuronal migration during brain development. In the adult brain, Reelin is expressed by GABA-ergic interneurons, suggesting a potential function as a modulator of neurotransmission. ApoE receptors have been indirectly implicated in memory and neurodegenerative disorders because their ligand, apoE, is genetically associated with Alzheimer disease. We have used knockout mice to investigate the role of Reelin and its receptors in cognition and synaptic plasticity. Mice lacking either the VLDL receptor or the apoER2 show contextual fear conditioning deficits. VLDL receptor-deficient mice also have a moderate defect in long term potentiation (LTP), and apoER2 knockouts have a pronounced one. The perfusion of mouse hippocampal slices with Reelin has no effect on baseline synaptic transmission but significantly enhances LTP in area CA1. This Reelin-dependent augmentation of LTP is abolished in VLDL receptor and apoER2 knockout mice. Our results reveal a role for Reelin in controlling synaptic plasticity in the adult brain and suggest that both of its receptors are necessary for Reelin-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Thus, the impairment of apoE receptor-dependent neuromodulation may contribute to cognitive impairment and synaptic loss in Alzheimer disease.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a scavenger receptor that binds to many proteins, some of which trigger signal transduction. Receptor-recognized forms of alpha(2)-Macroglobulin (alpha(2)M*) bind to LRP, but the pattern of signal transduction differs significantly from that observed with other LRP ligands. For example, neither Ni(2+) nor the receptor-associated protein, which blocks binding of all known ligands to LRP, block alpha(2)M*-induced signal transduction. In the current study, we employed alpha(2)-macroglobulin (alpha(2)M)-agarose column chromatography to purify cell surface membrane binding proteins from 1-LN human prostate cancer cells and murine macrophages. The predominant binding protein purified from 1-LN prostate cancer cells was Grp 78 with small amounts of LRP, a fact that is consistent with our previous observations that there is little LRP present on the surface of these cells. The ratio of LRP:Grp 78 is much higher in macrophages. Flow cytometry was employed to demonstrate the presence of Grp 78 on the cell surface of 1-LN cells. Purified Grp 78 binds to alpha(2)M* with high affinity (K(d) approximately 150 pm). A monoclonal antibody directed against Grp 78 both abolished alpha(2)M*-induced signal transduction and co-precipitated LRP. Ligand blotting with alpha(2)M* showed binding to both Grp 78 and LRP heavy chains in these preparations. Use of RNA interference to silence LRP expression had no effect on alpha(2)M*-mediated signaling. We conclude that Grp 78 is essential for alpha(2)M*-induced signal transduction and that a \"co-receptor\" relationship exists with LRP like that seen with several other ligands and receptors such as the uPA/uPAR (urinary type plasminogen activator or urokinase/uPA receptor) system.',\n",

We now show that MMP-12 and other MMPs directly and efficiently cleave uPAR at the Thr86 paralal Tyr87 peptide bond located in the linker region connecting uPAR domains 1 and 2, releasing the major ligand binding domain 1 from the rest of the receptor. The possible biological importance of uPAR cleavage by MMPs is supported by the observation that also murine uPAR is cleaved by MMP-12 (at the Pro89 paralal Gln90 peptide bond), despite the limited sequence homology between the linker regions. Using an antibody raised against the human uPAR linker region we show that this region of uPAR, which contains the chemotactic SRSRY epitope, is exposed upon MMP cleavage.',\n",

It is likely that the first seven or so amino acids of CGRP (which form a disulphide-bonded loop) interact with the transmembrane domain of CRLR to cause receptor activation. The rest of the CGRP molecule falls into three domains. Residues 28-37 and 8-18 are normally required for high-affinity binding, while residues 19-27 form a hinge region. The 28-37 region is almost certainly in direct contact with the receptor; 8-18 may make additional receptor contacts or may stabilize an appropriate conformation of 28-37.

       "  'Abstract': 'Myelination of axons in the CNS by oligodendrocytes is a process critical to rapid and efficient impulse conduction. A new role for the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), the most abundant protein of CNS myelin, has been identified, in studies showing PLP interaction with signaling proteins in oligodendrocytes. In particular, these studies suggest that the PLP protein may be involved in signaling through integrins in oligodendrocytes. Stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on oligodendrocytes induced formation of a tripartite complex containing PLP, calreticulin, and alpha(v)-integrin. PLP interacted directly with the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha(v)-integrin. Complex formation was mediated by phospholipase C and Ca2+ binding to the high affinity binding site on calreticulin. This complex appears important for binding of fibronectin to oligodendrocytes. These data establish a novel function for PLP as a part of the integrin signaling complex in oligodendrocytes and suggest that neurotransmitter-mediated integrin receptor signaling may be involved in myelinogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Semaphorins are cell surface and soluble signals that control axonal guidance. Recently, semaphorin receptors (plexins) have been discovered and shown to be widely expressed. Their biological activities outside the nervous system and the signal transduction mechanism(s) they utilize are largely unknown. Here, we show that in epithelial cells, Semaphorin 4D (Sema 4D) triggers invasive growth, a complex programme that includes cell#150;cell dissociation, anchorage-independent growth and branching morphogenesis. Interestingly, the same response is also controlled by scatter factors through their tyrosine kinase receptors, which share striking structural homology with plexins in their extracellular domain. We found that in cells expressing the endogenous proteins, Plexin B1 (the Sema 4D Receptor) and Met (the Scatter Factor 1/ Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor) associate in a complex. In addition, binding of Sema 4D to Plexin B1 stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity of Met, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of both receptors. Finally, cells lacking Met expression do not respond to Sema 4D unless exogenous Met is expressed. This work identifies a novel biological function of semaphorins and suggests the involvement of an unexpected signalling mechanism, namely, the coupling of a plexin to a tyrosine kinase receptor.',\n",

Cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin, actin, and microtubule-associated proteins are also increased after aTf injection. In contrast, almost no changes are observed in myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) or in its mRNA or cholesterol. In the present study, we used brain-tissue slices and cell cultures highly enriched for oligodendroglia to investigate signaling pathways involved in the action of aTf, and to find out whether cytoskeletal integrity and dynamics were essential for its action upon the neural expression of certain genes. Treatment of brain-tissue slices with aTf produced a marked increase in the expression of MBP, CNPase, and tubulin mRNAs. Colchicine, cytochalasin, and taxol severely reduced the effect of aTf. Addition to cultures of an antibody against transferrin receptor (TfR), protein kinase inhibitors, or a cyclic AMP (cAMP) analogue showed that a functionally intact TfR was necessary, and that tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C and A, as well as calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase (Ca-CaMK) activities appeared to mediate aTf actions upon the expression of the above mentioned genes. Changes in the levels of phosphoinositides and cAMP induced by aTf in oligodendroglial cell (OLGc) cultures correlated with these results and coincide with an activation of the cyclic response element binding protein (CREB) and of mitogen activated protein kinases. The increased expression of certain myelin genes produced by aTf appear to be mediated by interaction of this glycoprotein with its receptor, by the cytoskeleton of the OLGc, and by a complex activation of protein kinases which lead to CREB phosphorylation.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The clearance and degradation of extracellular A beta is critical for regulating beta-amyloid deposition, a major hallmark of brains of patients with A beta in Alzheimer's Disease. The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, LRP1, is a large endocytic receptor that significantly contributes to the balance between degradation and production of A beta. An extracellular portion of the LRP, known as the cluster II region can bind to the secreted form of APP (sAPP-KPI). We show here that a GST fusion protein containing the cluster II region of LRP can be used as a 'mini-receptor' that specifically binds to sAPP-KPI from conditioned cultured medium. The binding between the GST-LRP-cluster II fusion protein and sAPP-KPI can be inhibited with the strong binding ligand of LRP1, called receptor-associated protein (RAP). Furthermore, a cell-based in vitro assay system has been developed to monitor the production of total A beta and A beta(1-42) in the presence and absence of RAP in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines both deficient in LRP and expressing LRP. A 3-day treatment of the L2 (CHO cells deficient in LRP and overexpressing APP751) and L3 (CHO cells expressing LRP and overexpressing APP751) cell lines with RAP showed a decrease in total A beta and, interestingly, also a decrease in the ratio of A beta42/A beta(total). This cell-based model system and LRP-cluster II mini-receptor will be very useful for screening novel compounds that can reduce A beta accumulation by inhibiting binding of APP-KPI to LRP1.\",\n",

Testing of MC2R activity is difficult because most cells express endogenous MCRs; hence, ACTH will elicit background activation of assayable reporter systems. Inactivating mutations of MC2R lead to hereditary unresponsiveness to ACTH, also known as familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD). These patients are usually seen in early childhood with very low cortisol concentrations, normal mineralocorticoids, hyperpigmentation, and increased bodily growth. Several MC2R mutations have been reported in FGD, but assays of the activities of these mutants are cumbersome. We saw two patients with typical clinical findings of FGD. Genetic analysis showed that patient 1 was homozygous for the mutation R137W, and patient 2 was a compound heterozygote for S74I and Y254C. We tested the activity of these mutations in OS-3 cells, which are unresponsive to ACTH but have intact downstream cAMP signal transduction. OS-3 cells transfected with a cAMP-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid (pCREluc) were unresponsive to ACTH, but cotransfection with a vector expressing human MC2R increased luciferase activity more than 40-fold. Addition of ACTH to cells cotransfected with the pCREluc reporter and wild-type MC2R activated luciferase expression with a 50% effective concentration of 5.5 x 10(-9) M ACTH, which is similar to previously reported values. By contrast, the MC2R mutant R137W had low activity, and the S74I or Y254C mutants elicited no measurable response. This assay provides excellent sensitivity in an easily assayed transient transfection system, providing a more rapid and efficient measurement of ACTH receptor activity.',\n",

A final stage of development, termed maturation, yields DCs that are strong stimulators of T cell-mediated immunity and is associated with a remodeling of the cell surface that includes a change in the levels of expression of many molecules, including chemokine receptors. We show in this study that CCR3, a chemokine receptor initially discovered on eosinophils, is also expressed by human DCs that differentiate from blood monocytes, DCs that emigrate from skin (epidermal and dermal DCs), and DCs derived from CD34+ hemopoietic precursors in bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, and cytokine-elicited peripheral blood leukapheresis. Unlike other chemokine receptors, such as CCR5 and CCR7, the expression of CCR3 is not dependent on the state of maturation. All DC subsets contain a large intracellular pool of CCR3. The surface expression of CCR3 is not modulated following uptake of particulate substances such as zymosan or latex beads. CCR3 mediates in vitro chemotactic responses to the known ligands, eotaxin and eotaxin-2, because the DC response to these chemokines is inhibited by CCR3-specific mAbs. We postulate that expression of CCR3 may underlie situations where both DCs and eosinophils accumulate in vivo, such as the lesions of patients with Langerhans cell granulomatosis.',\n",

Receptor activator of NFkB ligand (RANKL) is one of the key regulatory molecules in OC formation. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a novel secreted member of the TNF receptor superfamily that negatively regulates osteoclastogenesis and binds to RANKL. We examined the biological actions of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), RANKL, and OPG on the differentiation of OCs isolated from cocultures of mouse osteoblastic cells and bone marrow cells. Preosteoclasts (pOCs) and OCs were characterized by their ultrastructure and the expression of OC markers such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase. pOCs formed without any additives expressed TRAP, but showed little resorptive activity on cocultured dentine slices. TRAP-positive pOCs treated with M-CSF began to fuse with each other, but lacked a ruffled border (RB) and showed almost no resorptive activity. pOCs treated with RANKL became TRAP-positive multinucleated cells, which expressed intense vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase along the RB membranes and exhibited prominent resorptive activity. Such effects of RANKL on pOCs were completely inhibited by the addition of OPG. OPG inhibited RB formation in mature OCs and reduced their resorptive activity, and also induced apoptosis of some OCs. These results suggest that 1) RANKL induces differentiation of functional OCs from pOCs, 2) M-CSF induces macrophage-like multinucleated cells, but not OCs, 3) OPG inhibits RB formation and resorptive activity in mature OCs, 4) OPG also induces apoptosis of OCs, and 5) RANKL and OPG are, therefore, important regulators of not only the terminal differentiation of OCs but also their resorptive function.',\n",

Grb7 is an adaptor molecule implicated in the regulation of cell migration. Here we report identification of an interaction between Grb7 and the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 by using Grb7 as a \"bait\" in a yeast two-hybrid screening. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to confirm the interaction of Grb7 with the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 as well as the full-length receptor in intact cells. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of Grb7 and requires tyrosine autophosphorylation of EphB1. Furthermore, Tyr-928 of EphB1 was identified as the primary binding site for Grb7. Stimulation of endogenous EphB1 in embryonal carcinoma P19 cells with its ligand ephrinB1 increased its association with Grb7, which is consistent with a role for the autophosphorylation of EphB1. We also found that EphB1 could phosphorylate Grb7 and mutation of either Tyr-928 or Tyr-594 to Phe decreased this activity. Finally, we show that EphB1 could stimulate fibroblast motility on extracellular matrix in a kinase-dependent manner, which also correlated with its association with Grb7. Consistent with this, co-expression of Grb7 with EphB1 further enhanced cell motility, whereas co-expression of the Grb7 SH2 domain abolished EphB1-stimulated cell migration. Together, our results identified a novel interaction between EphB1 with the adaptor molecule Grb7 and suggested that this interaction may play a role in the regulation of cell migration by EphB1.',\n",

Both form heterodimeric RAMP/receptor complexes at the cell surface. This association represents a novel principle of G protein-coupled receptor function. RAMP1 is transported to the cell surface together with the CRLR or the CT receptor. Here, we have investigated the functional relevance of the short C-terminal intracellular tail QSKRTEGIV and of the single transmembrane domain of human (h) RAMP1 for their interactions with the hCRLR to constitute a CGRP receptor. To this end, hRAMP1 has been sequentially truncated from the C-terminus, and [(125)I]h alpha CGRP/hRAMP1/hCRLR association at the cell surface and cAMP accumulation in response to h alpha CGRP have been examined. With the C-terminal truncation of hRAMP1 by four amino acids wild-type hRAMP1 function was maintained, and the hCRLR was required for the transport of hRAMP1 to the cell surface. Further truncation of hRAMP1 through removal of the remaining five intracellular amino acids revealed CRLR-independent cell surface delivery but otherwise normal hRAMP1 activity. Sequential shortening of the hRAMP1 transmembrane domain resulted in progressively impaired association with the hCRLR and, as a consequence, abolished CGRP receptor function. In conclusion, the intracellular QSKRT sequence adjacent to the transmembrane domain of hRAMP1 provides a signal for intracellular retention. The sequence is unrelated to consensus endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval motives and overridden by the presence of the hCRLR. The entire single transmembrane domain of hRAMP1 together with one hydrophilic amino acid residue at its C-terminus is required for the formation of a fully functional CGRP/hRAMP1/hCRLR receptor complex.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The Lutheran blood group glycoprotein (Lu), also known as basal cell adhesion molecule, is an Ig superfamily transmembrane receptor for laminin alpha5. Lu is expressed on the surface of a subset of muscle and epithelial cells in diverse tissues and is thought to be involved in both normal and disease processes, including sickle cell disease and cancer. Here we investigated the binding of Lu to laminin alpha5 in vivo and in vitro. We prepared a soluble recombinant Lu (sol-Lu) composed of the Lu extracellular domain and a His(6) tag. Sol-Lu bound specifically to laminin-10/11 (alpha5beta1/beta2gamma1) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and bound to bona fide basement membranes containing laminin alpha5 in tissue sections. Sol-Lu did not bind to tissue sections of laminin alpha5 knockout embryos, despite the fact that the four other alpha chains were present. To identify the Lu-binding site on laminin alpha5, we prepared modified alpha5 cDNAs encoding chimeric laminins containing all or part of the laminin alpha1 G domain in place of the analogous alpha5 regions. These constructs were used to generate transgenic mice. Proteins derived from transgenes were detected in basement membranes and were assayed for their ability to bind Lu by examining the localization of endogenous Lu and the binding of sol-Lu applied to tissue sections. Our results demonstrate that the alpha5 LG3 module is essential for Lu binding to laminin alpha5.',\n",

By using a subclone of 293F cells with stable expression of XEDAR, we report that XEDAR activates the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. Treatment with EDA-A2 leads to the recruitment of TRAF3 and -6 to the aggregated XEDAR complex, suggesting a central role of these adaptors in the proximal aspect of XEDAR signaling. Whereas TRAF3 and -6, IKK1/IKKalpha, IKK2/IKKbeta, and NEMO/IKKgamma are involved in XEDAR-induced NF-kappaB activation, XEDAR-induced JNK activation seems to be mediated via a pathway dependent on TRAF3, TRAF6, and ASK1. Deletion and point mutagenesis studies delineate two distinct regions in the cytoplasmic domain of XEDAR, which are involved in binding to TRAF3 and -6, respectively, and play a major role in the activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways. Taken together, our results establish a major role of TRAF3 and -6 in XEDAR signaling and in the process of ectodermal differentiation.',\n",

In endothelial cells, TGF-beta binds to two distinct type I receptor serine-threonine kinases, ALK-5 and ALK-1; the latter activates the same R-Smads that are activated by BMP and induces synthesis of Id (inhibitor of differentiation or inhibitor of DNA binding) proteins.

The first identified Wnt signaling pathway, the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, has been studied in much detail and is highly conserved among species. As to non-canonical Wnt pathways, the current situation is more nebulous partly because the intracellular mediators of this pathway are not yet fully understood and, in some cases, even identified. However, there are increasing data that prove the existence of non-canonical Wnt signaling and demonstrate its involvement in different developmental processes. In vertebrates, Wnt-11 and Wnt-5A can activate the Wnt/JNK pathway, which resembles the planar cell polarity pathway in Drosophila. The Wnt/Ca(2+)-pathway has only been described in Xenopus and zebrafish so far and it is unclear whether it also exists in other organisms. Two recent papers provide us with new insight into non-canonical Wnt signaling by (1) presenting a new intracellular mediator of non-canonical signaling in Xenopus1 and (2) implicating the existence of an additional non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway in flies.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cytokines that signal through Class II receptors form a distinct family that includes the interferons and interleukin 10 (IL-10). Recent identification of several IL-10 homologs has defined a cytokine subfamily that includes AK155, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, and IL-24. Within this subfamily, IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 exhibit substantial sharing of receptor complexes; all three are capable of signaling through IL-20RA/IL-20RB, and IL-20 and IL-24 both can also use IL-22R/IL-20RB. However, the biological effects of these three cytokines appear quite distinct: immune activity with IL-19, skin biology with IL-20, and tumor apoptosis with IL-24. To more fully elucidate their interactions with the receptor complexes, we have performed a series of in vitro assays. Reporter, proliferation, and direct STAT activation assays using cell lines expressing transfected receptors revealed differences between the receptor complexes. IL-19 and IL-24 also exhibited growth inhibition on a cell line endogenously expressing all three receptor subunits, an effect that was seen at cytokine levels two orders of magnitude above those required for STAT activation or proliferation. These results demonstrate that, although this subclass exhibits receptor complex redundancy, there are differences in ligand/receptor interactions and in signal transduction that may lead to specificity and a distinct biology for each cytokine.',\n",

Previously it has been suggested that the remaining alpha(v) integrin, alpha(v)beta(3,) does not interact with LAPbeta(1). However, here we show clearly that alpha(v)beta(3) does indeed interact with the LAPbeta(1) RGD motif. This interaction is similar to other alpha(v)beta(3) ligands in terms of the cations required for adhesion, the concentrations of LAPbeta(1) required for binding and the ability of a small-molecule inhibitor of alpha(v)beta(3), SB223245, to block the interaction. Using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins we have mapped a minimal integrin-binding loop in LAPbeta(1) and then used this approach to probe the integrin-binding properties of the equivalent loops in LAPbeta(2) and LAPbeta(3). We show that the RGD motif of LAPbeta(3) also interacts with alpha(v)beta(3), in addition to alpha(v)beta(6), alpha(v)beta(1) and alpha(v)beta(5), whereas the corresponding loop in LAPbeta(2) does not interact with these integrins. These observations therefore correct a previously reported inaccuracy in the literature. Furthermore, they are important as they link alpha(v)beta(3) and TGFbeta, which may have implications in cancer and a number of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases where expression of both proteins has been documented.',\n",

These structurally diverse ligands specifically interact directly with recombinant human ALXR demonstrated by specific radioligand binding and function as well as immunoprecipitation of PMN receptors. In addition, the combination of both ATL and ANXA1-derived peptides limited PMN infiltration and reduced production of inflammatory mediators (that is, prostaglandins and chemokines) in vivo. Together, these results indicate functional redundancies in endogenous lipid and peptide anti-inflammatory circuits that are spatially and temporally separate, where both ATL and specific ANXA1-derived peptides act in concert at ALXR to downregulate PMN recruitment to inflammatory loci.',\n",

This cleavage is similar to the PS-dependent gamma-secretase cleavage of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP). However, topological differences in cleavage resulting in amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) or the Notch-1 intracellular domain (NICD) indicated independent mechanisms of proteolytic cleavage. We now demonstrate the secretion of an N-terminal Notch-1 Abeta-like fragment (Nbeta). Analysis of Nbeta by MALDI-TOF MS revealed that Nbeta is cleaved at a novel site (site-4, S4) near the middle of the transmembrane domain. Like the corresponding cleavage of betaAPP at position 40 and 42 of the Abeta domain, S4 cleavage is PS dependent. The precision of this cleavage is affected by familial Alzheimer's disease-associated PS1 mutations similar to the pathological endoproteolysis of betaAPP. Considering these similarities between intramembranous processing of Notch and betaAPP, we conclude that these proteins are cleaved by a common mechanism utilizing the same protease, i.e. PS/gamma-secretase.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neutrophil-independent macrophage responses are a prominent part of delayed-type immune and healing processes and depend on T cell-secreted cytokines. An important mediator in this setting is the phosphoprotein osteopontin, whose secretion by activated T cells confers resistance to infection by several intracellular pathogens through recruitment and activation of macrophages. Here, we analyze the structural basis of this activity following cleavage of the phosphoprotein by thrombin into two fragments. An interaction between the C-terminal domain of osteopontin and the receptor CD44 induces macrophage chemotaxis, and engagement of beta(3)-integrin receptors by a nonoverlapping N-terminal osteopontin domain induces cell spreading and subsequent activation. Serine phosphorylation of the osteopontin molecule on specific sites is required for functional interaction with integrin but not CD44 receptors. Thus, in addition to regulation of intracellular enzymes and substrates, phosphorylation also regulates the biological activity of secreted cytokines. These data, taken as a whole, indicate that the activities of distinct osteopontin domains are required to coordinate macrophage migration and activation and may bear on incompletely understood mechanisms of delayed-type hypersensitivity, wound healing, and granulomatous disease.',\n",

Although originally referred to as the MIP-1alpha/RANTES receptor, CCR1 is quite promiscuous and can be activated by numerous chemokines. We used radioligand binding and [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays in membranes from a cell line transfected to express CCR1 (Ba/F3-hCCR1) to characterize a panel of chemokines (HCC-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, MIP-1delta, MPIF-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and RANTES) as CCR1 ligands. In this recombinant model, these chemokines displaced 125I-MIP-1alpha with a wide range of potencies and, with the exception of MCP-2, acted as full agonists in stimulating [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange. We then assessed the utility of HL-60 cells cultured with known differentiating agents (PMA, DMSO, dibutyryl-cAMP or retinoic acid) for investigating CCR1 pharmacology. In [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, membranes from cells cultured with retinoic acid (4-6 days) were the most responsive to activation by MIP-1alpha and MPIF-1. FACS analysis and comparative pharmacology confirmed that these activities were mediated by CCR1. Using [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange assays, intracellular calcium flux and/or whole cell chemotaxis assays in HL-60(Rx) cells, we validated that MIP-1alpha was the most potent CCR1 ligand (MIP-1alpha>MPIF-1>RANTES>or=MIP-1beta) although the ligands differed in their efficacy as agonists. MPIF-1 was the more efficacious (MPIF-1>RANTES=MIP-1alpha>>MIP-1beta). 125I-MIP-1beta binding in Ba/F3-hCCR1 and HL-60(Rx) membranes was competitively displaced by MIP-1alpha, MPIF-1 and MIP-1beta. The binding K(i) for these chemokines with 125I-MIP-1beta were essentially identical in the two membrane systems. Lastly, MIP-1beta antagonized [35S]-GTPgammaS exchange, Ca2+ flux and chemotaxis in HL-60(Rx) cells in response to robust agonists such as MIP-1alpha, RANTES and MPIF-1. Based on our results, we propose that MIP-1beta could function as an endogenous inhibitor of CCR1 function.',\n",

It has by now been clearly established that the maturation of the glycoproteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum involves interactions with molecular chaperones, which promote the folding and assembly of the glycoproteins. In this study, we investigated whether calnexin (CNX), calreticulin (CRT) and BiP, three of the main molecular chaperones present in the endoplasmic reticulum, interact with the TSHR and what effects these interactions might have on the folding of the receptor. In the first set of experiments, we observed that in a K562 cell line expressing TSHR, about 50% of the receptor synthesized was degraded by the proteasome after ubiquitination. In order to determine whether TSHR interact with CNX, CRT and BiP, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. TSHR was found to be associated with all three molecular chaperones. To study the role of the interactions between CNX and CRT and the TSHR, we used castanospermine, a glucosidase I and II inhibitor that blocks the interactions between these chaperones and glycoproteins. In K562 cells expressing the TSHR, these drugs led to a faster degradation of the receptor, which indicates that these interactions contribute to stabilizing the receptor after its synthesis. The overexpression of calnexin and calreticulin in these cells stabilizes the receptor during the first hour after its synthesis, whereas the degradation of TSHR increased in a cell line overexpressing BiP and the quantity of TSHR able to acquire complex type oligosaccharides decreased. These results show that calnexin, calreticulin and BiP all interact with TSHR and that the choice made between these two chaperone systems is crucial because each of them has distinct effects on the folding and stability of this receptor at the endoplasmic reticulum level.',\n",

Two peptides, L8 and L8C, derived from a larger precursor, were recently described as natural ligands for GPR8 (Mori, M., Shimomura, Y., Harada, M., Kurihara, M., Kitada, C., Asami, T., Matsumoto, Y., Adachi, Y., Watanabe, T., Sugo, T., and Abe, M. (December, 27, 2001) World Patent Cooperation Treaty, Patent Application WO 01/98494A1). L8 is a 23-amino acid peptide, whereas L8C is the same peptide with a C terminus extension of 7 amino acids, running through a dibasic motif of proteolytic processing. Using as a query the amino acid sequence of the L8 peptide, we have identified in DNA databases a human gene predicted to encode related peptides and its mouse ortholog. By analogy with L8 and L8C, two peptides, named L7 and L7C could result from the processing of a 125-amino acid human precursor through the alternative usage of a dibasic amino acid motif. The activity of these four peptides was investigated on GPR7 and GPR8. In binding assays, L7, L7C, L8, and L8C were found to bind with low nanomolar affinities to the GPR7 and GPR8 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells. They inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation through a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. The tissue distribution of prepro-L7 (ppL7) and prepro-L8 (ppL8) was investigated by reverse transcription-PCR. Abundant ppL7 transcripts were found throughout the brain as well as in spinal cord, spleen, testis, and placenta; ppL8 transcripts displayed a more restricted distribution in brain, with high levels in substantia nigra, but were more abundant in peripheral tissues. The ppL7 and ppL8 genes therefore encode the precursors of a class of peptide ligands, active on two receptor subtypes, GPR7 and GPR8. The distinct tissue distribution of the receptor and peptide precursors suggest that each ligand and receptor has partially overlapping but also specific roles in this signaling system.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Vertebral bodies are segmented along the anteroposterior (AP) body axis, and the segmental identity of the vertebrae is determined by the unique expression pattern of multiple Hox genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family protein, Gdf11 (growth and differentiation factor 11), and the activin type II receptor, ActRIIB, are involved in controlling the spatiotemporal expression of multiple Hox genes along the AP axis, and that the disruption of each of these genes causes anterior transformation of the vertebrae. Skeletal defects are more severe in Gdf11-null mice than in ActRIIB-null mice, however, leaving it uncertain whether Gdf11 signals via ActRIIB. Here we demonstrate using genetic and biochemical studies that ActRIIB and its subfamily receptor, ActRIIA, cooperatively mediate the Gdf11 signal in patterning the axial vertebrae, and that Gdf11 binds to both ActRIIA and ActRIIB, and induces phosphorylation of Smad2. In addition, we also show that these two receptors can functionally compensate for one another to mediate signaling of another TGF-beta ligand, nodal, during left-right patterning and the development of anterior head structure.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CD97 is a recently identified seven-span transmembrane (7-TM) protein that is expressed by leukocytes early after activation. CD97 binds to its cellular ligand CD55 (decay accelerating factor), which protects several cell types from complement-mediated damage. The functional consequences of CD97-CD55 binding are largely unknown, but previous data imply that CD97-CD55 interactions play a role in cellular activation, migration, and adhesion under inflammatory conditions. Here we examined the expression of CD97 and CD55 by immunohistochemistry in multiple sclerosis (MS). On the basis of established criteria for inflammation and demyelination, different lesion stages were distinguished in MS post-mortem brain tissue. In normal white matter, CD97 expression was not found, but CD55 was expressed with weak staining intensity on endothelial cells. In pre-active lesions, defined by abnormalities of the white matter, many infiltrating T cells, macrophages (MPhi) and microglia expressed CD97. CD55 was highly expressed by endothelial cells. In active lesions with myelin degradation, MPhi and microglia expressed both CD55 and CD97. Furthermore, a sandwich ELISA showed significantly (p<0.05) elevated levels of soluble CD97 in serum but not in cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients (37%) compared to healthy controls (8%).Collectively, these data suggest that CD97-CD55 interactions are involved in the inflammatory processes in MS. CD55, which is expressed in lesions by vessels to protect against complement-mediated damage, might bind to CD97 on infiltrating leukocytes. This interaction may facilitate cell activation and migration through the blood-brain barrier. In addition, CD97-CD55 interactions in the parenchyma of the brain may contribute to the inflammation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP-15), an oocyte growth factor belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, has recently been shown to be necessary for normal female fertility in mammals. We have previously demonstrated that BMP-15 regulates granulosa cell (GC) proliferation and differentiation; namely, BMP-15 promotes GC mitosis, suppresses follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor expression, and stimulates kit ligand expression. Although the role of BMP-15 in female reproduction has progressively deserved much attention, there is nothing known to date about the signaling pathway and receptors for BMP-15. Using rat primary GCs and a human GC cell line, COV434, we have now found that administration of BMP-15 causes a rapid and transient phosphorylation, thus activation, of the Smad1/5/8 pathway. BMP-15 also stimulated promoter activity of a selective BMP-responsive reporter construct, further demonstrating the stimulation of Smad1/5/8 signaling by BMP-15. In contrast, BMP-15 stimulation of Smad2 phosphorylation was very weak. To identify the receptors for BMP-15, we utilized recombinant extracellular domains of individual transforming growth factor-beta superfamily receptors and found that activin receptor-like kinase-6 extracellular domain most effectively co-immunoprecipitates with BMP-15, whereas BMP receptor type II extracellular domain was most effective in inhibiting BMP-15 bioactivity on FSH-induced progesterone production and GC thymidine incorporation. We also investigated whether activation of the MAPK pathway is necessary for BMP-15 biological activity and found that the addition of U0126, an inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suppresses BMP-15 activity on GC mitotsis but not on FSH-induced progesterone production, suggesting a selective signaling cascade in GC proliferation and differentiation.',\n",

By using in vitro autoradiography with these radioligands and frog pancreatic polypeptide (PP) as selective unlabelled competitor of NPFF(2) binding sites, NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptor distribution was analyzed throughout the rat CNS. The highest densities of [(125)I]EYF binding sites were seen in the most external layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the parafascicular thalamic nucleus, laterodorsal thalamic nucleus and presubiculum of hippocampus. All specific binding of this radioligand was inhibited by 200 nM frog PP.

The restricted distribution of NPFF(1) receptors in the CNS supports its specific role in a limited number of neuronal functions.

       "  'Title': 'Characterization of the role of the N-loop of MIP-1 beta in CCR5 binding.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': \"MIP-1beta is a CC-chemokine that plays a role in inflammation and host defense mechanisms by interacting with its specific receptor CCR5. CCR5 is a major coreceptor for macrophage-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and as a consequence, MIP-1beta can inhibit HIV entry. It is therefore of interest to understand how MIP-1beta and other CCR5 ligands bind to their receptor, as such understanding could lead to the rational design of more efficient HIV entry blockers. We have previously demonstrated the importance of Phe13, and of basic residues of the 40's loop, in mediating high-affinity binding of MIP-1beta to CCR5. We have now investigated further the relative contribution of other MIP-1beta residues in the interaction of the chemokine with CCR5, by studying the functional consequences of point mutations within the N-loop and the 3(10) turn of MIP-1beta, affecting the charge, size, and H-bonding properties of the side chains. Our data suggest that, in addition to Phe13, three amino acids of the N-loop and 3(10) turn (Arg18, Lys19, and Arg22) interact with CCR5 through their positive charge. We also found that Pro21 contributes to the CCR5 binding properties of MIP-1beta. Moreover, NMR spectroscopy has revealed that the presence of Tyr at position 15 is necessary for the proper folding of the chemokine. Our results therefore demonstrate that the binding determinants of MIP-1beta consist of residues arranged on one surface of the protein, including most of the basic residues in MIP-1beta, as well as two key hydrophobic groups. The good correlation observed between the potency of the mutants in a functional assay and their binding affinity strongly argues that basic residues Arg18, Lys19, and Arg22 of MIP-1beta are essential for its CCR5 binding properties, without a primary effect on CCR5 activation.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) have been identified as ligands with different effector functions of the vascular assembly and maturation-mediating receptor tyrosine kinase Tie-2. To understand the molecular interactions of the angiopoietins with their receptor, we have studied the binding of Ang-1 and Ang-2 to the Tie-2 receptor. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based competition assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments analyzing the binding of Ang-1 and Ang-2 to truncation mutants of the extracellular domain of Tie-2 showed that the first Ig-like loop of Tie-2 in combination with the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (amino acids 1-360) is required for angiopoietin binding. The first Ig-like domain or the EGF-like repeats alone are not capable of binding Ang-1 and Ang-2. Concomitantly, we made the surprising finding that Tie-2 exon-2 knockout mice do express a mutated Tie-2 protein that lacks 104 amino acids of the first Ig-like domain. This mutant Tie-2 receptor is functionally inactive as shown by the lack of ligand binding and receptor phosphorylation. Collectively, the data show that the first 104 amino acids of the Tie-2 receptor are essential but not sufficient for angiopoietin binding. Conversely, the first 360 amino acids (Ig-like domain plus EGF-like repeats) of the Tie-2 receptor are necessary and sufficient to bind both Ang-1 and Ang-2, which suggests that differential receptor binding is not likely to be responsible for the different functions of Ang-1 and Ang-2.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Previous studies have shown that human fetal adrenal gland from 17- to 20-week-old fetuses expressed pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptors, which were localized on chromaffin cells. The aim of the present study was to identify PACAP receptor isoforms and to determine whether PACAP can affect intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and catecholamine secretion. Using primary cultures and specific stimulation of chromaffin cells, we demonstrate that PACAP-38 induced an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) that was blocked by PACAP (6-38), was independent of external Ca(2+), and originated from thapsigargin-insensitive internal stores. The PACAP-triggered Ca(2+) increase was not affected by inhibition of PLC beta (preincubation with U-73122) or by pretreatment of cells with Xestospongin C, indicating that the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive stores were not mobilized. However, forskolin (FSK), which raises cytosolic cAMP, induced an increase in Ca(2+) similar to that recorded with PACAP-38. Blockage of PKA by H-89 or (R(p))-cAMPS suppressed both PACAP-38 and FSK calcium responses. The effect of PACAP-38 was also abolished by emptying the caffeine/ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) stores. Furthermore, treatment of cells with orthovanadate (100 microm) impaired Ca(2+) reloading of PACAP-sensitive stores indicating that PACAP-38 can mobilize Ca(2+) from secretory vesicles. Moreover, PACAP induced catecholamine secretion by chromaffin cells. It is concluded that PACAP-38, through the PAC(1) receptor, acts as a neurotransmitter in human fetal chromaffin cells inducing catecholamine secretion, through nonclassical, recently described, ryanodine/caffeine-sensitive pools, involving a cAMP- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation mechanism.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive and potent disease, which is largely resistant to conventional forms of treatment. However, the discovery of antigens associated with pancreatic cancer cells has recently suggested the possibility that immunotherapy might become a specific and effective therapeutic option. T cells within many epithelia, including those of the pancreas, are known to express the alphaEbeta7-integrin adhesion molecule, CD103. The only characterised ligand for CD103 is E-cadherin, an epithelial adhesion molecule which exhibits reduced expression in pancreatic cancer. In our study, CD103 was found to be expressed only by activated T cells following exposure to tumour necrosis factor beta 1, a factor produced by many cancer cells. Significantly, the expression of this integrin was restricted mainly to class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD8+ T cells. The human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 was transfected with human E-cadherin in order to generate E-cadherin negative (wild type) and positive (transfected) sub-lines. Using a sensitive flow cytometric adhesion assay it was found that the expression of both CD103 (on T cells) and E-cadherin (on cancer cells) was essential for efficient adhesion of activated T cells to pancreatic cancer cells. This adhesion process was inhibited by the addition of antibodies specific for CD103, thereby demonstrating the importance of the CD103-->E-cadherin interaction for T-cell adhesion. Using a 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assay it was found that CD103 expressing T cells lysed E-cadherin expressing Panc-1 target cells following T cell receptor stimulation; addition of antibodies specific for CD103 significantly reduced this lysis. Furthermore, absence of either CD103 from the T cells or E-cadherin expression from the cancer cells resulted in a significant reduction in cancer cell lysis. Therefore, potentially antigenic pancreatic cancer cells could evade a local anti-cancer immune response in vivo as a consequence of their loss of E-cadherin expression; this phenotypic change may also favour metastasis by reducing homotypic adhesion between adjacent cancer cells. We conclude that effective immunotherapy is likely to require upregulation of E-cadherin expression by pancreatic cancer cells or the development of cytotoxic immune cells that are less dependent on this adhesion molecule for efficient effecter function.',\n",

In this study, we describe the synthesis and pharmacological properties of [1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] arginine vasopressin (d[Cha4]AVP). Binding experiments performed on various membrane preparations revealed that d[Cha(4)]AVP exhibits a nanomolar affinity for V1b receptors from various mammalian species (rat, bovine, human). It exhibits high V1b/V1a and V1b/oxytocin selectivity for rat, human, and bovine receptors. Furthermore, it exhibits high V1b/V2 specificity for both bovine and human vasopressin receptors. Functional studies performed on biological models that naturally express V1b receptors indicate that d[Cha4]AVP is an agonist. Like VP, it stimulated basal and corticotropin-releasing factor-stimulated ACTH secretion and basal catecholamine release from rat anterior pituitary and bovine chromaffin cells, respectively. In vivo experiments performed in rat revealed that d[Cha4]AVP was able to stimulate both ACTH and corticosterone secretion and exhibits negligible vasopressor activity. It retains about 30% of the antidiuretic activity of VP. This long-sought selective VP V1b receptor ligand with nanomolar affinity will allow a better understanding of V1b-mediated VP physiological effects and is a promising new tool for V1b receptor structure-function studies.',\n",

Binding of this preparation to cultured human hepatic cells was both dose dependent and saturable.

Uptake by hepatocytes was observed with both radiolabeled and dye-labeled HCV structural proteins. With hepatocytes expressing the hH1 subunit of the ASGP-R fused to green fluorescent protein, we could show by confocal microscopy that dye stain cointernalized with the fusion protein in an area surrounding the nucleus. Internalization was more efficient with a preparation containing p7 than with one that did not. The two preparations bound to transfected 3T3-L1 cells expressing either both (hH1 and hH2) subunits of the ASGP-R (3T3-22Z cells) or both hH1 and a functionally defective variant of hH2 (3T3-24X cells) but not to parental cells. Additionally, uptake of dye-labeled preparation containing p7 was observed with 3T3-22Z cells but not with 3T3-L1 or 3T3-24X cells or with the preparation lacking p7, suggesting that p7 regulates the internalization properties of HCV structural proteins.

       "  'Abstract': 'Notch receptors are single transmembrane receptors that contain a large number of epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGF repeats) in their extracellular domains. Mutations in the EGF repeats of the human Notch 3 receptor lead to the vascular dementia disease Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). The vast majority of CADASIL mutations are missense mutations removing or inserting cysteine residues in the EGF repeats, but it is not yet clear whether these mutations primarily affect receptor trafficking, maturation, andor signaling. To address this issue, we have generated and analyzed stable cell lines expressing either wild-type murine Notch 3 (mNotch 3) or the mutant mNotch 3(R142C), which corresponds to the prevalent CADASIL form of Notch 3, Notch 3(R141C) in humans. We find that a lower proportion of mNotch 3(R142C) is expressed in the site 1-cleaved configuration, and that reduced amounts of mNotch 3(R142C) appear at the cell surface, as compared with wild-type mNotch 3. This observation is accompanied by a higher propensity for mNotch 3(R142C) to form intracellular aggregates, which may be a result of increased accumulation or slowed transport in the secretory pathway. In contrast to the impaired cell surface expression, mNotch 3(R142C) signals equally well in response to Delta 1 and Jagged 1 as wild-type mNotch 3. Taken together, these data suggest that trafficking and localization rather than signaling of mNotch 3 are affected in mNotch 3(R142C).',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Fringe plays a key role in the specification of boundaries during development by modulating the ability of Notch ligands to activate Notch receptors. Fringe is a fucose-specific beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that modifies O-fucose moieties on the epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of Notch. To investigate how the change in sugar structure caused by Fringe modulates Notch activity, we have analyzed the sites of O-fucose and Fringe modification on mouse Notch1. The extracellular domain of Notch1 has 36 tandem EGF repeats, many of which are predicted to be modified with O-fucose. We recently proposed a broadened consensus sequence for O-fucose, C(2)X(3-5)(S/T)C(3) (where C(2) and C(3) represent the second and third conserved cysteines), significantly expanding the potential number of modification sites on Notch. Here we demonstrate that sites predicted using this broader consensus sequence are modified with O-fucose on mouse Notch1, and we present evidence suggesting that the consensus can be further refined to C(2)X(4-5)(S/T)C(3). In particular, we demonstrate that EGF 12, a portion of the ligand-binding site, is modified with O-fucose and that this site is evolutionarily conserved. We also show that endogenous Fringe proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Lunatic fringe and Radical fringe) as well as exogenous Manic fringe modify O-fucose on many but not all EGF repeats of mouse Notch1. These findings suggest that the Fringes show a preference for O-fucose on some EGF repeats relative to others.

       "  'Abstract': 'Inhibins are endogenous antagonists of activin signaling, long recognized as important regulators of gonadal function and pituitary FSH release. Inhibin, in concert with its co-receptor, betaglycan, can compete with activin for binding to type II activin receptors and, thus, prevent activin signaling. Because bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) also utilize type II activin receptors, we hypothesized that BMP signaling might also be sensitive to inhibin blockade. Here we show that inhibin blocks cellular responses to diverse BMP family members in a variety of BMP-responsive cell types. Inhibin abrogates BMP-induced Smad signaling and transcription responses. Inhibin competes with BMPs for type II activin receptors, and this competition is facilitated by betaglycan. Betaglycan also enables inhibin to bind to and compete with BMPs for binding to the BMP-specific type II receptor BMPRII, which does not bind inhibin in the absence of betaglycan. Betaglycan can confer inhibin responsiveness on cells that are otherwise insensitive to inhibin. These findings demonstrate that inhibin, acting through betaglycan, can function as an antagonist of BMP responses, suggesting a broader role for inhibin and betaglycan in restricting and refining a wide spectrum of transforming growth factor beta superfamily signals.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Communication between glial cells and neurons is emerging as a critical parameter of synaptic function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of glial cells to modify synaptic structure and physiology are poorly understood. Here we describe a repulsive interaction that regulates postsynaptic morphology through the EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand ephrin-A3. EphA4 is enriched on dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the adult mouse hippocampus, and ephrin-A3 is localized on astrocytic processes that envelop spines. Activation of EphA4 by ephrin-A3 was found to induce spine retraction, whereas inhibiting ephrin/EphA4 interactions distorted spine shape and organization in hippocampal slices. Furthermore, spine irregularities in pyramidal neurons from EphA4 knockout mice and in slices transfected with kinase-inactive EphA4 indicated that ephrin/EphA4 signaling is critical for spine morphology. Thus, our data support a model in which transient interactions between the ephrin-A3 ligand and the EphA4 receptor regulate the structure of excitatory synaptic connections through neuroglial cross-talk.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Leucine-rich repeat-containing, G protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) represent a unique subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors with a large ectodomain. Recent studies demonstrated that relaxin activates two orphan LGRs, LGR7 and LGR8, whereas INSL3/Leydig insulin-like peptide specifically activates LGR8. Human relaxin 3 (H3 relaxin) was recently discovered as a novel ligand for relaxin receptors. Here, we demonstrate that H3 relaxin activates LGR7 but not LGR8. Taking advantage of the overlapping specificity of these three ligands for the two related LGRs, chimeric receptors were generated to elucidate the mechanism of ligand activation of LGR7. Chimeric receptor LGR7/8 with the ectodomain from LGR7 but the transmembrane region from LGR8 maintains responsiveness to relaxin but was less responsive to H3 relaxin based on ligand stimulation of cAMP production. The decreased ligand signaling was accompanied by decreases in the ability of H3 relaxin to compete for (33)P-relaxin binding to the chimeric receptor. However, replacement of the exoloop 2, but not exoloop 1 or 3, of LGR7 to the chimeric LGR7/8 restored ligand binding and receptor-mediated cAMP production. These results suggested that activation of LGR7 by H3 relaxin involves specific binding of the ligand to both the ectodomain and the exoloop 2, thus providing a model with which to understand the molecular basis of ligand signaling for this unique subgroup of G protein-coupled receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) comprise a large family of multidomain proteins with cell-binding and metalloprotease activities. The ADAM12 cysteine-rich domain (rADAM12-cys) supports cell attachment using syndecan-4 as a primary cell surface receptor that subsequently triggers beta(1) integrin-dependent cell spreading, stress fiber assembly, and focal adhesion formation. This process contrasts with cell adhesion on fibronectin, which is integrin-initiated but syndecan-4-dependent. In the present study, we investigated ADAM12/syndecan-4 signaling leading to cell spreading and stress fiber formation. We demonstrate that syndecan-4, when present in significant amounts, promotes beta(1) integrin-dependent cell spreading and stress fiber formation in response to rADAM12-cys. A mutant form of syndecan-4 deficient in protein kinase C (PKC)alpha activation or a different member of the syndecan family, syndecan-2, was unable to promote cell spreading. GF109203X and GÃ¶6976, inhibitors of PKC, completely inhibited ADAM12/syndecan-4-induced cell spreading. Expression of syndecan-4, but not syn4DeltaI, resulted in the accumulation of activated beta(1) integrins at the cell periphery in Chinese hamster ovary beta1 cells as revealed by 12G10 staining. Further, expression of myristoylated, constitutively active PKCalpha resulted in beta(1) integrin-dependent cell spreading, but additional activation of RhoA was required to induce stress fiber formation. In summary, these data provide novel insights into syndecan-4 signaling. Syndecan-4 can promote cell spreading in a beta(1) integrin-dependent fashion through PKCalpha and RhoA, and PKCalpha and RhoA likely function in separate pathways.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Agonist exposure of many G protein-coupled receptors induces a rapid receptor phosphorylation and uncoupling from G proteins. Resensitization of these desensitized receptors requires endocytosis and subsequent dephosphorylation. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, the rat mu-opioid receptor (MOR1, also termed MOP) was found to be associated with phospholipase D2 (PLD2), a phospholipid-specific phosphodiesterase located in the plasma membrane, which has been implicated in the formation of endocytotic vesicles. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells coexpressing MOR1 and PLD2 confirmed that MOR1 constitutively interacts with PLD2. Treatment with the mu receptor agonist DAMGO ([d-Ala(2), Me Phe(4), Glyol(5)]enkephalin) led to an increase in PLD2 activity, whereas morphine, which does not induce MOR1 receptor internalization, failed to induce PLD2 activation. The DAMGO-mediated PLD2 activation was inhibited by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) but not by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C indicating that opioid receptor-mediated activation of PLD2 is ARF- but not PKC-dependent. Furthermore, heterologous stimulation of PLD2 by phorbol ester led to an accelerated internalization of the mu-opioid receptor after both DAMGO and morphine exposure. Conversely the inhibition of PLD2-mediated phosphatidic acid formation by 1-butanol or overexpression of a negative mutant of PLD2 prevented agonist-mediated endocytosis of MOR1. Together, these data suggest that PLD2 play a key role in the regulation of agonist-induced endocytosis of the mu-opioid receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is an endocytic receptor that binds multiple distinct ligands, including blood coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). FVIII is a heterodimeric multidomain protein that consists of a heavy chain (domains A1, a1, A2, a2, and B) and a light chain (domains a3, A3, C1, and C2). Both chains contribute to high-affinity interaction with LRP. One LRP-interactive region has previously been located in the C2 domain, but its affinity is low in comparison with that of the entire FVIII light chain. We now have compared a variety of FVIII light chain derivatives with the light chain of its homolog FVa for LRP binding. In surface plasmon resonance studies employing LRP cluster II, the FVa and FVIII light chains proved different in that only FVIII displayed high-affinity binding. Because the FVIII a3-A3-C1 fragment was effective in associating with LRP, this region was explored for structural elements that are exposed but not conserved in FV. Competition studies using synthetic peptides suggested that LRP binding involves the FVIII-specific region Lys(1804)-Ala(1834) in the A3 domain. In line with this observation, LRP binding was inhibited by a recombinant antibody fragment that specifically binds to the FVIII sequence Glu(1811)-Lys(1818). The role of this sequence in LRP binding was further tested using a FVIII/FV chimera in which sequence Glu(1811)-Lys(1818) was replaced with the corresponding sequence of FV. Although this chimera still displayed residual binding to LRP cluster II, its affinity was reduced. This suggests that multiple sites in FVIII contribute to high-affinity LRP binding, one of which is the FVIII A3 domain region Glu(1811)-Lys(1818). This suggests that LRP binding to the FVIII A3 domain involves the same structural elements that also contribute to the assembly of FVIII with FIXa.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'When blood coagulation factor IX is converted to activated factor IX (factor IXa), it develops enzymatic activity and exposes the binding sites for both activated factor VIII and the endocytic receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). In the present study we investigated the interaction between factor IXa and LRP in more detail, using an affinity-purified soluble form of LRP (sLRP). Purified sLRP and full-length LRP displayed similar binding to factor IXa. An anti-factor IX monoclonal antibody CLB-FIX 13 inhibited factor IXa.sLRP complex formation. Both the antibody and a soluble recombinant fragment of LRP (i.e. cluster IV) interfered with factor IXa amidolytic activity, suggesting that the antibody and LRP share similar binding regions near the active site of factor IXa. Next, a panel of recombinant factor IXa variants with amino acid replacements in the surface loops bordering the active site was tested for binding to antibody CLB-FIX 13 and sLRP in a solid phase binding assay. Factor IXa variants with mutations in the region Phe(342)-Asn(346), located between the active site of factor IXa and factor VIII binding helix, showed reduced binding to both antibody CLB-FIX 13 and sLRP. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the variant with Asn(346) replaced by Asp displayed slower association to sLRP, whereas the variant with residues Phe(342)-Tyr(345) replaced by the corresponding residues of thrombin showed faster dissociation. Recombinant soluble LRP fragment cluster IV inhibited factor IXa-mediated activation of factor X with IC(50) values of 5 and 40 nm in the presence and absence of factor VIII, respectively. This inhibition thus seems to occur via two mechanisms: by interference with factor IXa.factor VIIIa complex assembly and by direct inhibition of factor IXa enzymatic activity. Accordingly, we propose that LRP may function as a regulator of blood coagulation.',\n",

The related Dkk2, however, can function either as LRP6 agonist or antagonist, depending on the cellular context, suggesting that its activity is modulated by unknown co-factors. We have recently identified the transmembrane proteins Kremen1 and -2 as additional Dkk receptors, which bind to both Dkk1 and Dkk2 with high affinity. Here we show that Kremen2 (Krm2) regulates Dkk2 activity during Wnt signaling. In human 293 fibroblasts transfected dkk2 activates LRP6 signaling. However, co-transfection of krm2 blocks the ability of Dkk2 to activate LRP6 and enhances inhibition of Wnt/Frizzled signaling. Krm2 also co-operates with Dkk4 to inhibit Wnt signaling, but not with Dkk3, which has no effect on Wnt signaling. Likewise, in Xenopus embryos, Dkk2 and Krm2 co-operate in Wnt inhibition leading to anteriorized embryos. Finally, we show that interaction with Krm2 is mediated by the second cysteine-rich domain of Dkks. These results suggest that Krm2 can function as a switch that turns Dkk2 from an activator into an inhibitor of Wnt/lRP6 signaling.',\n",

In the present paper, we report that the human TWEAK extracellular domain can also bind the murine Fn14 protein. Furthermore, site-specific mutagenesis and directed yeast two-hybrid interaction assays revealed that the TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) 1, 2, 3 and 5 adaptor molecules bind the murine Fn14 cytoplasmic tail at an overlapping, but non-identical, amino acid sequence motif. We also found that TWEAK treatment of quiescent NIH 3T3 cells stimulates inhibitory kappaBalpha phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) enhancer/luciferase reporter construct. Fn14 overexpression in transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells also promotes NF-kappaB activation, and this cellular response requires an intact TRAF binding site. These results indicate that Fn14 is a functional TWEAK receptor that can associate with four distinct TRAF family members and stimulate the NF-kappaB transcription factor signalling pathway.',\n",

An amylin/CGRP receptor was recognized when a calcitonin receptor (CTR) was coexpressed with RAMP1. In the presence of RAMP3, the CTR only interacts with amylin. Noncovalent association of the RAMP with the CRLR or the CTR reveals heterodimeric RAMP/receptor complexes at the cell surface. Thus, two Class II G protein-coupled receptors, the CRLR and CTR, associate with three RAMP to form high affinity receptors for CGRP, ADM, or amylin.

(1995) Biochemistry 34, 2130-2136) that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) stabilizes a dimeric form of the natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA) by simultaneously interacting with both receptor subunits. However, the first crystallographic study of unliganded NPRA extracellular domain documented a V-shaped dimer involving a membrane-proximal dimer interface and separate binding sites for ANP on each monomer. We explored the possibility of an alternative A-shaped dimer involving a membrane-distal dimer interface by substituting an unpaired solvent-exposed cysteine for Trp(74) in the amino-terminal lobe of full-length NPRA. The predicted spacing between Trp(74) from both subunits drastically differs, depending on whether the V-shaped (84 A) or the A-shaped (8 A) dimer model is considered. In contrast with the expected results for the reported V-shaped dimer, the NPRA(W74C) mutant was constitutively covalently dimeric. Also, the subunits spontaneously reassociated following transient disulfide reduction by dithiothreitol and reoxidation. However, ANP could neither bind to nor activate NPRA(W74C). Permanent disulfide opening by reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide rescued ANP binding to NPRA(W74C). The NPRA mutant could be maintained as a covalent dimer while preserving its function by crosslinking with the bifunctional alkylating agent phenylenedimaleimides (PDM), the ortho-substituted oPDM being more efficient than mPDM or pPDM. These results indicate that the membrane-distal lobe of the NPRAM extracellular domains are dynamically interfacing in the unliganded state and that ANP binding stabilizes the receptor dimer with more stringent spacing at the dimer interface.',\n",

Using reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the four isoforms of preprotachykinin-A gene transcripts (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) were detected in the NT2-N. We also identified the presence of mRNA for neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), a primary receptor for SP, in the NT2-N cells. Concomitant with NT2 cell differentiation into neurons, SP and NK-1R mRNA expression increased consistently. Intracellular SP and cell membrane NK-1R immunoreactivity were all observed in NT2-N cells.

Mutual cross-desensitization between CCL2 and vCCL4 was demonstrated in the CCR2-transfected cells.

In the murine pre-B lymphocyte cell line L1.2 stably transfected with the CCR2 receptor, vCCL4 acted as a relatively low potency but highly efficacious chemoattractant being equally or more efficacious in causing cell migration than CCL2 and CCL7 and considerably more efficacious than CCL8 and CCL13. It is concluded that human herpesvirus 6 encodes a highly selective and efficacious CCR2 agonist, which will attract CCR2 expressing cells, for example macrophages and monocytes, conceivably for the virus to infect and to establish latency in.

To translate these findings in in vivo settings, we have used an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) procedure to promote leukocyte-endothelium interactions in the mouse mesenteric microcirculation. In naive mice, the annexin 1 mimetic peptide Ac2-26 (20 to 100 microg administered intravenously prior to reperfusion) abolished I/R-induced cell adhesion and emigration, but not cell rolling. In FPR-deficient mice, peptide Ac2-26 retained significant inhibitory actions (about 50% of the effects in naive mice), and these were blocked by an FPR antagonist, termed butyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe, or Boc2. In vitro, neutrophils taken from these animals could be activated at high concentrations of formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (30 microM; fMLP), and this effect was blocked by cell incubation with peptide Ac2-26 (66 microM) or Boc2 (100 microM). FPR-deficient neutrophils expressed ALXR mRNA and protein. Both ALXR agonists, lipoxin A(4) and peptide Ac2-26, provoked detachment of adherent leukocytes in naive as well as in FPR-deficient mice, whereas the CXC chemokine KC or fMLP were inactive.

       "  'Abstract': 'We tested whether heterodimers comprised of calcitonin (CT) receptor lacking the 16-amino acid insert in intracellular domain 1 (CTR(I1-)) and receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) can function not only as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors but also as adrenomedullin (AM) receptors. Whether transfected alone or together with RAMP, human (h)CTR(I1-) appeared mainly at the surface of HEK-293 cells. Expression of CTR(I1-) alone led to significant increases in cAMP in response to hCGRP or hAM, though both peptides remained about 100-fold less potent than hCT. However, the apparent potency of AM, like that of CGRP, approached that of CT when CTR(I1-) was co-expressed with RAMP. CGRP- or AM-evoked cAMP production was strongly inhibited by salmon CT-(8-32), a selective amylin receptor antagonist, but not by hCGRP-(8-37) or hAM-(22-52), antagonists of CGRP and AM receptors, respectively. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of CT-(8-32) were much stronger in cells co-expressing CTR(I1-) and RAMP than in cells expressing CTR(I1-) alone. Co-expression of CTR(I1-) with RAMP thus appears to produce functional CT-(8-32)-sensitive AM receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The chemokine IP-10 (interferon-inducible protein of 10 kDa, CXCL10) binds the G protein-coupled receptor CXCR3, which is found mainly on activated T cells and NK cells, and plays an important role in Th1-type inflammatory diseases. IP-10 also binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), an interaction thought to be important for its sequestration on endothelial and other cells. In this study, we performed an extensive mutational analysis to identify the CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of murine IP-10. The mutants were characterized for heparin binding, CXCR3 binding, and the ability to induce chemotaxis, Ca(2+) flux, and CXCR3 internalization. Double mutations neutralizing adjacent basic residues at the C terminus did not lead to a significant reduction in heparin binding, indicating that the main heparin binding site of IP-10 is not along the C-terminal alpha helix. Alanine exchange of Arg-22 had the largest effect on heparin binding, with residues Arg-20, Ile-24, Lys-26, Lys-46, and Lys-47 further contributing to heparin binding. A charge change mutation of Arg-22 resulted in further reduction in heparin binding. The N-terminal residue Arg-8, preceding the first cysteine, was critical for CXCR3 signaling. Mutations of charged and uncharged residues in the loop regions of residues 20-24 and 46-47, which caused reduced heparin binding, also resulted in reduced CXCR3 binding and signaling. CXCR3 expressing GAG-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed that GAG binding was not required for IP-10 binding and signaling through CXCR3, which suggests that the CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of IP-10 are partially overlapping.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Thrombin acts on many protein substrates during the hemostatic process. Its specificity for these substrates is modulated through interactions at regions remote from the active site of the thrombin molecule, designated exosites. Exosite interactions can be with the substrate, cofactors such as thrombomodulin, or fragments from prothrombin. The relative activity of alpha-thrombin for fibrinogen is 10 times greater than that for protein C. However, the relative activity of meizothrombin for protein C is 14 times greater than that for fibrinogen. Modulation of thrombin specificity is linked to its Na(+)-binding site and residues in autolytic loop-2 that interact with the Na(+)-binding site. Recombinant prothrombins that yield recombinant meizothrombin (rMT) and rMT des-fragment 1 (rMT(desF1)) enable comparisons of the effects of mutations at the Na(+)-binding residue (Asp(554)) and deletion of loop-2 (Glu(466)-Thr(469)) on the relative activity of meizothrombin for several substrates. Hydrolysis of t-butoxycarbonyl-VPR-p-nitroanilide by alpha-thrombin, recombinant alpha-thrombin, or rMT(desF1) was almost identical, but that by rMT was only 40% of that by alpha-thrombin. Clotting of fibrinogen by rMT and rMT(desF1) was 12-16% of that by alpha-thrombin, as already known. Strikingly, however, although meizothrombins modified by substitution of Asp(554) with either Ala or Leu or by deletion of loop-2 had 6-8 and <1%, respectively, of the clotting activity of alpha-thrombin, the activity of these meizothrombins for protein C was increased to >10 times that of alpha-thrombin. It is proposed that interactions within thrombin that involve autolytic loop-2 and the Na(+)-binding site primarily enhance thrombin action on fibrinogen, but impair thrombin action on protein C.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Binding specificity between fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) is essential for mammalian development and is regulated primarily by two alternatively spliced exons, IIIb (\"b\") and IIIc (\"c\"), that encode the second half of Ig-like domain 3 (D3) of FGFRs. FGF7 and FGF10 activate only the b isoform of FGFR2 (FGFR2b). Here, we report the crystal structure of the ligand-binding portion of FGFR2b bound to FGF10. Unique contacts between divergent regions in FGF10 and two b-specific loops in D3 reveal the structural basis by which alternative splicing provides FGF10-FGFR2b specificity. Structure-based mutagenesis of FGF10 confirms the importance of the observed contacts for FGF10 biological activity. Interestingly, FGF10 binding induces a previously unobserved rotation of receptor Ig domain 2 (D2) to introduce specific contacts with FGF10. Hence, both D2 and D3 of FGFR2b contribute to the exceptional specificity between FGF10 and FGFR2b. We propose that ligand-induced conformational change in FGFRs may also play an important role in determining specificity for other FGF-FGFR complexes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor comprises the low affinity binding chain gp190 and the high affinity converter gp130. The ectodomain of gp190 is among the most complex in the hematopoietin receptor family, because it contains two typical cytokine receptor homology domains separated by an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain. Human and murine gp190 proteins share 76% homology, but murine gp190 binds human LIF with a much higher affinity, a property attributed to the Ig-like domain. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the Ig-like domain, we mapped a LIF binding site at its carboxyl terminus, mainly involving residue Phe-328. Mutation of selected residues into their orthologs in the murine receptor (Q251E and N321D) significantly increased the affinity for human LIF. Interestingly, these residues, although localized at both the amino and carboxyl terminus, make a spatially unique LIF binding site in a structural model of the Ig-like module. These results demonstrate definitively the role of the Ig-like domain in LIF binding and the potential to modulate receptor affinity in this family with very limited amino acid changes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Abundant biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that presenilins are catalytic components of gamma-secretase, the protease responsible for generating the Alzheimer amyloid beta-protein. However, the differential localization of presenilins to early secretory compartments and gamma-secretase substrates to late secretory compartments and the plasma membrane (the \"spatial paradox\") argues against this view. We investigated this issue by studying the localization of nicastrin, another putative gamma-secretase component, and its association with presenilin-1 into proteolytically active complexes. Glycosidase digests revealed that nicastrin exists in multiple glycoforms and is terminally sialylated, a modification often associated with the trans-Golgi network. Trafficking of nicastrin to the trans-Golgi network was confirmed by density gradient fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy. In presenilin-deficient cells, however, nicastrin trafficking and maturation were abnormal, as the protein was restricted to early secretory compartments and failed to be sialylated. Mature sialylated nicastrin in trans-Golgi network fractions was complexed quantitatively with N- and C-terminal fragments of presenilin-1, whereas immature nicastrin present in early secretory compartments was not. Additionally, trans-Golgi network fractions contained the gamma-secretase substrate beta-amyloid precursor protein C83 and were enriched in presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase proteolytic activity. The results resolve the apparent spatial paradox by demonstrating that presenilin-nicastrin complexes and presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase activity are co-localized to a late secretory compartment. The findings provide further evidence that presenilin-containing complexes are the gamma-secretase, and indicate that presenilins also regulate gamma-secretase assembly.',\n",

However, little is known about the physiological roles of this ligand-receptor pairing. In the present study we investigated the pharmacology of several apelin analogues at the human recombinant APJ receptor using radioligand binding and functional assays. This has led to the identification of key residues in the apelin peptide required for functional potency and binding affinity through structure-activity studies. In particular, we have identified that replacement of leucine in position 5, or arginine in position 2 and 4 of the C-terminal apelin peptide, apelin-13, resulted in significant changes in pharmacology. We also investigated the detailed localization of pre-proapelin and APJ receptor mRNA in a wide range of human, rat and mouse tissues using quantitative RT-PCR, and carried out a detailed immunohistochemical study of the distribution of the APJ receptor in rat brain and spinal cord. Interestingly, the APJ receptor was not only co-localized in white matter with GFAP in the spinal cord, but was also clearly localized on neurones in the brain, suggesting that this receptor and its peptide may be involved in a wide range of biological process yet to be determined.',\n",

We sought to determine whether in intact cells, the tryptic cleavage/activation of PAR(2) might also be accompanied by hydrolysis at other potential N-terminal cleavage sites, like residues K(34), R(41), K(51), and K(72), as implied by the tryptic cleavage in vitro at these residues of Escherichia coli-expressed human N-terminal PAR(2)R(31)-P(79). To this end, four PAR(2) mutants with altered tryptic cleavage sites were prepared (PAR(2)R(36)A, PAR(2)S(37)P, PAR(2)R(41)A, and PAR(2)R(36)AR(41)A), expressed in Kirsten virus-transformed rat kidney cells and were evaluated together with the wild-type PAR(2)-expressing cells for 1) activation (Ca(2+) signaling) by trypsin and the receptor-activating peptide SLIGRL-NH(2) (SL-NH(2)) and 2) the tryptic release of two antigenic receptor determinants, one N-terminal to the R(36)/S(37) cleavage/activation site detected by SLAW-A antibody and the second (detected by antibody, B5), N-terminal to residues K(51), K(72). None of the mutants resistant to cleavage at R(36) were activated by trypsin, yet all retained reactivity to B5 and all were activated by SL-NH(2). In contrast, trypsin activated both wild-type and PAR(2)R(41)A, leading to a disappearance of SLAW-A but not B5 reactivity. We conclude that, as opposed to the E. coli-expressed PAR(2) N-terminal polypeptide, PAR(2) expressed in intact cells displays selective tryptic cleavage at the R(36)/S(37) activation site, without cleaving downstream. Thus, in intact cells, trypsin activation does not concurrently \"disarm\" rat PAR(2), but leaves the \"tethered ligand\" persistently attached to the body of the receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Members of the transforming growth factor (TGF) beta family play critical roles in regulating placental functions. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategies, we have cloned four transcripts encoding full-length activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7) and three novel ALK7 isoforms from the human placenta. The full-length ALK7 has 493 amino acids and exhibits all characteristics of TGFbeta type I receptors, including an activin receptor-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, a GS domain, and a serine/threonine kinase domain. The three ALK7 isoforms identified include a truncated ALK7 (tALK7) and two soluble proteins designated as soluble ALK7a (sALK7a) and soluble ALK7b (sALK7b). The tALK7 lacks the first 50 amino acids of the full-length ALK7, resulting in a truncated receptor-binding domain. Both sALK7a and sALK7b lack transmembrane and GS domains. The ALK7 gene, located on chromosome 2q24.1, is composed of at least nine exons and eight introns. The isoforms of ALK7 are generated by alternative splicing. Transcripts encoding the sALK7 isoforms differ from the full-length transcript by lacking exon III or both exons III and IV in sALK7a and sALK7b, respectively. The transcript for tALK7 uses an alternative exon located within the first intron of the full-length transcript. These results indicate that four distinct proteins are encoded by the human ALK7 gene. Both reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that ALK7 and its isoforms are expressed in human placentae of different stages of pregnancy and that their expression is developmentally regulated. In addition, mRNA expression of Nodal, a ligand for ALK7, was also detected in placentae of different gestational age. The role of Nodal and ALK7 in human placenta is currently under investigation.',\n",

In this study we investigated whether these RFamide peptides, which have common structural features in their C-terminal RFamide motif and share several physiologically important functions, could exert their effects through the same set of receptors. The affinity and functional activity of several related RFamide peptides were determined at the human neuropeptide FF receptor subtype 2 (hNPFF2) and the human prolactin-releasing peptide (hPrRP) receptors. The full-length human prolactin releasing peptide 31 (hPrRP31) had significantly higher efficacy compared with NPFF and its stable analog, (1DMe)Y8Fa, at the hNPFF2 receptor. In contrast, NPFF and (1DMe)Y8Fa were not efficacious at the hPrRP receptor. Our study indicated a generally relatively low level of discrimination for RFamide peptides at the NPFF receptor, whereas the hPrRP receptor clearly preferred PrRP or very closely related peptides. The seemingly promiscuous binding of the RFamide peptides to the NPFF receptor was further confirmed by receptor autoradiography. PrRP may thus signal through the NPFF receptors in vivo.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The structural relationship between the motilin and the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), and between their respective ligands, motilin and ghrelin, prompted us to investigate whether ghrelin and the GHS-R agonist growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6), could interact with the motilin receptor. The interaction was evaluated in the rabbit gastric antrum with binding studies on membrane preparations and with contraction studies on muscle strips in the presence of selective antagonists under conditions of electrical field stimulation (EFS) or not. Binding studies indicated that the affinity (pK(d)) for the motilin receptor was in the order of ghrelin (4.23 +/- 0.07) < GHRP-6 (5.54 +/- 0.08) < motilin (9.13 +/- 0.03). The interaction of ghrelin with the motilin receptor requires the octanoyl group. Motilin induced smooth muscle contractile responses but ghrelin and GHRP-6 were ineffective. EFS elicited on- and off-responses that were increased by motilin already at 10(-9) M, but not by 10(-5) M ghrelin. In contrast, GHRP-6 also enhanced the on- and off-responses. The motilin antagonist Phe-cyclo[Lys-Tyr(3-tBu)-betaAla-] trifluoroacetate (GM-109) blocked the effect of GHRP-6 on the off-responses but not on the on-responses. Under nonadrenergic noncholinergic conditions, the effects of motilin and GHRP-6 on the on-responses were abolished; those on the off-responses were preserved. All responses were blocked by neurokinin (NK)(1) and NK(2) antagonists. In conclusion, ghrelin is unable to induce contractions via the motilin receptor. However, GHRP-6 enhances neural contractile responses, partially via interaction with the motilin receptor on noncholinergic nerves with tachykinins as mediator, and partially via another receptor that may be a GHS-R subtype on cholinergic nerves that corelease tachykinins.',\n",

Responses mediated by activation of both receptor subtypes with either orexin-A or -B were primarily dependent on extracellular Ca(2+), suggesting similar activation of Ca(2+) influx as we have previously shown for orexin-A and OX(1) receptors. Amino acid-wise truncation of orexin-A reduced its ability to activate OX(1) and OX(2) receptors, but the response mediated by the OX(2) receptor was more resistant to truncation than the response mediated by the OX(1) receptor. We also performed a sequential replacement of amino acids 14 to 26 with alanine in the truncated orexin-A variant orexin-A(14-33). Replacement of the same amino acids produced a fall in the potency for each receptor subtype, but the reduction was less prominent for the OX(2) receptor. The most marked reduction was produced by the replacement of Leu20, Asp25, and His26 with alanine. Interestingly, extracellular Ca(2+) dependence of responses to some of the mutated peptides was different from those of orexin-A and -B. The mutagenesis also suggests that although the determinants required from orexin-A for binding to and activation of the receptor are highly conserved between the orexin receptor subtypes, the OX(2) receptor requires fewer determinants. This might in part explain why orexin-B has the affinity and potency equal to orexin-A for this subtype, although it has 10- to 100-fold lower affinity and potency for the OX(1) receptor.',\n",

A shorter variant of this receptor lacking exon 1 was shown to have subnanomolar affinity for neuropeptide FF (NPFF), a pain modulatory peptide, and therefore was named NPFF(2) receptor. Here, we characterize the full-length cloned NPGPR and identify a novel short form lacking exon 2 with a differential pattern of mRNA abundance in several tissues and organs. The NPGPR is most similar to the recently cloned neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor which lacks exon 1, but also shows high homology to the orexin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor families, two neuropeptides involved in food intake regulation. Therefore, we used binding studies to examine the interaction of NPFF, orexin and NPY with the NPGPR. [125I] NPFF was displaced by NPFF with an IC(50) of 14.7 +/- 8.8 nM, whereas [125I] Orexin B was displaced by Orexin B with an IC(50) of 415 +/- 195 nM. We conclude that orexins interact with the NPGPR and that the affinity of NPFF for NPGPR is approximately 100-fold lower than for the NPFF2 receptor. We postulate that NPGPR is a splice variant of the family of NPFF receptors and displays a binding profile different from the other members of the NPFF receptor family due to the presence of exon 1. In order to evaluate whether NPGPR levels are affected by the feeding status, we examined the mRNA level using real-time PCR in two feeding models, i.e. before and after diet-induced body weight increase as well as after chronic food restriction in rats. However, hypothalamic NPGPR mRNA was unchanged in both models. Therefore, our evidence does not support the hypothesis that NPGPR is involved in feeding regulation.',\n",

Various collagen types bind to and activate the DDRs, but the molecular details of collagen recognition have not been well defined. In this study, recombinant extracellular domains of DDR1 and DDR2 were produced to explore DDR-collagen binding in detail. In solid phase assays, both DDRs bound collagen I with high affinity. DDR1 recognized collagen I only as a dimeric and not as a monomeric construct, indicating a requirement for receptor dimerization in the DDR1-collagen interaction. The DDRs contain a discoidin homology domain in their extracellular domains, and the isolated discoidin domain of DDR2 bound collagen I with high affinity. Furthermore, the discoidin domain of DDR2, but not of DDR1, was sufficient for transmembrane receptor signaling. To map the collagen binding site within the discoidin domain of DDR2, mutant constructs were created, in which potential surface-exposed loops in DDR2 were exchanged for the corresponding loops of functionally unrelated discoidin domains. Three spatially adjacent surface loops within the DDR2 discoidin domain were found to be critically involved in collagen binding of the isolated DDR2 extracellular domain. In addition, the same loops were required for collagen-dependent receptor activation. It is concluded that the loop region opposite to the polypeptide chain termini of the DDR2 discoidin domain constitutes the collagen recognition site.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Netrin-1 and its receptors play an essential role patterning the nervous system by guiding neurons and axons to their targets. To explore whether netrin-1 organizes nonneural tissues, we examined its role in mammary gland morphogenesis. Netrin-1 is expressed in prelumenal cells, and its receptor neogenin is expressed in a complementary pattern in adjacent cap cells of terminal end buds (TEBs). We discovered that loss of either gene results in disorganized TEBs characterized by exaggerated subcapsular spaces, breaks in basal lamina, dissociated cap cells, and an increased influx of cap cells into the prelumenal compartment. Cell aggregation assays demonstrate that neogenin mediates netrin-1-dependent cell clustering. Thus, netrin-1 appears to act locally through neogenin to stabilize the multipotent progenitor (cap) cell layer during mammary gland development. Our results suggest that netrin-1 and its receptor neogenin provide an adhesive, rather than a guidance, function during nonneural organogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a neurotrophic cytokine that exerts a neuroprotective effect in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Clinical application of human CNTF, however, was prevented by high toxicity at higher dosages. Human CNTF elicits cellular responses by induction of a receptor complex consisting of the CNTF alpha-receptor (CNTFR), which is not involved in signal transduction, and the beta-receptors gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Previous studies with rat CNTF demonstrated that rat CNTF is unable to interact with the human interleukin-6 alpha-receptor, whereas at high concentrations, it can directly induce a signaling heterodimer of human gp130 and human LIFR in the absence of the CNTF receptor. Here, we demonstrate that human CNTF cannot directly induce a heterodimer of human gp130 and LIFR. However, human CNTF can use both the membrane-bound and the soluble human IL-6R as a substitute for its cognate alpha-receptor and thus widen the target spectrum of human CNTF. Engineering a CNTFR-specific human CNTF variant may therefore be a prerequisite to improving the safety profile of CNTF.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have previously shown that the CC-chemokine 1-309 (CCL1) protects mouse thymic lymphomas against corticoid-induced apoptosis. Here, we analyzed the signal transduction pathways involved in this activity on BW5147 lymphoma. Inhibition of the CCL1 activity by pertussis toxin suggested the involvement of a G protein-coupled chemokine receptor. The role of CCR8 was supported by the observation that vMIP-I, another CCR8-ligand identified from the genome of a T cell transforming herpes virus, shared CCL1 anti-apoptotic activity. In addition to CCR8, BW5147 cells also expressed the CXCR4 receptor but its ligand, SDF-1 (CXCL12) showed only a modest anti-apoptotic activity. Other chemokines acting on CCR2, CCR4 and CCR5 failed to protect against apoptosis and to induce BW5147 chemotaxis, suggesting that these receptors were not functionally expressed. By contrast, both CCL1 and vMIP-I up-regulated ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation in BW5147 cells. Further analysis demonstrated that CCL1 activates the MAPK pathway in CCR8-transfected CHO cells. The implication of this pathway was confirmed by the fact that PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK kinases, as well as a dominant negative isoform of the M-RAS protein specifically blocked the anti-apoptotic activity of CCL1.',\n",

Seven women with pre-eclampsia symptoms were matched with 10 normal pregnant controls for gestational age, maternal age, and parity. Total RNA was isolated from each sample. Complementary DNA samples produced by reverse transcription were used in the real time PCR to quantify the expression of inhibin alpha subunit, inhibin/activin beta(A), beta(B), beta(C) subunits, follistatin, ACTRIA, ACTRIB, ACTRIIA, ACTRIIB, beta-glycan and GAPDH genes. The ratio between the target and GAPDH expression was calculated to provide relative gene expression. Inhibin alpha:GAPDH and inhibin/activin beta(A): GAPDH ratios were significantly higher in placental tissue from women with pre-eclampsia (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01 respectively) compared with matched control placental gene expression. Placental samples from both groups expressed beta(B), beta(C), follistatin, activin receptors and beta-glycan genes. However, there was no significant difference in the relative expression of these genes between the groups. Increases in the placental expression of inhibin alpha and inhibin/activin beta(A) subunit genes could contribute to the rise in circulating levels of inhibin A and activin A in pre-eclampsia. The mechanism(s) involved in increased gene expression in pre-eclampsia is as yet unclear.',\n",

In this study we demonstrate the ability of TIMP3 to inhibit vascular endothelial factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis and identify the potential mechanism by which this occurs: TIMP3 blocks the binding of VEGF to VEGF receptor-2 and inhibits downstream signaling and angiogenesis.

Compound 1 competitively inhibits binding of [3H]oxytocin and the peptide antagonist 125I-ornithine vasotocin analog to human and rat oxytocin receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA or Chinese hamster ovary cells with nanomolar potency. Selectivity against vasopressin receptor subtypes is >6-fold for V1a and >350-fold for V2 and V1b. Compound 1 inhibits oxytocin-evoked intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (IC50 = 8 nM). Compound 1 has no intrinsic agonist activity at the oxytocin receptor. Oxytocininduced contraction of isolated rat uterine strips is blocked by compound 1 (pA2 = 7.82). In anesthetized nonpregnant rats, single administration of compound 1 by i.v. or oral routes causes dose-dependent inhibition of contractions elicited by repeated injections of oxytocin with ED50 = 3.5 mg/kg i.v. and 89 mg/kg p.o., respectively.

       "  'Abstract': \"The neuropeptide Y (NPY) family peptides NPY, peptide YY (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) bind to four G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5. A key step in the desensitization and internalization of GPCRs is the association of the receptor with beta-arrestins. In the present study, these receptors were analyzed with respect to their ability to interact with GFP2-tagged beta-arrestin 2 using the new bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 2 method. Agonists induced a concentration-dependent association of beta-arrestin 2 with all four receptors. Whereas the Y1 receptor exhibited the highest maximum response and rapid association (t(1/2) = 3.4 min), the maximal signals for the association of Y2 and Y4 receptors were less than half of that of Y1, and the association rates were much slower. Interestingly, when evaluated at the Y4 receptor, the Y4 agonist 1229U91 [(Ile,Glu,Pro,Dpr,Tyr,Arg, Leu,Arg,Try-NH2)-2-cyclic(2,4'),(2',4)-diamide] was unable to provoke the same maximal response as human PP, suggesting that 1229U91 is a partial agonist. When stimulated by PYY, the Y5 receptor responded with a t(1/2) of 4.6 min and a maximal response approximately 60% of what was observed with Y1. Because beta-arrestins are key components in GPCR internalization, it is interesting to note that the receptor that is known to internalize rapidly (Y1) exhibits the most rapid association with beta-arrestin 2, whereas the receptor that is known to internalize slowly, or not at all (Y2) associates slowly with beta-arrestin 2.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Reelin, Disabled-1 (Dab1), apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), and very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) participate in a signaling pathway required for layer formation during mammalian brain development. Binding of Reelin to ApoER2 and VLDLR induces a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1, an adaptor protein that associates with the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors. However, Reelin has also been proposed to signal through integrin and protocadherin. Here we compare the roles of ApoER2 and VLDLR in Reelin signaling. We used layer-specific markers to identify the final positions of early- and late-born neurons in the cortices of mice lacking ApoER2, VLDLR, or both ApoER2 and VLDLR. Subtle alterations were observed in mice lacking VLDLR, whereas more severe abnormalities were detected in the absence of ApoER2, and major disruptions were obvious in mice lacking both receptors. Purified Reelin associated more readily with ApoER2 than with VLDLR and no synergy was observed in the presence of both receptors. Consistent with the binding data, the level of Reelin-induced Dab1 phosphorylation was more severely reduced in neurons lacking ApoER2 than in neurons lacking VLDLR. However, similarly low levels of Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation were observed in ApoER2(-/-) and VLDLR(-/-) mice in vivo. Finally, there was a complete absence of Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 in cortical neurons from mice lacking both ApoER2 and VLDLR. These findings demonstrate that ApoER2 and VLDLR are essential for Reelin signaling and that no other receptor molecules can compensate for their role in mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) plays an essential role in human host defense against intracellular bacteria. Type-1 cytokines, particularly gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and IL-23, the major cytokines that regulate IFN-gamma production, are essential in CMI. This is illustrated by patients with unusual severe infections caused by poorly pathogenic mycobacteria and Salmonella species, in whom genetic deficiencies have been identified in several key genes in the type-1 cytokine pathway, including IL12RB1, the gene encoding the beta1 chain of the IL-12 and IL-23 receptors. Several mutations in IL12RB1 with deleterious effects on human IL-12R function have been identified, including nonsense and missense mutations. In addition, a number of coding IL12RB1 polymorphisms have been reported. In order to gain more insight into the effect that IL12RB1 mutations and genetic variations can have on IL-12Rbeta1 function, three approaches have been followed. First, we determined the degree of conservation at the variant amino acid positions in IL-12Rbeta1 between different species, using known deleterious mutations, known variations in IL-12Rbeta1, as well as novel coding variations that we have identified at position S74R and R156H. Second, we analyzed the potential impact of these amino acid variations on the three-dimensional structure of the IL-12Rbeta1 protein. Third, we analyzed the putative functions of different IL-12Rbeta1 domains, partly based on their homology with gp130, and analyzed the possible effects of the above amino acid variations on the function of these domains. Based on these analyses, we propose an integrated model of IL-12Rbeta1 structure and function. This significantly enhances our molecular understanding of the human IL-12 and IL-23 systems.',\n",

However, their functions during the early phases of the immune response are poorly documented. In the present study, we show that PGD(2 )inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, the CD40- and LPS-induced secretion of the Th1-driving factor IL-12 by murine splenic dendritic cells (DC), the most potent antigen-presenting cells. The inhibition of IL-12 production is mediated only in part by the cell surface G alpha s protein-coupled D prostanoid receptor (termed DP1) but not by the G alpha i protein-coupled DP receptor, DP2. We show that recruitment of DP1 in DC results in the activation of a cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway that is partially responsible for the inhibition of IL-12 production. We also suggest that the DP1-independent effects exerted by PGD(2) on IL-12 production may be due to the action of ist PGJ(2), but not PGF(2)alpha, metabolites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that PGD(2) affects NF-kappa B activation through (the) DP1-independent pathway(s). Together these data suggest that PGD(2), by interacting with DP1 and by binding to other target cellular proteins, may regulate immune responses by affecting IL-12 production in DC.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The cytoplasmic domains of integrins play a key role in a variety of integrin-mediated events including adhesion, migration, and signaling. The molecular mechanisms that enhance integrin function are still incompletely understood. Because protein kinases are known to be involved in the signaling and the activation of integrins, the role of phosphorylation has been studied by several groups. The beta(2) leukocyte integrin subunit has previously been shown to become phosphorylated in leukocytes on cytoplasmic serine and functionally important threonine residues. We have now mapped the phosphorylated threonine residues in activated T cells. After phorbol ester stimulation, all three threonine residues (758-760) of the threonine triplet became phosphorylated but only two at a time. CD3 stimulation leads to a strong threonine phosphorylation of the beta(2) integrin, but differed from phorbol ester activation in that phosphorylation occurred only on threonine 758. The other leukocyte-specific integrin, beta(7), has also been shown to need the cytoplasmic domain and leukocyte-specific signal transduction elements for integrin activation. Cell activation with phorbol ester, and interestingly, through the TCR-CD3 complex, caused beta(7) integrin binding to VCAM-1. Additionally, cell activation led to increased phosphorylation of the beta(7) subunit, and phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that threonine residues became phosphorylated after cell activation. Sequence analysis by manual radiosequencing by Edman degradation established that threonine phosphorylation occurred in the same threonine triplet as in beta(2) phosphorylation.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Tumstatin and endostatin are two inhibitors of angiogenesis derived from precursor human collagen molecules known as alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen and alpha1 chain of type XVIII collagen, respectively. Although both these inhibitors are noncollagenous (NC1) domain fragments of collagens, they only share a 14% amino acid homology. In the present study we evaluated the functional receptors, mechanism of action, and intracellular signaling induced by these two collagen-derived inhibitors. Human tumstatin prevents angiogenesis via inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis with no effect on migration, whereas human endostatin prevents endothelial cell migration with no effect on proliferation. We demonstrate that human tumstatin binds to alpha v beta 3 integrin in a vitronectin/fibronectin/RGD cyclic peptide independent manner, whereas human endostatin competes with fibronectin/RGD cyclic peptide to bind alpha 5 beta 1 integrin. The activity of human tumstatin is mediated by alpha v beta 3 integrin, whereas the activity of human endostatin is mediated by alpha 5 beta 1 integrin. Additionally, although human tumstatin binding to alpha v beta 3 integrin leads to the inhibition of Cap-dependent translation (protein synthesis) mediated by focal adhesion kinase/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway, human endostatin binding to alpha 5 beta 1 integrin leads to the inhibition of focal adhesion kinase/c-Raf/MEK1/2/p38/ERK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, with no effect on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 and Cap-dependent translation. Collectively, such distinct properties of human tumstatin and human endostatin provide the first insight into their diverse antiangiogenic actions and argue for combining them for targeting tumor angiogenesis.',\n",

Unlike activins, however, signaling by nodal, Vg1, and growth and differentiation factor 1 requires a coreceptor from the epidermal growth factor-Cripto-FRL1-Cryptic protein family such as Cripto. Cripto has important roles during development and oncogenesis and binds nodal or related ligands and ALK4 to facilitate assembly of type I and type II receptor signaling complexes. Because Cripto mediates signaling via activin receptors and binds directly to ALK4, we tested whether transfection with Cripto would affect the ability of activin to signal and/or interact with its receptors. Here we show that Cripto can form a complex with activin and ActRII/IIB. We were unable to detect activin binding to Cripto in the absence of ActRII/IIB, indicating that unlike nodal, activin requires type II receptors to bind Cripto. If cotransfected with ActRII/IIB and ALK4, Cripto inhibited crosslinking of activin to ALK4 and the association of ALK4 with ActRII/IIB. In addition, Cripto blocked activin signaling when transfected into either HepG2 cells or 293T cells. We have also shown that under conditions in which Cripto facilitates nodal signaling, it antagonizes activin. Inhibition of activin signaling provides an additional example of a Cripto effect on the regulation of signaling by transforming growth factor-beta superfamily members. Because activin is a potent inhibitor of cell growth in multiple cell types, these results provide a mechanism that may partially explain the oncogenic action of Cripto.',\n",

To investigate the structural determinants of ligand binding specificity, we examined the extracellular domain of human (h) RAMP1 using various deletion mutants. Co-expression of the hRAMP1 mutants with hCRLR in HEK-293 cells revealed that deletion of residues 91-94, 96-100, or 101-103 blocked [125I]CGRP binding and completely abolished intracellular cAMP accumulation normally elicited by CGRP or AM. On the other hand, the deletion of residues 78-80 or 88-90 significantly attenuated only AM-evoked responses. In all of these cases, the receptor heterodimers were fully expressed at the cell surface. Substituting alanine for residues 91-103 one at a time had little effect on CGRP-induced responses, indicating that although this segment is essential for high affinity agonist binding to the receptors, none of the residues directly interacts with either CGRP or AM. This finding suggests that RAMPs probably determine ligand specificity by contributing to the structure of the ligand-binding pocket or by allosteric modulation of the conformation of the receptor. Interestingly, the L94A mutant up-regulated surface expression of the receptor heterodimer to a greater degree than wild-type hRAMP1, thereby increasing CGRP binding and signaling. L94A also significantly increased cell surface expression of the hRAMP1 deletion mutant D101-103 when co-transfected with hCRLR, and expression of a L94A/D101-103 double mutant markedly attenuated the activity of endogenous RAMP1 in HEK-293T cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors CCK1R and CCK2R exert important central and peripheral functions by binding the neuropeptide cholecystokinin. Because these receptors are potential therapeutic targets, great interest has been devoted to the identification of efficient ligands that selectively activate or inhibit these receptors. A complete mapping of the CCK binding site in these receptors would help to design new CCK ligands and to optimize their properties. In this view, a molecular model of the CCK2R occupied by CCK was built to identify CCK2R residues that interact with CCK functional groups. No such study has yet been reported for the CCK2R. Docking of CCK in the receptor was performed by taking into account our previous mutagenesis data and by using, as constraint, the direct interaction that we demonstrated between His207 in the CCK2R and Asp8 of CCK (Mol Pharmacol 54:364-371, 1998; J Biol Chem 274:23191-23197, 1999). Two residues that had not been revealed in our previous mutagenesis studies, Tyr189 (Y4.60) and Asn358 (N6.55), were identified in interaction via hydrogen bonds with the C-terminal amide of CCK, a crucial functional group of the peptide. Mutagenesis of Tyr189 (Y4.60) and Asn358 (N6.55) as well as structure-affinity studies with modified CCK analogs validated these interactions and the involvement of both residues in the CCK binding site. These results indicate that the present molecular model is an important tool to identify direct contact points between CCK and the CCK2R and to rapidly progress in mapping of the CCK2R binding site. Moreover, comparison of the present CCK2R.CCK molecular model with that of CCK1R.CCK, which we have previously published and validated, clearly argues that the positioning of CCK in these receptors is different.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Skeletal homeostasis is determined by systemic hormones and local factors. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are unique because they induce the differentiation of mesenchymal cells toward cells of the osteoblastic lineage and also enhance the differentiated function of the osteoblast. However, the activity of BMPs needs to be tempered by intracellular and extracellular antagonists. BMPs bind to specific receptors and signal by phosphorylating the cytoplasmic proteins mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad) 1 and 5, which form heterodimers with Smad 4, and after nuclear translocation regulate transcription. BMP antagonists can be categorized as pseudoreceptors that compete with signaling receptors, inhibitory Smads that block signaling, intracellular binding proteins that bind Smad 1 and 5, and factors that induce ubiquitination and proteolysis of signaling Smads. In addition, a large number of extracellular proteins that bind BMPs and prevent their binding to signaling receptors have emerged. They are the components of the Spemann organizer, noggin, chordin, and follistatin, members of the Dan/Cerberus family, and twisted gastrulation. The antagonists tend to be specific for BMPs and are regulated by BMPs, indicating the existence and need of local feedback mechanisms to temper BMP cellular activities.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Orexins (hypocretins) are recently discovered excitatory transmitters implicated in arousal and sleep. Yet, their ionic and signal transduction mechanisms have not been fully clarified. Here we show that orexins suppress G-protein-coupled inward rectifier (GIRK) channel activity, and this suppression is likely to lead to neuronal excitation. Cultured neurons from the locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus tuberomammillaris (TM) were used, as well as HEK293A cells transfected with GIRK1 and 2, either human orexin receptor type 1 (OX1R) or type 2 (OX2R), mu opioid receptor and GFP cDNAs. In GTPgammaS-loaded cells, orexin A (OXA, 3 microM) inhibited GIRK currents that had previously been activated by somatostatin (in LC cells), nociceptin (TM cells), or the mu opioid agonist DAMGO (HEK cells). In guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-loaded HEK cells, in which GIRK currents were not preactivated, OXA induced a biphasic response through both types of orexin receptors: an initial current increase and a subsequent decrease to below resting levels. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships revealed that both the OXA-induced and suppressed currents are inwardly rectifying with reversal potentials around EK. The OXA-induced initial current was partially pertussis toxin (PTX) sensitive and partially PTX insensitive, whereas the OXA-suppressed current was PTX insensitive. These data suggest that orexin receptors couple with more than one type of G-protein, including PTX-sensitive (such as Gi/o) and PTX-insensitive (such as Gq/11) G-proteins. The modulation of GIRK channels by orexins may be one of the cellular mechanisms for the regulation of brain nuclei (e.g., LC and TM) that are crucial for arousal, sleep, and appetite.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'IL-13 receptors and signaling pathways: an evolving web.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'IL-13 is an immunoregulatory cytokine secreted predominantly by activated T(H)2 cells. Over the past several years, it has become evident that IL-13 is a key mediator in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. IL-13 shares many functional properties with IL-4, stemming from the fact that they share a common receptor subunit, the alpha subunit of the IL-4 receptor (IL-4Ralpha). Characterization of IL-13-deficient mice, IL-4-deficient mice, and IL-4 receptor alpha-deficient (IL-4Ralpha(-/-)) mice have demonstrated nonredundant roles for IL-13. IL-13 mediates its effects by interacting with a complex receptor system comprised of IL-4Ralpha and two IL-13 binding proteins, IL-13Ralpha1 and IL-13Ralpha2. IL-13 receptors are expressed on human B cells, basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, respiratory epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. However, functional IL-13 receptors have not been demonstrated on human or mouse T cells. Thus unlike IL-4, IL-13 does not appear to be important in the initial differentiation of CD4 T cells into T(H)2-type cells but rather appears to be important in the effector phase of allergic inflammation. This is further supported by many in vivo observations, including that administration of IL-13 resulted in allergic inflammation, tissue-specific overexpression of IL-13 in the lungs of transgenic mice resulted in airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion, IL-13 blockade abolished allergic inflammation independently of IL-4, and IL-13 appears to be more important than IL-4 in mucus hypersecretion. Given the importance of IL-13 as an effector molecule, regulation at the level of its receptors might be an important mechanism of modulating IL-13 responses and thus propagation of the allergic response. Accordingly, IL-13 is an attractive, novel therapeutic target for pharmacologic intervention in allergic disorders. This review will summarize the current understanding of the IL-13 receptors and signaling pathways, emphasizing recent observations.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), and oncostatin M (OSM) are four helix bundle cytokines acting through a common heterodimeric receptor composed of gp130 and LIF receptor (LIFR). Binding to LIFR occurs through a binding site characterized by an FXXK motif located at the N terminus of helix D (site III). The immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of LIFR was modeled, and the physico-chemical properties of its Connolly surface were analyzed. This analysis revealed an area displaying properties complementary to those of the LIF site III. Two residues of the Ig-like domain of LIFR, Asp214 and Phe284, formed a mirror image of the FXXK motif. Engineered LIFR mutants in which either or both of these two residues were mutated to alanine were transfected in Ba/F3 cells already containing gp130. The F284A mutation impaired the biological response induced by LIF and CT-1, whereas the response to OSM remained unchanged. The Asp214 mutation did not alter the functional responses. The D214A/F284A double mutation, however, totally impaired cellular proliferation to LIF and CT-1 and partially impaired OSM-induced proliferation with a 20-fold increase in EC50. These results were corroborated by the analysis of STAT3 phosphorylation and Scatchard analysis of cytokine binding to Ba/F3 cells. Molecular modeling of the complex of LIF with the Ig-like domain of LIFR provides a clue for the superadditivity of the D214A/F284A double mutation. Our results indicate that LIF, CT-1, and OSM share an overlapping binding site located in the Ig-like domain of LIFR. The different behaviors of LIF and CT-1, on one side, and of OSM, on the other side, can be related to the different affinity of their site III for LIFR.',\n",

J Am Soc Nephrol 10: 472-480, 1999). Its signaling pathway does not include cGMP, cAMP, or Ca2+ but leads to inhibition of K+ channels. In patch-clamp experiments, effects of tyrosine kinase receptor blockers on C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP)-mediated depolarizations of membrane voltages (Vm) of IHKE-1 cells were tested. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor blocker genistein (10 microM) abolished the effect of CNP (0.2 +/- 0.4 mV, n = 7), and comparable results were obtained with 10 microM daidzein (n = 8). Aminogenistein (10 microM, n = 5) and tyrphostin AG1295 (10 microM, n = 5) had no significant effects. EGF (1 nM) hyperpolarized cells by -5.3 +/- 0.8 mV (n = 5). This effect was completely blocked by genistein or daidzein. The Cl- channel blocker NPPB (10 microM, n = 5) inhibited the EGF-mediated hyperpolarization. mRNA expression of NPR-B and NPR-Bi shows reversed patterns along the human nephron. NPR-B is highly expressed in glomeruli and proximal tubules, whereas NPR-Bi shows strong signals in the distal nephron. Expression of NPR-Bi in the cortical collecting duct was also confirmed with immunohistochemistry. In other human tissues, NPR-Bi shows strongest expression in pancreas and lung, whereas in the heart and liver NPR-B is the dominating receptor. In conclusion, CNP inhibits an apical K+ channel in IHKE-1 cells independently of cGMP and so far this effect can only be blocked by genistein and daidzein. Tyrosine phosphorylation might be the missing link in the signaling pathway of CNP/NPR-Bi.',\n",

SDF-1/CXCL12 had survival-enhancing/antiapoptosis effects on human bone marrow (BM) and cord blood (CB) and mouse BM colony-forming units (CFU)-granulocyte macrophage, burst-forming units-erythroid, and CFU-granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte with similar dose responses. The survival effects were direct-acting, as assessed on colony formation by single isolated human BM and CB CD34(+++) cells. Effects were mediated through CXCR4 and G(alpha)i proteins.

       "  'Abstract': 'Orphan G-protein-coupled receptors are a large class of receptors whose cognate ligands are unknown. SP9155 (also referred to as AQ27 and GPR103) is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor originally cloned from a human brain cDNA library. SP9155 was found to be predominantly expressed in brain, heart, kidney, retina, and testis. Phylogenetic analysis shows that SP9155 shares high homology with Orexin, NPFF, and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors, but identification of the endogenous ligand for SP9155 has not been reported. In this study, we have used a novel method to predict peptides from genome data bases. From these predicted peptides, a novel RF-amide peptide, P52 was shown to selectively activate SP9155-transfected cells. We subsequently cloned the precursor gene of the P52 ligand and characterized the activity of other possible peptides encoded by the precursor. This revealed an extended peptide, P518, which exhibited high affinity for SP9155 (EC50 = 7 nm). mRNA expression analysis revealed that the peptide P518 precursor gene is predominantly expressed in various brain regions, coronary arteries, thyroid and parathyroid glands, large intestine, colon, bladder, testes, and prostate. These results indicate the existence of a novel RF-amide neuroendocrine peptide system, and suggest that SP9155 is likely the relevant G-protein-coupled receptor for this peptide.',\n",

Strangely, CCL27 can also be produced as a non-secreted form, as a result of alternative splicing. This protein, termed PESKY, is targeted to the nucleus where it is able to modulate transcription and alter cell morphology. Specifically, PESKY induces a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, manifest by the disruption of stress fibres. This consequently enhances cell motility. Surprisingly, secreted CCL27 can also reach the nucleus after CCR10-mediated internalisation, where it may also be capable of directly modulating transcription to alter cell behaviour.

       "  'Abstract': 'GPR7 and GPR8 are orphan G protein-coupled receptors that are highly similar to each other. These receptors are expressed predominantly in brain, suggesting roles in central nervous system function. We have purified an endogenous peptide ligand for GPR7 from bovine hypothalamus extracts. This peptide, termed neuropeptide B (NPB), has a C-6-brominated tryptophan residue at the N terminus. It binds and activates human GPR7 or GPR8 with median effective concentrations (EC(50)) of 0.23 nM and 15.8 nM, respectively. In situ hybridization shows distinct localizations of the prepro-NPB mRNA in mouse brain, i.e., in paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, hippocampus, and several nuclei in midbrain and brainstem. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of NPB in mice induces hyperphagia during the first 2 h, followed by hypophagia. Intracerebroventricular injection of NPB produces analgesia to s.c. formalin injection in rats. Through EST database searches, we identified a putative paralogous peptide. This peptide, termed neuropeptide W (NPW), also has an N-terminal tryptophan residue. Synthetic human NPW binds and activates human GPR7 or GPR8 with EC(50) values of 0.56 nM and 0.51 nM, respectively. The expression of NPW mRNA in mouse brain is confined to specific nuclei in midbrain and brainstem. These findings suggest diverse physiological functions of NPB and NPW in the central nervous system, acting as endogenous ligands on GPR7 andor GPR8.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid mediator with diverse physiological and pathological actions on many types of cells. LPA has been widely considered to elicit its biological functions through three types of G protein-coupled receptors, Edg-2 (endothelial cell differentiation gene-2)/LPA1/vzg-1 (ventricular zone gene-1), Edg-4/LPA2, and Edg-7/LPA3. We identified an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, p2y9/GPR23, as the fourth LPA receptor (LPA4). Membrane fractions of RH7777 cells transiently expressing p2y9/GPR23 displayed a specific binding for 1-oleoyl-LPA with a Kd value of around 45 nm. Competition binding and reporter gene assays showed that p2y9/GPR23 preferred structural analogs of LPA with a rank order of 1-oleoyl- > 1-stearoyl- > 1-palmitoyl- > 1-myristoyl- > 1-alkyl- > 1-alkenyl-LPA. In Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing p2y9/GPR23, 1-oleoyl-LPA induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that mRNA of p2y9/GPR23 was significantly abundant in ovary compared with other tissues. Interestingly, p2y9/GPR23 shares only 20-24% amino acid identities with Edg-2/LPA1, Edg-4/LPA2, and Edg-7/LPA3, and phylogenetic analysis also shows that p2y9/GPR23 is far distant from the Edg family. These facts suggest that p2y9/GPR23 has evolved from different ancestor sequences from the Edg family.',\n",

Thermolytic digestion demonstrated three disulfide bond pairings of the EGF-like domain in HB-EGF is consistent with that of human-EGF and human-TGF-alpha. HB-EGF(44-86) showed high binding affinity to EGF-receptor, like human-EGF. The truncation of the C-terminal Leu86 residue from HB-EGF(44-86), HB-EGF(45-86) or HB-EGF(46-86) caused a drastic reduction in the binding affinity to the EGF receptor. These results suggest that the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF plays an important role in the binding to the EGF receptor, and its C-terminal Leu86 residue is necessary for binding with the EGF-receptor. In addition, the deletion of the two N-terminal residues (Asp44-Pro45) from HB-EGF(44-86) caused a 10-fold decrease in relative binding affinity to the EGF receptor.

To investigate the role of exon 10 in LH/hCG action in vitro we created stable COS-7 cells expressing the LHR with (wt) or without (-ex10) exon 10. Binding experiments showed that the affinities of LH and hCG to the LHR wt and -ex10 were similar. Stimulation of wt with hCG or LH resulted in increased cAMP. cAMP production was significantly impaired in -ex10 stimulated with LH. This response was not altered by pertussis toxin, excluding that G(i) becomes activated in LHR -ex10. In desensitization experiments, intracellular cAMP of LHR wt and -ex10 declined to approximately 30%. No difference in intracellular cAMP was detected between LHR wt or -ex10 after recovery and restimulation with hCG or LH. These experiments show that impaired cAMP production of LHR -ex10 stimulated with LH is not due to anomalous receptor coupling or desensitization. We conclude that although exon 10 of the LHR plays no role in ligand binding, it is important for receptor activation by LH by a mechanism probably involving extracellular conformational changes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Mature TGF-beta isoforms, which are covalent dimers, signal by binding to three types of cell surface receptors, the type I, II and III TGF-beta receptors. A complex composed of the TGF-beta ligand and the type I and II receptors is required for signaling. The type II receptor is responsible for recruiting TGF-beta into the heteromeric ligand/type I receptor/type II receptor complex. The purpose of this study was to test for the extent that avidity contributes to receptor affinity. Using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor (the BIACORE), we captured the extracellular domain of the type II receptor (TbetaRIIED) at the biosensor surface in an oriented and stable manner by using a de novo designed coiled-coil (E/K coil) heterodimerizing system. We characterized the kinetics of binding of three TGF-beta isoforms to this immobilized TbetaRIIED. The results demonstrate that the stoichiometry of TGF-beta binding to TbetaRIIED was one dimeric ligand to two receptors. All three TGF-beta isoforms had rapid and similar association rates, but different dissociation rates, which resulted in the equilibrium dissociation constants being approximately 5pM for the TGF-beta1 and -beta3 isoforms, and 5nM for the TGF-beta2 isoform. Since these apparent affinities are at least four orders of magnitude higher than those determined when TGF-beta was immobilized, and are close to those determined for TbetaRII at the cell surface, we suggest that avidity contributes significantly to high affinity receptor binding both at the biosensor and cell surfaces. Finally, we demonstrated that the coiled-coil immobilization approach does not require the purification of the captured protein, making it an attractive tool for the rapid study of any protein-protein interaction.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A polypeptide corresponding to the extracellular domain of protease-activated receptor 3 (PAR-3) is hydrolyzed by thrombin slowly because of high K(M) (>100 microM). However, thrombin is found to bind two PAR-3, one without catalyzing hydrolysis or blocking the active site, while the other is hydrolyzed. In a solvent lacking Na(+), hydrolysis of a nitroanilide substrate is enhanced 1.6-fold by addition of PAR-3 polypeptide, with half-saturation at 2.5 microM. In contrast, the fibrinogen clotting activity of thrombin is inhibited completely by PAR-3, with a K(I) of 3 microM. None of the activities of thrombin are affected by addition of 50 microM PAR-4 polypeptide. Thus, PAR-3 in low concentrations binds thrombin in a configuration that blocks the anion-binding exosite but not the catalytic site, while hydrolysis of PAR-3, PAR-4, and other substrates that do not interact with exosite I persists. The allosteric effect of PAR-3 is characteristic of that of Na(+).',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The Duffy Ag expressed on RBCs, capillaries, and postcapillary venular endothelial cells binds selective CXC and CC chemokines with high affinity. Cells transfected with the Duffy Ag internalize but do not degrade chemokine ligand. It has been proposed that Duffy Ag transports chemokines across the endothelium. We hypothesized that Duffy Ag participates in the movement of chemokines across the endothelium and, by doing so, modifies neutrophil transmigration. We found that the Duffy Ag transfected into human endothelial cells facilitates movement of the radiolabeled CXC chemokine, growth related oncogene-alpha/CXC chemokine ligand 1 (GRO-alpha/CXCL1), across an endothelial monolayer. In addition, neutrophil migration toward GRO-alpha/CXCL1 and IL-8 (IL-8/CXCL8) was enhanced across an endothelial monolayer expressing the Duffy Ag. Furthermore, GRO-alpha/CXCL1 stimulation of endothelial cells expressing the Duffy Ag did not affect gene expression by oligonucleotide microarray analysis. These in vitro observations are supported by the finding that IL-8/CXCL8-driven neutrophil recruitment into the lungs was markedly attenuated in transgenic mice lacking the Duffy Ag. We conclude that Duffy Ag has a role in enhancing leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation by facilitating movement of chemokines across the endothelium.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CCN1 (cysteine-rich 61) and CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor) are growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene products found in atherosclerotic lesions, restenosed blood vessels, and healing cutaneous wounds. Both CCN proteins have been shown to support cell adhesion and induce cell migration through interaction with integrin receptors. Recently, we have identified integrin alphaMbeta2 as the major adhesion receptor mediating monocyte adhesion to CCN1 and CCN2 and have shown that the alphaMI domain binds specifically to both proteins. In the present study, we demonstrated that activated monocytes adhered to a synthetic peptide (CCN1-H2, SSVKKYRPKYCGS) derived from a conserved region within the CCN1 C-terminal domain, and this process was blocked by the anti-alphaM monoclonal antibody 2LPM19c. Consistently, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the alphaMI domain (GST-alphaMI) bound to immobilized CCN1-H2 as well as to the corresponding H2 sequence in CCN2 (CCN2-H2, TSVKTYRAKFCGV). By contrast, a scrambled CCN1-H2 peptide and an 18-residue peptide derived from an adjacent sequence of CCN1-H2 failed to support monocyte adhesion or alphaMI domain binding. To confirm that the CCN1-H2 sequence within the CCN1 protein mediates alphaMbeta2 interaction, we developed an anti-peptide antibody against CCN1-H2 and showed that it specifically blocked GST-alphaMI binding to intact CCN1. Collectively, these results identify the H2 sequence in CCN1 and CCN2 as a novel integrin alphaMbeta2 binding motif that bears no apparent homology to any alphaMbeta2 binding sequence reported to date.',\n",

We examined here whether Tage4, which was originally identified to be a gene overexpressed in colon carcinoma and has a domain structure similar to those of nectins, is involved in cell adhesion and/or migration. Tage4 heterophilically trans-interacted with nectin-3, but not homophilically with Tage4. Expression of Tage4 was markedly elevated in NIH3T3 cells transformed by an oncogenic Ki-Ras (V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells) as compared with that of wild-type NIH3T3 cells. trans-Interaction of Tage4 with nectin-3 enhanced motility of V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells. Tage4 did not bind afadin, a nectin- and actin filament-binding protein that connects nectins to the actin cytoskeleton and cadherins through catenins. Thus, Tage4 heterophilically trans-interacts with nectin-3 and regulates cell migration.

A single nucleotide polymorphism 1469G-->A, results in a nonconservative change in codon 3 (CXCR6-E3K) of the N-terminus of the coreceptor. To investigate the relation between the chemokine receptor CXCR6 genotype and progression to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and from PCP to death, we clinically assessed and genotyped 805 individuals from an African-American injection drug-using cohort in Baltimore, MD, USA, for this CXCR6-E3K polymorphism. The allele frequency of CXCR6-3K was high (44%) in African Americans and rare in European Americans (f<1%). Although time to AIDS and PCP was similar for all CXCR6 genotypes, the median survival time from PCP to death for the CXCR6-3E/E and CXCR6-3E/K genotype was 1.5 years compared to 3.1 years for the CXCR6-K/K genotype. Individuals homozygous or heterozygous for the CXCR6-3E allele were 5.6 times more likely to die a PCP-mediated AIDS-related death than were individuals homozygous for CXCR6-3K. This study shows an association between CXCR6 genotype and progression from PCP to death among African-Americans with HIV. We suggest that CXCR6 may play a role in late-stage HIV-1 infection and may alter the progression to death after initial infection with PCP.',\n",

Recently, expression of EphA4 in the developing cochlea was shown, with strong expression in cells lining the osseous spiral lamina (OSL) through which afferent dendrites must pass to reach the organ of Corti (OC). It was also demonstrated that ephrin-B2 and -B3, both of which are known to interact with EphA4, are expressed by spiral ganglion (SG) neurons. To investigate the functional role of EphA4 in the development of inner ear neurons, neonatal rat SG explants were cultured for 72 hours on uniformly coated surfaces or near stripes of EphA4/IgG-Fc-chimera. Control explants were cultured on or near IgG-Fc and EphA1/IgG-Fc-chimera. To assess the roles of ephrin-B2 and -B3 in EphA4 signaling, SG explants were cultured with or without anti-ephrin-B2 and/or -B3 blocking antibodies. Growth patterns of SG neurites at the border of EphA4 receptor stripes showed repulsion, characterized by turning, stopping and/or reversal. In the case of IgG-Fc and EphA1, the neurites grew straight onto the stripes. Treatment with either anti-ephrin-B2 or -B3 blocking antibodies significantly reduced the repulsive effect of an EphA4 stripe. Moreover, when both antibodies were used together, neurites crossed onto EphA4 stripes with no evidence of repulsion. The results suggest that EphA4 provides repulsive signals to SG neurites in the developing cochlea, and that ephrin-B2 and -B3 together mediate this response.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) accounts for one of the first cytokine activities to have been described, and it has emerged recently to be an important regulator of innate and adaptive immunity. MIF is an upstream activator of monocytes/macrophages, and it is centrally involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock, arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions. The protein is encoded by a unique but highly conserved gene, and X-ray crystallography studies have shown MIF to define a new protein fold and structural superfamily. Although recent work has begun to illuminate the signal transduction pathways activated by MIF, the nature of its membrane receptor has not been known. Using expression cloning and functional analysis, we report herein that CD74, a Type II transmembrane protein, is a high-affinity binding protein for MIF. MIF binds to the extracellular domain of CD74, and CD74 is required for MIF-induced activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 MAP kinase cascade, cell proliferation, and PGE2 production. A recombinant, soluble form of CD74 binds MIF with a dissociation constant of approximately 9 x 10-9 Kd, as defined by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore analysis), and soluble CD74 inhibits MIF-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in defined cell systems. These data provide a molecular basis for MIF's interaction with target cells and identify it as a natural ligand for CD74, which has been implicated previously in signaling and accessory functions for immune cell activation.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The chemokines CXCL9/Mig, CXCL10/IP-10, and CXCL11/I-TAC regulate lymphocyte chemotaxis, mediate vascular pericyte proliferation, and act as angiostatic agents, thus inhibiting tumor growth. These multiple activities are apparently mediated by a unique G protein-coupled receptor, termed CXCR3. The chemokine CXCL4/PF4 shares several activities with CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, including a powerful angiostatic effect, but its specific receptor is still unknown. Here, we describe a distinct, previously unrecognized receptor named CXCR3-B, derived from an alternative splicing of the CXCR3 gene that mediates the angiostatic activity of CXCR3 ligands and also acts as functional receptor for CXCL4. Human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1), transfected with either the known CXCR3 (renamed CXCR3-A) or CXCR3-B, bound CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, whereas CXCL4 showed high affinity only for CXCR3-B. Overexpression of CXCR3-A induced an increase of survival, whereas overexpression of CXCR3-B dramatically reduced DNA synthesis and up-regulated apoptotic HMEC-1 death through activation of distinct signal transduction pathways. Remarkably, primary cultures of human microvascular endothelial cells, whose growth is inhibited by CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL4, expressed CXCR3-B, but not CXCR3-A. Finally, monoclonal antibodies raised to selectively recognize CXCR3-B reacted with endothelial cells from neoplastic tissues, providing evidence that CXCR3-B is also expressed in vivo and may account for the angiostatic effects of CXC chemokines.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Blood coagulation is triggered by the formation of a complex between factor VIIa (FVIIa) and its cofactor, tissue factor (TF). TF-FVIIa is inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in two steps: first TFPI is bound to the active site of factor Xa (FXa), and subsequently FXa-TFPI exerts feedback inhibition of TF-FVIIa. The FXa-dependent inhibition of TF-FVIIa activity by TFPI leads to formation of the quaternary complex TF-FVIIa-FXa-TFPI. We used site-directed fluorescence probing to map part of the region of soluble TF (sTF) that interacts with FXa in sTF-FVIIa-FXa-TFPI. We found that the C-terminal region of sTF, including positions 163, 166, 200 and 201, is involved in binding to FXa in the complex, and FXa, most likely via its Gla domain, is also in contact with the Gla domain of FVIIa in this part of the binding region. Furthermore, a region that includes the N-terminal part of the TF2 domain and the C-terminal part of the TF1 domain, i.e. the residues 104 and 197, participates in the interaction with FXa in the quaternary complex. Moreover, comparisons of the interaction areas between sTF and FX(a) in the quaternary complex sTF-FVIIa-FXa-TFPI and in the ternary complexes sTF-FVII-FXa or sTF-FVIIa-FX demonstrated large similarities.',\n",

TWEAK is a cell surface-associated type II transmembrane protein, but a smaller, biologically active form can also be shed into the extracellular milieu. There is one receptor currently known to bind TWEAK with physiological affinity, and it is a type I transmembrane protein that is referred to in the literature as either TWEAK receptor (TweakR) or fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14). TweakR/Fn14 is the smallest member of the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily described to date, and it appears to signal via recruitment of several different TNFR-associated factors. TWEAK has multiple biological activities, including stimulation of cell growth and angiogenesis, induction of inflammatory cytokines, and under some experimental conditions, stimulation of apoptosis. In this report, we summarize the results from recent studies focused on the TWEAK cytokine. Although these studies have contributed a significant amount of new information, numerous questions still remain regarding the role of TWEAK in both normal physiology and the pathogenesis of human disease.',\n",

It is not clear how KIR, whose function lies downstream of a tyrosine kinase, succeeds in blocking proximal NK cell activation signals upon binding HLA class I on target cells. Here we show that mixing NK cells with insect cells expressing HLA-C was sufficient to induce clustering of KIR, and phosphorylation of KIR and SHP-1. Transient phosphorylation of KIR was detected in the presence of pervanadate, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, at suboptimal concentration. Phosphorylation of KIR was specifically induced by ligand binding because it was detected only when HLA-C was loaded with a peptide that permits KIR binding. KIR phosphorylation was not dependent on ICAM-1-mediated adhesion and was not blocked by inhibition of actin polymerization, but required Zn(2+). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between HLA-C molecules revealed close molecular interactions induced by KIR binding. These results demonstrate tight clustering of KIR and rapid KIR phosphorylation induced simply by binding to HLA-C. The unique property of KIR to become phosphorylated in the absence of adhesion and of actin cytoskeleton rearrangement explains how KIR can efficiently block early activation signals during NK-target cell contacts.',\n",

We show here that the native M3 muscarinic receptor in 1321N1 cells and an epitope-tagged M3 receptor expressed in COS7 cells substantially utilize an ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-dependent route of PLD activation. This pathway is activated at the plasma membrane but appears to be largely independent of G, phospholipase C, Ca2+ q/11, protein kinase C, tyrosine kinases, and phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase. We report instead that it involves physical association of ARF with the M3 receptor as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and by in vitro interaction with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the receptor's third intracellular loop domain. Experiments with mutant constructs of ARF1/6 and PLD1/2 indicate that the M3 receptor displays a major ARF1-dependent route of PLD1 activation with an additional ARF6-dependent pathway to PLD1 or PLD2. Examples of other G protein-coupled receptors assessed in comparison display alternative pathways of protein kinase C- or ARF6-dependent activation of PLD2.\",\n",

Levels of adiponectin in the blood are decreased under conditions of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Administration of adiponectin causes glucose-lowering effects and ameliorates insulin resistance in mice. Conversely, adiponectin-deficient mice exhibit insulin resistance and diabetes. This insulin-sensitizing effect of adiponectin seems to be mediated by an increase in fatty-acid oxidation through activation of AMP kinase and PPAR-alpha. Here we report the cloning of complementary DNAs encoding adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) by expression cloning. AdipoR1 is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas AdipoR2 is predominantly expressed in the liver. These two adiponectin receptors are predicted to contain seven transmembrane domains, but to be structurally and functionally distinct from G-protein-coupled receptors. Expression of AdipoR1/R2 or suppression of AdipoR1/R2 expression by small-interfering RNA supports our conclusion that they serve as receptors for globular and full-length adiponectin, and that they mediate increased AMP kinase and PPAR-alpha ligand activities, as well as fatty-acid oxidation and glucose uptake by adiponectin.',\n",

Netrins interact with members of two distinct families of transmembrane receptors, represented by DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) and UNC5. A human netrin fragment (soluble netrin; sNetrin) was purified from an engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line and used in a pull-down assay to map the interactions between netrin and its receptors. We find that sNetrin binds exclusively to the fifth fibronectin type III repeat of DCC and to each immunoglobulin repeat of UNC5. Both DCC and UNC5 bind to sNetrin with 1:1 stoichiometry in solution, and the minimal receptor fragments behave similarly to larger fragments in cross-linking experiments with purified sNetrin. We find no evidence for formation of a ternary complex between sNetrin and soluble forms of DCC and UNC5. We also find no evidence for an interaction between DCC and heparin and instead demonstrate that a loop on the fifth fibronectin type III repeat of DCC previously implicated in mediating interactions with heparin is important for sNetrin binding.

Bovine milk LPL displaced both 125I-labeled alpha 2M* and 39-kDa alpha 2M receptor-associated protein (RAP) from the surface of cultured mutant fibroblasts lacking LDL receptors with apparent KI values at 4 degrees C of 6.8 and 30 nM, respectively. Furthermore, LPL inhibited the cellular degradation of 125I-alpha 2M* at 37 degrees C. Because both alpha 2M* and RAP interact with LRP, these data suggest that LPL binds specifically to this receptor. This was further supported by observing that an immunoaffinity-isolated polyclonal antibody against LRP blocked cellular degradation of 125I-LPL in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, 125I-LPL bound to highly purified LRP in a solid-phase assay with a KD of 18 nM, and this binding could be partially displaced with alpha 2M* (KI = 7 nM) and RAP (KI = 3 nM). Taken together, these data establish that LPL binds with high affinity to LRP and undergoes LRP-mediated cellular uptake. The implication of these findings for lipoprotein catabolism in vivo may be important if LRP binding is preserved when LPL is attached to lipoproteins.

To examine the molecular mechanisms by which Notch regulates vascular development, we analyzed changes in gene expression in response to Notch signaling. Notch signal transduction and function were assessed in primary human endothelial cells isolated from the dermal microvasculature of neonates, HMVECd. We demonstrate that HMVECd cells express a heterodimeric form of endogenous Notch4 on their cell surface. Using an in vitro coculture assay, we found that Delta4 can function as a ligand for Notch4 in HMVECd cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of an activated allele of Notch4 upregulated the expression of Delta4, suggesting that there may be a regulatory loop between Notch4 and its ligand, Delta4. Notch4 activation also induced the expression of the transcriptional repressors, HES1, HERP1, and HERP2, as well as ephrinB2, an angiogenic factor proposed to be involved in arterial/venous endothelial cell specification.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Agouti-related protein (AGRP) is an endogenous antagonist of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) that functions in the hypothalamic control of feeding behavior. Our previous studies have suggested that in addition to exoloops 2 and 3, several transmembrane domains of MC4R may be important for AGRP binding. However, the detailed molecular basis of MC4R domains in AGRP binding is presently unclear. The present studies were designed to determine the specific contribution of MC4R exoloops and transmembrane domains to AGRP binding by using chimeric receptor constructs of the human melanocortin-1 receptor (hMC1R), a receptor that is not inhibited by AGRP, and the human MC4R (hMC4R), a receptor that is potently inhibited by AGRP. Our results indicate that substitutions of the second and third extracellular loops of the MC4R with homologous domains of the MC1R dramatically decreased AGRP 87-132 binding affinity, but did not affect AGRP 110-117 binding affinity. In contrast, cassette substitutions of the third or fourth transmembrane domain of the MC4R with the homologous domain of the MC1R resulted in a substantial decrease of AGRP 87-132 binding affinity and loss of AGRP 110-117 binding affinity. These data suggest that the AGRP fragment 110-117 has no binding sites at exoloops of hMC4R and that transmembrane domains of MC4R may play an important role in AGRP 110-117 binding and function, whereas the exoloops do not. The second and third extracellular loops of MC4R are important for AGRP 87-132 N-terminal binding, whereas the third and fourth transmembrane domains of hMC4R are crucial for AGRP 110-117 binding.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'During inflammatory states, hepatocytes are induced to synthesize and secrete a group of proteins called acute-phase proteins. It has recently been shown that besides interleukin-6 (IL-6), related cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostation M and interleukin-11 are also mediators of the hepatic acute-phase response. All these mediators belong to the hematopoietic family of alpha-helical cytokines. Here we show that an additional member of this cytokine family, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), induces the hepatic acute-phase protein genes haptoglobin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin and beta-fibrinogen in human hepatoma cells (HepG2) and in primary rat hepatocytes with a time course and dose-response comparable with that of IL-6. Our next aim was to define the receptor components used by CNTF on hepatic cells. Using a cell-free binding assay we exclude that CNTF binds to the 80 kDa IL-6 receptor, a protein with significant homology to the CNTF receptor which has recently been cloned from neuroblastoma cells. In human hepatoma cells (Hep3B) which lack the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, CNTF was not able to induce acute-phase protein synthesis, indicating that this receptor protein may be part of the functional CNTF receptor on hepatic cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Thrombospondin (TSP) signals focal adhesion disassembly (the intermediate adhesive state) through interactions with cell surface calreticulin (CRT). TSP or a peptide (hep I) of the active site induces focal adhesion disassembly through binding to CRT, which activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) through Galphai2 proteins. Because CRT is not a transmembrane protein, it is likely that CRT signals as part of a coreceptor complex. We now show that low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) mediates focal adhesion disassembly initiated by TSP binding to CRT. LRP antagonists (antibodies, receptor-associated protein) block hep I/TSP-induced focal adhesion disassembly. LRP is necessary for TSP/hep I signaling because TSP/hep I is unable to stimulate focal adhesion disassembly or ERK or PI3K signaling in fibroblasts deficient in LRP. LRP is important in TSP-CRT signaling, as shown by the ability of hep I to stimulate association of Galphai2 with LRP. The isolated proteins LRP and CRT interact, and LRP and CRT are associated with hep I in molecular complexes extracted from cells. These data establish a mechanism of cell surface CRT signaling through its coreceptor, LRP, and suggest a novel function for LRP in regulating cell adhesion.',\n",

Ang-(1-7) has become an angiotensin of interest in the past few years, because its cardiovascular and baroreflex actions counteract those of Ang II. Unique angiotensin-binding sites specific for this heptapeptide and studies with a selective Ang-(1-7) antagonist indicated the existence of a distinct Ang-(1-7) receptor. We demonstrate that genetic deletion of the G protein-coupled receptor encoded by the Mas protooncogene abolishes the binding of Ang-(1-7) to mouse kidneys. Accordingly, Mas-deficient mice completely lack the antidiuretic action of Ang-(1-7) after an acute water load. Ang-(1-7) binds to Mas-transfected cells and elicits arachidonic acid release. Furthermore, Mas-deficient aortas lose their Ang-(1-7)-induced relaxation response.

TARC interacts primarily with the CCR4 receptor and to a lesser extent with the CCR8 receptor. The structures of TARC have been solved by molecular replacement in two space groups, triclinic (P1) and tetragonal (P4(1)), and refined to resolutions of 1.72 and 2.1 A, respectively, with R factors of 19.8% (R(free) = 24.1%) and 19.8% (R(free) = 27.7%), respectively. The search model originated from the crystal structure of another chemokine, RANTES, and proved to be only modestly similar to the refined structure of TARC. Whereas the tetragonal structure was easily solved using the program AMoRe, solution of the triclinic structure proved to be quite challenging and was obtained by combining the results from four different molecular-replacement programs (AMoRe, CNS, BEAST and EPMR), with subsequent extension of the gathered information. The tertiary structure of TARC is similar to that of other CC chemokines, with a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet flanked by a C-terminal helix. Both quaternary structures consist of dimers, which in the triclinic crystals pack further into tetramers. The TARC dimers are similar to those observed previously in the crystal structures of both MCP-1 and RANTES.',\n",

Here, we show that the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM can function as a signaling receptor for members of the GDNF ligand family. Association of NCAM with GFRalpha1, a GPI-anchored receptor for GDNF, downregulates NCAM-mediated cell adhesion and promotes high-affinity binding of GDNF to p140(NCAM), resulting in rapid activation of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases Fyn and FAK in cells lacking RET, a known GDNF signaling receptor. GDNF stimulates Schwann cell migration and axonal growth in hippocampal and cortical neurons via binding to NCAM and activation of Fyn, but independently of RET. These results uncover an unexpected intersection between short- and long-range mechanisms of intercellular communication and reveal a pathway for GDNF signaling that does not require the RET receptor.',\n",

Northern blot analysis demonstrated that UGRP1 is specifically expressed by lung, but not by the other tissues examined. By in situ hybridization experiments, UGRP1 was shown to be expressed by lung Clara-like cells in the bronchial epithelium and to be up-regulated in cystic fibrosis. In a mammalian expression system, secreted recombinant UGRP1 was copurified with apolipoprotein A-I. Using a retroviral vector-mediated expression cloning approach, we identified macrophage scavenger receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) as a receptor for UGRP1. Northern blot and in situ hybridization experiments indicated that MARCO is expressed by alveolar macrophages in the lung. UGRP1 also bound to bacteria and yeast.

Both ILTs contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory receptor motifs in their cytoplasmic tails that inhibit cellular responses by recruiting phosphatases such as SHP-1 (Src homology 2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase 1). Although these ILTs have been shown to recognize a broad range of classical and nonclassical human MHC class I molecules (MHCIs), their precise binding properties remain controversial. We have used surface plasmon resonance to analyze the interaction of soluble forms of ILT4 and ILT2 with several MHCIs. Although the range of affinities measured was quite broad (Kd = 2-45 microM), some interesting differences were observed. ILT2 generally bound with a 2- to 3-fold higher affinity than ILT4 to the same MHCI. Furthermore, ILT2 and ILT4 bound to HLA-G with a 3- to 4-fold higher affinity than to classical MHCIs, suggesting that ILT/HLA-G recognition may play a dominant role in the regulation of natural killer, T, and myelomonocytic cell activation. Finally, we show that ILT2 and ILT4 effectively compete with CD8 for MHCI binding, raising the possibility that ILT2 modulates CD8+ T cell activation by blocking the CD8 binding as well as by recruiting inhibitory molecules through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory receptor motif.',\n",

In mammals, 19 genes encoding Wingless and Int-related factor (WNTs), 10 encoding Frizzled, and 2 encoding LRP proteins have been identified, but little is known of the identities of individual Frizzled-LRP combinations mediating the effects of specific WNT factors. Additionally, several secreted modulators of WNT signaling have been identified, including at least three members of the Dickkopf family. WNT7A is a WNT family member expressed in the vertebrate central nervous system capable of modulating aspects of neuronal plasticity. Gene knock-out models in the mouse have revealed that WNT7A plays a role in cerebellar maturation, although its function in the development of distal limb structures and of the reproductive tract have been more intensely studied. To identify a receptor complex for this WNT family member, we have analyzed the response of the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 to WNT7A. We find that PC12 cells are capable of responding to WNT7A as measured by increased beta-catenin stability and activation of a T-cell factor-based luciferase reporter construct and that these cells express three members of the Frizzled family (Frizzled-2, -5, and -7) and LRP6.

Accordingly, the mutated HLA-G transfectants were less effective in the inhibition of NK killing and RBL/LIR-1 induced serotonin release. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the involvement of the cysteine residues in the formation of HLA-G protein oligomers on the cell surface. The cysteine residue located at position 42 is shown to be critical for the expression of such complexes.

Migration of HT1080 cells expressing hOT7T175 that harbor a high-level MMP activity was only slightly suppressed by either metastin decapeptide or MMP inhibitor BB-94 alone, but the combination of metastin decapeptide and BB-94 showed a synergistic effect in blocking cell migration.

In this study, we have identified five tyrosyl phosphorylation sites in the VEGFR-3 carboxyl-terminal tail. These sites were used both in VEGFR-3 overexpressed in 293 cells and when the endogenous VEGFR-3 was activated in lymphatic endothelial cells. Interestingly, VEGF-C stimulation of lymphatic endothelial cells also induced the formation of VEGFR-3/VEGFR-2 heterodimers, in which VEGFR-3 was phosphorylated only at three of the five sites while the two most carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues appeared not to be accessible for the VEGFR-2 kinase. Our data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal tail of VEGFR-3 provides important regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation sites with potential signal transduction capacity and that these sites are differentially used in ligand-induced homo- and heterodimeric receptor complexes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CD100/Sema4D belongs to the semaphorin family, factors known to act as repulsive cues for axons during neuronal development. Mouse CD100 plays a crucial role in both humoral and cellular immunity through ligation of the lymphocyte receptor, CD72. It remains controversial, however, whether human CD100 can function through human CD72 in a manner similar to mouse CD100. To determine the function of human CD100, we generated a recombinant soluble human CD100 protein comprised of the extracellular region of human CD100 fused to the human IgG1 Fc region (hCD100-Fc). hCD100-Fc specifically binds to cells expressing human CD72. As observed previously in the mouse, hCD100-Fc induces the tyrosine dephosphorylation of human CD72, leading to the dissociation of SHP-1 from the CD72 cytoplasmic tail. Consistent with findings for mouse CD100, hCD100-Fc exerts a co-stimulatory effect on B cells and dendritic cells that are stimulated with anti-CD40 mAb. Furthermore, both hCD100-Fc and anti-human CD72 agonistic mAb induce the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8, even in the absence of anti-CD40 mAb. Collectively, our findings not only demonstrate that human CD100, interacting with human CD72, can function as a ligand in a manner similar to mouse CD100, but also suggest the involvement of human CD100 in inflammatory responses.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is predominantly expressed on T lymphocytes, and its agonists CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 are IFN-gamma-inducible chemokines that promote Th1 responses. In contrast, the CCR3 agonists CCL11, CCL24 and CCL26 are involved in the recruitment of cells such as eosinophils and basophils during Th2 responses. Here, we report that although CCL11, CCL24 and CCL26 are neither agonists nor antagonists of CXCR3, CCL11 binds with high affinity to CXCR3. This suggests that, in vivo, CXCR3 may act as a decoy receptor, sequestering locally produced CCL11. We also demonstrate that the CXCR3 ligands inhibit CCR3-mediated functional responses of both human eosinophils and CCR3 transfectants induced by all three eotaxins, with CXCL11 being the most efficacious antagonist. The examination of CCR3-CCR1 chimeric constructs revealed that CCL11 and CXCL11 share overlapping binding sites contained within the CCR3 extracellular loops, a region that was previously shown to be essential for effective receptor-activation. Hence, eosinophil responses mediated by chemokines acting at CCR3 may be regulated by two distinct mechanisms: the antagonistic effects of CXCR3 ligands and the sequestration of CCL11 by CXCR3-expressing cells. Such interplay may serve to finely tune inflammatory responses in vivo.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'During lymphocyte homing to secondary lymphoid organs and instances of inflammatory trafficking, the rolling of leukocytes on vascular endothelium is mediated by transient interactions between L-selectin on leukocytes and several carbohydrate-modified ligands on the endothelium. Most L-selectin ligands such as CD34 and podocalyxin present sulfated carbohydrate structures (6-sulfated sialyl Lewis x or 6-sulfo-sLex) as a recognition determinant within their heavily glycosylated mucin domains. We recently identified endoglycan as a new member of the CD34 family. We report here that endoglycan, like the two other members of this family (CD34 and podocalyxin) can function as a L-selectin ligand. However, endoglycan employs a different binding mechanism, interacting with L-selectin through sulfation on two tyrosine residues and O-linked sLex structures that are presented within its highly acidic amino-terminal region. Our analysis establishes striking parallels with PSGL-1, a leukocyte ligand that interacts with all three selectins, mediating leukocyte-endothelial, leukocyte-leukocyte, and platelet-leukocyte interactions. Since the distribution of endoglycan includes hematopoietic precursors and leukocyte subpopulations, in addition to endothelial cells, our findings suggest several potential settings for endoglycan-mediated adhesion events.',\n",

We demonstrate here that wild-type LRP6 forms an inactive dimer through interactions mediated by epidermal growth factor repeat regions within the extracellular domain. A truncated LRP6 comprising its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains is expressed as a constitutively active monomer whose signaling ability is inhibited by forced dimerization. Conversely, Wnts are shown to activate canonical signaling through LRP6 by inducing an intracellular conformational switch which relieves allosteric inhibition imposed on the intracellular domains. Thus, Wnt canonical signaling through LRP6 establishes a novel mechanism for receptor activation which is opposite to the general paradigm of ligand-induced receptor oligomerization.',\n",

ApoER2 is a cell surface molecule that elicits intracellular signal transduction through binding of Reelin. The structural requirements for Reelin binding to apoER2 and the receptor domains involved in this process are unclear at present. Using a series of receptor mutants, we characterized the interaction of apoER2 with Reelin and compared this interaction to that of apoER2 with the receptor-associated protein (RAP), an apoER2 ligand that does not induce signaling. By surface plasmon resonance we demonstrate that apoER2 exhibits 6-fold higher affinity for Reelin than the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), which also functions as a Reelin receptor (K(D) 0.2 nM versus K(D) 1.2 nM). Acidic amino acid residues in complement-type repeat domains 1 and 3 of apoER2 are required for Reelin binding. The same regions of the receptor are also bound by RAP with a 25-fold lower affinity (K(D) 5 nM). Whereas RAP binds to apoER2 with a 1:1 stoichiometry, experimental evidence suggests that Reelin associates with two or more receptor molecules simultaneously to achieve high-affinity interaction. This finding indicates that aggregation of apoER2 by multivalent ligands such as Reelin may be the structural basis for signal transduction.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'C5a anaphylatoxin, a potent inflammatory mediator, is known to act through a specific G protein coupled receptor. However, some of the complex effects of C5a in vivo may not be explained solely by the deletion of the known receptor. Here, we show that an orphan receptor, identified as C5L2, is a high affinity C5a binding protein. Unlike the previously described C5aR, C5L2 is obligately uncoupled from heterotrimeric G proteins, in part by virtue of an amino acid alteration in the so-called DRY sequence at the end of the third transmembrane segment. Both human and murine C5L2 bear a leucine for arginine replacement at this site. C5L2, when transfected into several cell types, is weakly phosphorylated in transfected cells following binding of C5a but does not induce significant activation of MAP kinases, mediate calcium flux, or stimulate chemotaxis. Bone marrow cells from wild type respond robustly to C5a with induction and suppression of a number of inflammation related genes. In contrast, C5a receptor deficient mice, which bear C5L2 alone, do not respond to C5a with changes in gene transcription by microarray analyses. Biophysical properties of the C5L2, including slow ligand on and off rates, absence of internalization, and relatively high affinity for the C5a des Arg metabolite, suggest that this receptor may serve to modulate C5a biological functions in vivo. Finally, in contrast to previous reports, we find absolutely no interaction of C5L2 with other anaphylatoxins C3a and C4a.',\n",

Neutrophil recruitment is directed by transendothelial gradients of IL-8 that, in vivo, are bound to the endothelial cell surface. We have investigated the identity and function of the binding site(s) in an in vitro model of neutrophil transendothelial migration. In endothelial culture supernatants, IL-8 was detected in a trimolecular complex with heparan sulfate and syndecan-1. Constitutive shedding of IL-8 in this form was increased in the presence of a neutralizing Ab to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), indicating a role for endothelial plasminogen activator in the shedding of IL-8. Increased shedding of IL-8/heparan sulfate/syndecan-1 complexes was accompanied by inhibition of neutrophil transendothelial migration, and aprotinin, a potent plasmin inhibitor, reversed this inhibition. Platelets, added as an exogenous source of PAI-1, had no effect on shedding of the complexes or neutrophil migration. Our results indicate that IL-8 is immobilized on the endothelial cell surface through binding to syndecan-1 ectodomains, and that plasmin, generated by endothelial plasminogen activator, induces the shedding of this form of IL-8. PAI-1 appears to stabilize the chemoattractant form of IL-8 at the cell surface and may represent a therapeutic target for novel anti-inflammatory strategies.',\n",

Here we address whether Eph receptors may also regulate dendritic cell (DC) trafficking. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that DCs derived from CD34+ progenitors, but not from monocytes, expressed several receptors, in particular EphA2, EphA4, EphA7, EphB1, and EphB3 mRNA. EphB3 was specifically expressed by Langerhans cells, and EphA2 and EphA7 were expressed by both Langerhans- and interstitial-type DCs. EphA and EphB protein expression on DCs generated in vitro was confirmed by staining with ephrin-A3-Fc and ephrin-B3-Fc fusion proteins that bind to different Eph members, in particular EphA2 and EphB3. Immunostaining with anti-EphA2 antibodies demonstrated the expression of EphA2 by immature DCs and by skin Langerhans cells isolated ex vivo. Interestingly, ephrin expression was detected in epidermal keratinocytes and also in DCs. Adhesion of CD34+-derived DCs to fibronectin, but not to poly-l-lysine, was increased in the presence of ephrin-A3-Fc, a ligand of EphA2, through a beta1 integrin activation pathway.

By measuring inositol phosphate turnover or by using a reporter assay for transcriptional activity controlled by cAMP-responsive elements, the ghrelin receptor showed strong, ligand-independent signaling in transfected COS-7 or human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Ghrelin and a number of the known nonpeptide GH secretagogues acted as agonists stimulating inositol phosphate turnover further. In contrast, the low potency ghrelin antagonist, [D-Arg1,D-Phe5,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]-substance P was surprisingly found to be a high potency (EC50 = 5.2 nm) full inverse agonist as it decreased the constitutive signaling of the ghrelin receptor down to that observed in untransfected cells. The homologous motilin receptor functioned as a negative control as it did not display any sign of constitutive activity; however, upon agonist stimulation the motilin receptor signaled as strongly as the unstimulated ghrelin receptor. It is concluded that the ghrelin receptor is highly constitutively active and that this activity could be of physiological importance in its role as a regulator of both GH secretion and appetite control.

Using synthetic peptides, LALERKDHSG was identified as an alpha6beta1-binding sequence in thrombospondin-1. This peptide inhibited alpha6beta1-dependent cell adhesion to thrombospondin-1, thrombospondin-2, and the E8 fragment of murine laminin-1. The Glu residue in this peptide was required for activity, and the corresponding residue (Glu90) in the N-terminal module of thrombospondin-1 was required for its recognition by alpha6beta1, but not by alpha4beta1. alpha6beta1 was also expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells; but in these cells, only certain agonists could activate the integrin to recognize thrombospondins. Selective activation of alpha6beta1 integrin in microvascular endothelial cells by the anti-beta1 antibody TS2/16 therefore accounts for their adhesion responses to thrombospondins and explains the distinct functions of alpha4beta1 and alpha6beta1 integrins as thrombospondin receptors in microvascular and large vessel endothelial cells.',\n",

We have observed an important correlation between receptor binding affinity and cell-cell fusion inhibitory activity.

In the absence of pituitary or hypothalamic anatomical lesions and of anosmia (Kallmann syndrome), hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). A limited number of IHH cases are due to loss-of-function mutations of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. To identify additional gene defects leading to IHH, a large consanguineous family with five affected siblings and with a normal gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor coding sequence was studied. Homozygosity whole-genome mapping allowed the localization of a new locus within the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13). Sequencing of several genes localized within this region showed that all affected siblings of the family carried a homozygous deletion of 155 nucleotides in the GPR54 gene. This deletion encompassed the splicing acceptor site of intron 4-exon 5 junction and part of exon 5. The deletion was absent or present on only one allele in unaffected family members. GPR54 has been initially identified as an orphan G protein-coupled receptor with 40% homology to galanin receptors. Recently, a 54-aa peptide derived from the KiSS1 protein was identified as a ligand of GPR54. The present study shows that loss of function of GPR54 is a cause of IHH, and it identifies GPR54 and possibly KiSS1 protein-derived peptide as playing a major and previously unsuspected role in the physiology of the gonadotropic axis.',\n",

A PTHrP(1-36) analog and a conformationally constrained PTH(1-21) analog, each containing para-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) at position 19, each cross-linked efficiently to the P1R expressed in COS-7 cells, and digestive mapping analysis localized the cross-linked site to the interval (Leu232-Lys240) at the extracellular end of TM2. Point mutation analysis identified Ala234, Val235, and Lys240 as determinants of cross-linking efficiency, and the Lys240-->Ala mutation selectively impaired the binding of PTH(1-21) and PTH(1-19) analogs, relative to that of PTH(1-15) analogs.

       "  'Title': 'Characterization of tachykinin NK2 receptor in the anterior pituitary gland.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Tachykinins are a family of bioactive peptides that interact with three subtypes of receptors: NK1, NK2 and NK3. Substance P has greater affinity for NK1, and neurokinin A (NKA) for NK2 receptor subtype. Although only NK1 receptor has been characterized in the anterior pituitary gland, some evidence suggests the existence of NK2 receptors in this gland. Therefore, we investigated the presence of NK2 receptors in the anterior pituitary gland of male rats by radioligand binding studies using labeled SR48968, a non peptidic specific antagonist. [3H]SR48968 specific binding to cultured anterior pituitary cells was time-dependent and saturable, but with a lower affinity than previously reported values for cells expressing NK2 receptors. Unlabeled NKA inhibited only partially [(3)H]SR48968 specific binding to whole anterior pituitary cells. Since SR48968 is a non polar molecule, we performed experiments to discriminate surface from intracellular binding sites. SR48968 exhibited both surface and intracellular specific binding. Analysis of the surface-bound ligand indicated that [3H]SR48968 binds to one class of receptor with high affinity. Neurokinin A completely displaced [3H]SR48968 surface specific binding fitting to a two-site/two-state model with high and low affinity. Additionally, immunocytochemical studies showed that the NK2 receptor is expressed at least in a subset of lactotropes. These results demonstrate the presence of NK2 receptors in the anterior pituitary gland and suggest that NKA actions in this gland are mediated, at least in part, by the NK2 receptor subtype.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Recruitment of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) by endothelial cells (EC) is essential for angiogenesis. Endothelial-derived heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) was shown to mediate this process by signaling via ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptors in SMCs. 1) Analysis of ErbB-ligands demonstrated that primary ECs expressed only HB-EGF and neuregulin-1. 2) Primary SMCs expressed ErbB1 and ErbB2, but not ErbB3 or ErbB4. 3) Consistent with their known receptor specificities, recombinant HB-EGF, but not neuregulin-1, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB1 and ErbB2 and migration in SMCs. 4) Neutralization of HB-EGF or inhibition of ErbB1 or ErbB2 blocked 70-90% of the potential of ECs to stimulate SMC migration. Moreover, 5) angiopoietin-1, an EC effector with a role in recruitment of SMC-like cells to vascular structures in vivo, enhanced EC-stimulated SMC migration by a mechanism involving up-regulation of endothelial HB-EGF. Finally, 6) immunohistochemical analysis of developing human tissues demonstrated that HB-EGF was expressed in vivo in ECs associated with SMCs or pericytes but not in ECs of the hyaloid vessels not associated with SMCs. These results suggest an important role for HB-EGF and ErbB receptors in the recruitment of SMCs by ECs and elaborate on the mechanism by which angiopoietins exert their vascular effects.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CD200 (OX2) is a broadly distributed cell surface glycoprotein that interacts with a structurally related receptor (CD200R) expressed on rodent myeloid cells and is involved in regulation of macrophage function. We report the first characterization of human CD200R (hCD200R) and define its binding characteristics to hCD200. We also report the identification of a closely related gene to hCD200R, designated hCD200RLa, and four mouse CD200R-related genes (termed mCD200RLa-d). CD200, CD200R, and CD200R-related genes were closely linked in humans and mice, suggesting that these genes arose by gene duplication. The distributions of the receptor genes were determined by quantitative RT-PCR, and protein expression was confirmed by a set of novel mAbs. The distribution of mouse and human CD200R was similar, with strongest labeling of macrophages and neutrophils, but also other leukocytes, including monocytes, mast cells, and T lymphocytes. Two mCD200 receptor-like family members, designated mCD200RLa and mCD200RLb, were shown to pair with the activatory adaptor protein, DAP12, suggesting that these receptors would transmit strong activating signals in contrast to the apparent inhibitory signal delivered by triggering the CD200R. Despite substantial sequence homology with mCD200R, mCD200RLa and mCD200RLb did not bind mCD200, and presently have unknown ligands. The CD200 receptor gene family resembles the signal regulatory proteins and killer Ig-related receptors in having receptor family members with potential activatory and inhibitory functions that may play important roles in immune regulation and balance. Because manipulation of the CD200-CD200R interaction affects the outcome of rodent disease models, targeting of this pathway may have therapeutic utility.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Mast cells are the central mediating cells of allergic reactions. Binding of allergen specific IgE to high affinity IgE receptor (Fcepsilon RI) and subsequent binding of allergen by the IgE causes receptor cross-linking and activation. In a study examining the differential gene expression in human cord blood-derived mast cells (CBMCs) mediated by activation of Fcepsilon RI both with IgE and IgE followed by cross-linking with alpha-IgE, the chemokine I-309 was found to be upregulated. I-309 is the ligand for the CCR8 receptor and is responsible for chemoattraction of TH2 type T-cells. Interestingly, I-309 RNA and protein levels were elevated not only in response to IgE/alpha-IgE activation but also by IgE alone. In addition, the I-309 levels were augmented by growth of the CBMCs in the presence of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-4. GM-CSF and MIP-1alpha secretion was also induced by IgE. These results suggest that IgE, through the production and release of cytokines such as I-309, GM-CSF and MIP-1alpha could promote an inflammatory reaction in the absence of antigen stimulation of mast cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': '(1) Partial agonism is primarily dependent upon receptor density and coupling efficiency. As these parameters are tissue/model dependent, intrinsic activity in different tissues can vary. We have utilised the ecdysone-inducible expression system containing the human nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide receptor (hNOP) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOINDhNOP) to examine the activity of a range of partial agonists in receptor binding, GTPgamma35S binding and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase studies. (2) Incubation of CHOINDhNOP cells with ponasterone A (PON) induced hNOP expression ([leucyl-3H]N/OFQ binding) of 24, 68, 191 and 1101 fmol mg-1 protein at 1, 2, 5 and 10 microm PON, respectively. At 191 fmol mg-1, protein hNOP pharmacology was identical to that reported for other traditional expression systems. (3) pEC50 values for GTPgamma35S binding ranged from 7.23 to 7.72 (2-10 microm PON) for the partial agonist [Phe1psi(CH2-NH)Gly2]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 ([F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2) and 8.12-8.60 (1-10 microm PON) for N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and Emax values (stimulation factor relative to basal) ranged from 1.51 to 3.21 (2-10 microm PON) for [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and 1.28-6.95 (1-10 microm) for N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2. Intrinsic activity of [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 relative to N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 was 0.3-0.5. [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 did not stimulate GTPgamma35S binding at 1 microm PON, but competitively antagonised the effects of N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 with a pKB=7.62. (4) pEC50 values for cAMP inhibition ranged from 8.26 to 8.32 (2-10 microm PON) for [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and 9.42-10.35 for N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and Emax values (% inhibition) ranged from 19.6 to 83.2 for [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 and 40.9-86.0 for N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2. The intrinsic activity of [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 relative to N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 was 0.48-0.97. (5) In the same cellular environment with receptor density as the only variable, we show that the profile of [F/G]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH2 can be manipulated to encompass full and partial agonism along with antagonism.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The endothelin B receptor (ETB) is an endothelial cell receptor found in caveolae. Studies with GFP-tagged ETB have suggested that the protein is constitutively endocytosed and targeted to lysosomes where it is rapidly degraded. We report that iodinated endothelin-1 ligand (ET-1) is taken up by cells transfected with ETB and remains undegraded for at least 17 h. Analysis of the intracellular traffic of endocytosed ET-1 on isotonic Ficoll gradients shows that it is rapidly internalised to lysosomes by a chloroquine sensitive and cholesterol dependent pathway. Low-temperature nonreducing SDS gels show that the ET-1 initially binds to full-length GFP-tagged ETB, which is rapidly clipped at the amino-terminus and is then stable for at least 6 h. Analysis of GFP tagged ETB on reducing SDS gels shows that it is proteolytically cleaved with a half time of approximately 3 h. However, nonreducing gels show that the receptor is virtually intact, suffering only a similar cleavage to the liganded receptor. We conclude that the ETB receptor shows remarkable stability in lysosomes, held together by disulfide bonds, and maintaining ligand binding for long periods of time.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Myelination results in a highly segregated distribution of axonal membrane proteins at nodes of Ranvier. Here, we show the role in this process of TAG-1, a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol-anchored cell adhesion molecule. In the absence of TAG-1, axonal Caspr2 did not accumulate at juxtaparanodes, and the normal enrichment of shaker-type K+ channels in these regions was severely disrupted, in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In contrast, the localization of protein 4.1B, an axoplasmic partner of Caspr2, was only moderately altered. TAG-1, which is expressed in both neurons and glia, was able to associate in cis with Caspr2 and in trans with itself. Thus, a tripartite intercellular protein complex, comprised of these two proteins, appears critical for axo-glial contacts at juxtaparanodes. This complex is analogous to that described previously at paranodes, suggesting that similar molecules are crucial for different types of axo-glial interactions.',\n",

Using these receptor preparations, we examined the binding affinities of ANP, BNP, and CNP for the C-receptor and their potencies for cGMP production via the ANP-A receptor (GC-A) and the ANP-B receptor (GC-B). These analyses revealed the presence of a marked species difference in the receptor selectivity of the natriuretic peptide family, especially among BNPs. Therefore, we investigated the receptor selectivity of the natriuretic peptide family using the homologous assay system with endogenous ligands and receptors of the same species. The rank order of binding affinity for the C-receptor was ANP greater than CNP greater than BNP in both humans and rats. The rank order of potency for cGMP production via the ANP-A receptor (GC-A) was ANP greater than or equal to BNP much greater than CNP, but that via the ANP-B receptor (GC-B) was CNP greater than ANP greater than or equal to BNP. These findings on the receptor selectivity of the natriuretic peptide family provide a new insight into the understanding of the physiological and clinical implications of the natriuretic peptide system.',\n",

In contrast, the binding of eledoisin to the NK3 receptor expressed in the transfected CHO cells was of low affinity (IC50 = 240 nM) compared to the high affinity of the receptor found when it was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (IC50 = 8 nM). However, in both cases the receptor exhibited the specificity of a classical NK3 receptor.

The position of intron-exon junctions are identical to those in other reported neurokinin genes. Using a chimeric genomic-cDNA gene, the human NK-3 receptor was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes where it mediates membrane conductance changes in response to its agonist, neurokinin B. More significantly, expression of the gene in mammalian cells resulted in detection of receptor binding as well as neurokinin-stimulated calcium mobilization and arachidonic acid release, all displaying the pharmacological characteristics expected of a neurokinin-3 receptor.

Results demonstrated that both neurons and astrocytes expressed specific RNA for CD137 and its protein, which was found both on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, microglia, which also expressed CD137 mRNA, showed negative immunostaining. CD137-L-specific RNA was detected only in astrocytes and neurons. When brain cells were treated with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), upregulation of CD137 but not of its ligand was observed in neurons and astrocytes. Protein localization was also affected. In microglia, an inhibition of RNA expression was induced by treatment, whereas CD137-L remained negative. Our data are the first demonstration that human brain cells express a protein found thus far in activated immunocompetent cells and epithelia. Moreover, they suggest not only that CD137 and CD137-L might play a role in interaction among human brain cells, but also that FGF-2 might have an immunoregulatory function in brain, modulating interaction of the central nervous system with peripheral immunocompetent cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have studied two natural anticoagulant pathways in normal and in transplanted human hearts. The first is the thrombomodulin pathway. Our immunocytochemical results show thrombomodulin localized to endothelium in heart biopsy specimens before transplantation. This reactivity persists in the absence of cellular rejection, but the infiltration of immune cells is associated with a lack of endothelial thrombomodulin. The second pathway is composed of antithrombin III (ATIII) bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) molecules on endothelial cells. These ATIII-HSPG complexes bind and inactivate thrombin at the endothelial surface. Our immunocytochemical results show ATIII localized to endothelium in heart biopsy specimens before transplantation. This reactivity is present in the absence of vascular rejection as defined by either angiography or microscopy. The absence of thrombomodulin and ATIII is always associated with fibrin deposition within the microcirculation. Thrombomodulin and ATIII pathways appear to be independent, for cellular rejection often is associated with thrombomodulin-negative ATIII-positive endothelium, and vascular rejection often is associated with thrombomodulin-positive ATIII-negative endothelium. Cytokines from activated macrophages down-regulate endothelial thrombomodulin without generally affecting the ATIII-HSPG pathway. Immunosuppressive therapy depletes cytokine-producing cells that affect thrombomodulin, but there presently is no therapy to protect endothelium in vascular rejection. It is possible that heparin could interact with endothelium and bind ATIII to maintain a state of thromboresistance.',\n",

Neurotensin stimulated the phosphoinositides hydrolysis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and this effect was mimicked by neurotensin(8-13) and by neuromedin N. The stimulation of phosphoinositides hydrolysis was not inhibited by pertussis toxin.

To investigate whether PACAP alters chief cell function, we prepared isolated chief cells (> 90% pure) from guinea pig stomach. PACAP-38, PACAP-27, VIP, and secretin all caused a threefold increase in pepsinogen release. The dose-response curves of PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP were biphasic, whereas with secretin it was not. The first phase comprised 40% of maximal release, and each of the three peptides (PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP) were equipotent (EC50 0.1-0.3 nM). For the second phase, comprising 60% of maximal release, the relative potencies were PACAP-38 > PACAP-27 = VIP. 125I-labeled secretin, 125I-VIP, and 125I-PACAP-27 all demonstrated saturable binding to chief cells. Binding of both 125I-PACAP-27 and 125I-VIP was inhibited completely and with similar potencies by PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP. Secretin had a > 500-fold lower affinity than PACAP-38 for displacing both 125I-PACAP-27 and 125I-VIP. With 125I-secretin, secretin was the most potent, and was 197 times more potent than PACAP-38, which was 6-8 times more potent than both PACAP-27 and VIP. We conclude that both PACAP-38 and PACAP-27 stimulate pepsinogen secretion from dispersed chief cells. In contrast to a number of other tissues, no evidence for a high-affinity receptor that interacted only with PACAP was found.

Although both SSTR1 and SSTR2 bound somatostatin specifically and with high affinity, neither was coupled to adenylyl cyclase, a major cellular effector of somatostatin's actions. Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of a third member of the SSTR family. Human SSTR3 is a protein of 418 amino acids and has 45% and 46% identity with human SSTR1 and SSTR2, respectively. RNA blotting studies showed that SSTR3 mRNA could be readily detected in brain and pancreatic islets. The pharmacological properties of human SSTR3 were characterized by transiently expressing the human SSTR3 gene in COS-1 cells. Membranes from cells expressing human SSTR3 bound the somatostatin agonist [125I]CGP 23996 specifically and with high affinity, with a rank order of potency of somatostatin-28 = CGP 23996 > somatostatin-14 > SMS-201-995. Studies using cells transiently coexpressing the human dopamine D1 receptor and human SSTR3 showed that somatostatin was able to inhibit dopamine-stimulated cAMP formation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that SSTR3 was functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase. These results indicate that the diverse biological effects of somatostatin are mediated by a family of receptor with distinct, but overlapping, tissue distributions, unique pharmacological properties, and potentially different functions.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Somatostatin is a tetradecapeptide that is widely distributed in the body. It acts on multiple organs including brain, pituitary, gut, exocrine and endocrine pancreas, adrenals, thyroid, and kidneys to inhibit release of many hormones and other secretory proteins. In addition, it functions as a neuropeptide affecting the electrical activity of neurons. Somatostatin exerts its biological effects by binding to specific high-affinity receptors, which appear in many cases to be coupled to GTP-binding proteins. Here we report the cloning, functional expression, and tissue distribution of two different somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). SSTR1 and SSTR2 contain 391 and 369 amino acids, respectively, and are members of the superfamily of receptors having seven transmembrane segments. There is 46% identity and 70% similarity between the amino acid sequences of SSTR1 and SSTR2. Stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing SSTR1 or SSTR2 exhibit specific somatostatin binding, with an apparently higher affinity for somatostatin-14 than somatostatin-28, and NH2-terminally extended form of somatostatin-14. RNA blotting studies show that SSTR1 and SSTR2 are expressed at highest levels in jejunum and stomach and in cerebrum and kidney, respectively. A SSTR1 probe hybridized to multiple DNA fragments in EcoRI digests of human and mouse DNA, indicating that SSTR1 and SSTR2 are members of a larger family of somatostatin receptors. Thus, the biological effects of somatostatin are mediated by a family of receptors that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Chemokines displayed on the luminal surface of blood vessels play pivotal roles in inflammatory and homeostatic leukocyte trafficking in vivo. However, the mechanisms underlying the functional regulation of chemokines on the endothelial cell surface remain ill-defined. A promiscuous chemokine receptor, the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), has been implicated in the regulation of chemokine functions. Here we show that DARC is selectively expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in the high endothelial venules (HEV) of unstimulated lymph nodes (LN). To examine the biological significance of DARC expression in HEV, we performed competitive binding experiments with 20 different chemokines. The results showed that DARC selectively bound distinct members of the pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL2, CCL5 and CCL7, but not lymphoid chemokines such as CCL21, CCL19, CXCL12 and CXCL13 that are normally expressed in HEV. CCL2 bound to DARC failed to induce a significant cytosolic [Ca(2+)] elevation in CCR2B-expressing cells, whereas the free form of CCL2 induced a distinct [Ca(2+)] elevation, suggesting that DARC down-regulates activities of pro-inflammatory chemokines upon binding. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding DARC did not induce any obvious changes in the cell number or leukocyte subsets in the peripheral and mesenteric LN. Neither did DARC deficiency significantly affect lymphocyte migration into LN. These results suggest that DARC may be a scavenger for pro-inflammatory chemokines, but not a presenting molecule for lymphoid chemokines at HEV and that it is probably functionally dispensable for lymphocyte trafficking to HEV-bearing lymphoid tissues under physiological conditions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A new ligand for syndecan (a cell surface heparan sulfate-rich proteoglycan) has been discovered. In the solid-phase binding assay utilizing small nitrocellulose discs to immobilize matrix molecules, binding of syndecan to neurite growth-promoting protein, p30/amphoterin, was observed. This binding was strongly dependent on the concentration of amphoterin used to coat the discs, but was saturable with an excess amount of syndecan. The interaction was inhibitable with heparan sulfate and heparin but less effectively with chondroitin sulfate, indicating that heparan sulfate chains of syndecan were involved in the binding. Anti-amphoterin antibodies inhibited the binding partially. Mouse mammary epithelial cells were shown to bind amphoterin directly but not after trypsin treatment or in the presence of heparin and to produce amphoterin in the extracellular space. Both syndecan and amphoterin were found to localize on lateral surfaces of newly adhered mammary epithelial cells. Toward confluency amphoterin amounts decreased. Because amphoterin can be localized to the same sites with syndecan and because of their interaction, amphoterin is a new putative pericellular ligand for syndecan. These interactions may be involved in the regulation of cell behavior.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface proteins that mediate both cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. We and others recently identified cDNAs encoding a novel integrin beta subunit, beta 7, in lymphocytes. We have now detected beta 7 mRNA in mouse TK-1 T lymphoma cells, which are known to express the putative Peyer's patch homing receptor alpha 4 beta P. We used an anti-peptide antiserum and a novel mAb against the beta 7 subunit to show that TK-1 cells express beta 7 as the only subunit associated with alpha 4. We conclude that beta 7 and beta P are identical. We also show that activated peripheral blood T cells express alpha 4 beta 7. We studied the function of alpha 4 beta 7/alpha 4 beta P in TK-1 cells, which do not express very late antigen (VLA)-4 (alpha 4 beta 1). Cells adhered to intact fibronectin and to a fibronectin fragment containing the CS-1 region, but not to a fragment containing the RGD sequence. Adhesion to fibronectin was inhibited by antibodies to alpha 4, suggesting that alpha 4 beta 7 is a fibronectin receptor. We confirmed that alpha 4 beta 7 binds to the CS-1 region of fibronectin using affinity chromatography. TK-1 cell adhesion to the vascular cell adhesion molecule VCAM-1 was also inhibited by antibodies to alpha 4, implying that alpha 4 beta 7 also plays a role in the adherence of lymphocytes to endothelial cells. TK-1 cell binding to fibronectin and VCAM-1 is markedly increased by brief PMA stimulation. We also found that mAbs against alpha 4 and beta 7 induce homotypic clustering of TK-1 cells. Taken together these results suggest that alpha 4 beta 7/alpha 4 beta P recognizes some or all of the same widely distributed ligands recognized by VLA-4 (alpha 4 beta 1) and that the role of alpha 4 beta 7/alpha 4 beta P may not be restricted to lymphocyte homing.\",\n",

Monoclonal antibodies against CD40 mediate a variety of effects on B lymphocytes, including induction of intercellular adhesion, short- and long-term proliferation, differentiation and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins. In addition, germinal centre centrocytes are prevented from undergoing apoptosis by activation through CD40 and receptor for antigen. These data indicate that CD40 could be a receptor for an unknown ligand with important functions in B-cell development and activation. This hypothesis is strengthened by the homology of the extracellular region of the CD40 molecule with a family of cell-surface glycoproteins that includes the receptors for nerve growth factor and tumour necrosis factor.

       "  'Abstract': 'The alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR/LRP) consists of two polypeptides, 515 and 85 kDa, that are noncovalently associated. A 39-kDa polypeptide, termed the receptor-associated protein (RAP), interacts with the 515-kDa subunit after biosynthesis of these molecules and remains associated on the cell surface. This molecule regulates ligand binding of alpha 2MR/LRP (Herz, J., Goldstein, J. L., Strickland, D. K., Ho, Y. K., and Brown, M. S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21232-21238). Titration and binding studies indicate that RAP binds to two equivalent binding sites on alpha 2MR/LRP, with a KD of 14 nM. Heterologous ligand displacement experiments demonstrated that RAP completely inhibits the binding of 125I-activated alpha 2M to human fibroblasts and to the purified alpha 2MR/LRP, with a Ki of 23 and 26 nM, respectively. A direct correlation between the degree of binding of RAP to the receptor and the degree of ligand inhibition was observed, indicating that as the RAP binding sites are saturated, alpha 2MR/LRP loses its ability to bind ligands. Thus, the amount of RAP bound to alpha 2MR/LRP dictates the level of receptor activity. A model is proposed in which alpha 2MR/LRP contains multiple ligand binding sites, each regulated by a separate RAP site.',\n",

The cloned DNA confers high affinity binding sites for platelet-activating factor when transfected into COS-7 cells and has binding and desensitization properties similar to the human leukocyte receptor. Southern analysis using this cDNA indicates that the PAF receptor gene is present as a single copy in the human genome. The deduced protein sequence predicts seven hydrophobic regions for the PAF receptor, characteristic of the rhodopsin gene family, and is 83% identical to the deduced protein sequence of the corresponding guinea pig molecule. A modified human PAF receptor cDNA was constructed by inserting an additional 30 nucleotides after the 5'-ATG, encoding the amino acid sequence MDYKDDDDKEF, which is specifically recognized by a monoclonal antibody. The modified cDNA encodes a functional PAF receptor and is detected by antibody on the membrane of transfected COS-7 cells. The use of this construct supports the structural model for the rhodopsin-like superfamily of receptors which places the NH2-terminal sequence on the extracellular side of the membrane, and should additionally be useful for affinity purification of the receptor protein.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The stem cell factor (SCF) is a polypeptide ligand that is essential for the development of germ cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and melanocyte precursors. It binds to a tyrosine kinase membrane receptor that is encoded by the c-kit proto-oncogene. We have constructed an expression vector that directs the synthesis of the entire extracellular ligand-binding domain of the Kit/SCF receptor. When expressed and amplified in Chinese hamster ovary cells, a secreted 90-kDa glycoprotein could be harvested from the growth medium of the cells in a soluble form. This extracellular portion of the Kit/SCF receptor, denoted Kit-X, was recognized by antibodies specific to the SCF receptor; and when injected into animals, it raised antibodies that were reactive with the complete membrane form of the receptor. Direct binding and covalent cross-linking of radiolabeled SCF showed that Kit-X fully retained high affinity ligand binding and also underwent efficient dimerization in the presence of the ligand. The capacity of Kit-X to act as an antagonist of SCF was assayed on cultured cells that overexpress the receptor. Simultaneous addition of SCF and Kit-X to these cells resulted in a stoichiometric inhibition of SCF binding and a consequent decrease in autophosphorylation of the SCF receptor on tyrosine residues. The inhibition extended to later SCF-mediated responses, including the association of the receptor with phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and coupling to the Raf1 protein kinase. These results indicate that the recombinant ectodomain of the Kit-SCF receptor can be used as a specific antagonist of SCF actions and may enable detailed molecular analysis of ligand-receptor interactions.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The human C1q receptor (C1q-R) is a 65-70-kd, highly acidic, hydrophobic glycoprotein that is expressed on a wide variety of cell surfaces. Although the C1q-R itself appears to bind preferentially to C1q, the region of the ligand to which C1q-R binds is the primary binding site for several other molecules, including fibronectin, laminin, and C1q inhibitor (chondroitin 4-sulfate proteoglycan) as well as the complement C1r2C1s2 tetramer. In order to further characterize the C1q-R molecule with regard to its structure and function, highly purified C1q-R was obtained from Raji cells using DEAE-Sephacel and C1q-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography. Studies performed with 125I-labeled C1q-R demonstrated that whereas the C1q-R molecule binds poorly to a variety of human collagens including types II, III, and V, markedly enhanced binding is observed with type IV collagen and moderately enhanced binding with type I collagen. Amino acid composition studies show that the C1q-R molecule contains approximately 44% hydrophobic and 12.6% hydrophilic residues with a ratio of negatively charged to positively charged residues of about 2:1. Treatment of 125I-labeled C1q-R with endoglycosidase F lowers the apparent molecular size from 70 to 58 kd, whereas endoglycosidase H lowered the size to 64 kd. Treatment with neuraminidase, on the other hand, shifted the size of C1q-R to 60 kd. These results suggest the presence of several highly sialylated complex-type or high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Because purified C1q-R has a blocked amino terminus, amino acid sequences representing internal fragments of the molecule were generated by electroblotting and in situ enzymatic digestion. When these short sequences were searched against the National Biomedical Research Foundation computer data base, a seven-amino-acid sequence, VSWQGQI, showed significant homology (100% and 80% in a five-amino-acid overlap, respectively) with the alpha chains of the human fibronectin (alpha 5 beta 1) and vitronectin (alpha v beta 3) receptors, and to a lesser degree with epidermal growth factor receptor and T cell receptor. A second sequence, ISEDNIR, showed homology with mouse collagen type IV (86% in a six-amino-acid overlap), calmodulin (60% in a seven-amino-acid overlap), and a Leishmania major surface antigen, gp63. These observations seem to predict that C1q-R has pockets of conserved sequences that are similar to those not only present in its ligand(s) but also in other cell surface receptors that may, in part, fulfill similar functions.',\n",

The ligand for ELAM-1 is the sialylated Lewis-x antigen (SLe(x)) structure. The selectin LAM-1 (or LECAM-1) has been described as one of the SLe(x)-presenting glycoproteins involved in neutrophil binding to ELAM-1. Other presenter molecules have not yet been described. Our data demonstrate that the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-like surface molecules on neutrophils--known as the nonspecific cross-reacting antigens (NCAs)--are involved in neutrophil adherence to monolayers of IL-1-beta-activated EC. The NCAs are recognized by CD66 (NCA-160 and NCA-90) and CD67 (NCA-95). Because NCA-95 and NCA-90 have previously been found to be phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) neutrophils (which lack PI-linked surface proteins) were tested as well. PNH neutrophils showed a diminished binding to activated EC. CD66 (on PNH cells still recognizing the transmembrane NCA-160 form) still inhibited the adherence of PNH cells to IL-1-beta-activated EC, but to a limited extent. Soluble CEA(-related) antigens inhibited normal neutrophil adherence as well, whereas neutrophil transmigration was unaffected. Sialidase-treatment as well as CD66 preclearing abolished the inhibitory capacity of the CEA(-related) antigens. The binding of soluble CEA antigens to IL-1-beta-pretreated EC was blocked by anti-ELAM-1. These soluble antigens, as well as the neutrophil NCA-160 and NCA-90, both recognized by CD66 antibodies, presented the SLe(x) determinant. Together, these findings indicate that the CD66 antigens (i.e., NCA-160/NCA-90) function as presenter molecules of the SLe(x) oligosaccharide structures on neutrophils that bind to ELAM-1 on EC.',\n",

These two receptors have 77% amino acid identity and are members of the G protein-coupled superfamily of receptors with seven transmembrane domains. We have expressed these two receptors in mammalian cells and find that in this system both receptors bind IL-8 with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The receptor affinities differ for MGSA, however. IL-8R-A binds MGSA with low affinity (Kd approximately 450 nM); IL-8R-B binds MGSA with high affinity (Kd approximately 2 nM). The transfected cells respond to ligand binding with a transient increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. A Ca2+ response is found for IL-8R-A following the binding of IL-8; no response is found for MGSA. A Ca2+ response for IL-8R-B follows the binding of both ligands. Blot hybridization with oligonucleotide probes specific for the two receptors shows that mRNA for both receptors is present in human neutrophils. Analysis of IL-8 and MGSA binding data on neutrophils as well as Ca2+ response and desensitization data shows that the presence of these two IL-8 receptors on the cell surface can account for the profile of these two ligands on neutrophils.',\n",

To clarify and confirm the function of CD36 (glycoprotein IV) as a TSP receptor, we now describe a transfected cell model using human melanoma cells genetically manipulated by sense or antisense cDNA transfection to express either high or near zero levels of CD36. Surface expression was confirmed by flow cytometry with monoclonal anti-CD36 IgG and quantified by measuring radiolabeled antibody binding. Bowes melanoma cells, which in their wild type did not express CD36 and did not bind radiolabeled TSP, when transfected with the sense construct bound TSP in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with CD36 expression. Conversely, C32 melanoma cells, which in their wild type expressed high levels of CD36 and bound radiolabeled TSP at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, did not express CD36 and did not bind TSP when transfected with an antisense construct. In addition, transfected Bowes cells and wild type C32 cells, unlike wild type Bowes cells, adhered to activated platelets in a TSP-dependent manner. These data, i.e. the gain of function with sense cDNA transfection and loss of function with antisense transfection, strongly support the TSP receptor function of CD36. The distribution of this protein in vascular cells and tissues and observations that it may participate in signal transduction events suggest that TSP-CD36 interactions may play a role in mediating some of the pathophysiological processes associated with TSP.',\n",

Interestingly, the FGFR-4 gene was found to encode only the prototype receptor in a region where both FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 show alternative splicing leading to differences in their ligand binding specificities and to secreted forms of these receptors. Ligands binding to FGFR-4 induced receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of a set of cellular polypeptides, which differed from those phosphorylated in FGFR-1-expressing cells. Specifically, the FGFR-1-expressing cells showed a considerably more extensive tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma than the FGFR-4-expressing cells. Structural and functional specificity within the FGFR family exemplified by FGFR-4 may help to explain how FGFs perform their diverse functions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Two human cDNA clones that encode different interleukin-8 (IL8) receptors have recently been isolated. The interleukin-8 receptor type 1 (IL8R1) binds IL8 only, whereas the interleukin-8 receptor type 2 (IL8R2) (previously designated IL8RA) also binds growth regulated gene (GRO), and neutrophil activating protein-2 (NAP-2) with high affinity. In the process of screening a genomic library with these cDNAs to obtain large clones for use in chromosomal localization studies, we isolated an interleukin-8 receptor pseudogene (IL8RP) that bears greatest similarity to IL8R2. Using Southern hybridization analysis of human x rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs with cDNA probes for IL8R1 and IL8R2 and probes from the IL8RP locus, we assigned the three loci to chromosome 2; fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to metaphase chromosome preparations using genomic clones from each locus refined this localization to chromosome 2, band q35, for all three. By virtue of their chromosomal location, IL8R1 and IL8R2 may be considered candidate genes for several human disorders in which the involved locus has been mapped to distal 2q or that are associated with structural abnormalities of this segment, including van der Woude syndrome and the neoplastic diseases rhabdomyosarcoma and uterine leiomyomata. In addition, because this region of chromosome 2q is homologous to proximal mouse chromosome 1 in the segment containing the Lsh-Ity-Bcg locus involved in mediating host resistance to infection with intracellular pathogens, examination for abnormalities of the murine homologues of the IL8R genes should be considered in mice affected by mutations of this locus.',\n",

We report here the results of expression profile analyses and in vitro investigations that point to an interaction between dysferlin and the Ca2+ and lipid-binding proteins, annexins A1 and A2, and define a role for dysferlin in Ca2+-dependent repair of sarcolemmal injury through a process of vesicle fusion. Expression profiling identified a network of genes that are co-regulated in dysferlinopathic mice. Co-immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy revealed that dysferlin normally associates with both annexins A1 and A2 in a Ca2+ and membrane injury-dependent manner. The distribution of the annexins and the efficiency of sarcolemmal wound-healing are significantly disrupted in dysferlin-deficient muscle. We propose a model of muscle membrane healing mediated by dysferlin that is relevant to both normal and dystrophic muscle and defines the annexins as potential muscular dystrophy genes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The firm arrest of leukocytes to the endothelium during inflammation is known to be mediated by endothelial intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) binding to activated integrins displayed on leukocyte surface. Selectin-ligand interactions, which mediate rolling, are believed to be important for facilitating firm adhesion, either by activating integrins or by facilitating the transition to firm adhesion by making it easier for integrins to bind. Although leukocytes employ two distinct adhesion molecules that mediate different states of adhesion, the fundamental biophysical mechanisms by which two pairs of adhesion molecules facilitate cell adhesion is not well understood. In this work, we attempt to understand the interaction between two molecular systems using a cell-free system in which polystyrene microspheres functionalized with the selectin ligand, sialyl Lewis(X) (sLe(X)), and an antibody against ICAM-1, aICAM-1, are perfused over P-selectin/ICAM-1 coated surfaces in a parallel plate flow chamber. Separately, sLe(X)/P-selectin interactions support rolling and aICAM-1/ICAM-1 interactions mediate firm adhesion. Our results show that sLe(X)/aICAM-1 microspheres will firmly adhere to P-selectin/ICAM-1 coated surfaces, and that the extent of firm adhesion of microspheres is dependent on wall shear stress within the flow chamber, sLe(X)/aICAM-1 microsphere site density, and P-selectin/ICAM-1 surface density ratio. We show that P-selectin's interaction with sLe(X) mechanistically facilitates firm adhesion mediated by antibody binding to ICAM-1: the extent of firm adhesion for the same concentration of aICAM-1/ICAM-1 interaction is greater when sLe(X)/P-selectin interactions are present. aICAM-1/ICAM-1 interactions also stabilize rolling by increasing pause times and decreasing average rolling velocities. Although aICAM-1 is a surrogate for beta(2)-integrin, the kinetics of association between aICAM-1 and ICAM-1 is within a factor of 1.5 of activated integrin binding ICAM-1, suggesting the findings from this model system may be insightful to the mechanism of leukocyte firm adhesion. In particular, these experimental results show how two molecule systems can interact to produce an effect not achievable by either system alone, a fundamental mechanism that may pervade leukocyte adhesion biology.\",\n",

Simultaneous T-cell receptor activation and engagement of Letal stimulated proliferation of CD8(+) cells and dramatically increased IL-2 and IFNgamma secretion.

Molecular modeling studies of the extracellular domain of RET (RETECD) have revealed the existence of four cadherin-like domains (CLD1-4) followed by a cysteine-rich domain. Cross-linking experiments have indicated that the RETECD makes direct contacts with both the GDNF ligand and GFR alpha 1 molecule in the complex, although it has low or no detectable affinity for either component alone. We have exploited sequence and functional divergences between the ectodomains of mammalian and amphibian RET molecules to map binding determinants in the human RETECD responsible for its interaction with the GDNF-GFR alpha 1 complex by homologue-scanning mutagenesis. We found that Xenopus RETECD was unable to bind to GDNF-GFR alpha-1 or neurturin (NTN)-GFR alpha-2 complexes of mammalian origin. However, a chimeric molecule containing CLD1, -2, and -3 from human RETECD, but neither domain alone, had similar binding activity as compared with wild type human RETECD, suggesting the existence of an extended ligand binding surface within the three N-terminal cadherin-like domains of human RETECD. Subsequent loss-of-function experiments at higher resolution identified three small subsets of residues, mapping on the same face of the molecular model of RET CLD1, that were required for the interaction of human RETECD with the GDNF-GFR alpha 1 complex. Additional experiments demonstrated that N-linked glycosylation of human RETECD was not required for ligand binding. Based on these observations, we propose a model for the assembly and architecture of the GDNF-GFR alpha 1-RET complex.',\n",

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a family of growth regulatory molecules consisting of PDGF-A and -B, along with the newly discovered PDGF-C and -D. They signal through cell membrane receptors, PDGF receptor alpha (PDGF-Ralpha) and receptor beta (PDGF-Rbeta). Involvement of PDGF-B and PDGF-Rbeta in the initiation and progression of renal fibrosis has been well documented. The authors studied the localization of PDGF ligands and receptors by immunohistochemistry, with emphasis on the role of PDGF-D in murine renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In mice with UUO, de novo expression of PDGF-D was detected in interstitial cells at day 4, which increased to maximal expression at day 14. Increased expression of PDGF-B by interstitial cells and in some tubules was observed after day 4. The diseased mice did not show augmentation of PDGF-A or PDGF-C proteins in the areas of fibrosis. PDGF-Ralpha and -Rbeta protein expression was increased in interstitial cells after day 4 and reached maximal expression at day 14. Human renal nephrectomies (n = 10) of chronic obstructive nephropathy demonstrated similar de novo expression of PDGF-D in interstitial cells, correlating with expression of PDGF-Rbeta and PDGF-B, as it did in the murine model. These observations suggest that PDGF-D plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial injury through binding of PDGF-Rbeta in both human obstructive nephropathy and the corresponding murine model of UUO.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We have recently identified the insulin-like peptide relaxin-3 (aka INSL7) as the endogenous ligand for an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, GPCR135 (aka somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor). Analysis of possible receptors related to GPCR135 revealed a single orphan receptor, GPCR142. Thus, we tested whether GPCR142 could also respond to relaxin-3 or related insulin-like molecules. Surprisingly, GPCR142 was activated by nanomolar concentrations of relaxin-3 but was completely unresponsive to all other known insulin-like peptides. We evaluated by reverse transcriptase-PCR the expression of GPCR142 mRNA in a variety of human tissues and found expression in brain, kidney, testis, thymus, placenta, prostate, salivary gland, thyroid, and colon. In an analysis of other species, we were able to find a full-length mouse homolog of GPCR142, but were unable to detect any complete GPCR142 transcripts in rat. With respect to intracellular signaling, GPCR142 is similar to GPCR135 in that it potently inhibits adenylate cyclase and stimulates 35S-GTPgammaS incorporation in response to relaxin-3. However, whereas GPCR135 signaling could be converted to calcium mobilization using a Gqi5 or Galpha16 G-proteins, GPCR142 was only capable of functioning in the presence of Galpha16. In the accompanying article (Liu, C., Eriste, E., Sutton, S., Chen, J., Roland, B., Kuei, C., Farmer, N., JÃ¶rnvall, H., Sillard, R., and Lovenberg, T. W. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 50754-50764), we present the case that relaxin-3, which has previously been shown to bind to the relaxin receptor LGR7, is most likely the endogenous ligand for GPCR135. In this report, we show an additional receptor, GPCR142, which is also selectively activated by relaxin-3. However, the anatomical localization of GPCR142 suggests that GPCR142 may have different physiological functions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"GPCR135, publicly known as somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor, is expressed in the central nervous system and its cognate ligand(s) has not been identified. We have found that both rat and porcine brain extracts stimulated 35S-labeled guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) incorporation in cells over-expressing GPCR135. Multiple rounds of extraction, purification, followed by N-terminal sequence analysis of the ligand from porcine brain revealed that the ligand is a product of the recently identified gene, relaxin-3 (aka insulin-7 or INSL7). Recombinant human relaxin-3 potently stimulates GTPgammaS binding and inhibits cAMP accumulation in GPCR135 overexpressing cells with EC50 values of 0.25 and 0.35 nM, respectively. 125I-Relaxin-3 binds GPCR135 at high affinity with a Kd value of 0.31 nM. Relaxin-3 is the only member of the insulin/relaxin superfamily that can activate GPCR135. In situ hybridization showed that relaxin-3 mRNA is predominantly expressed in the dorsomedial ventral tegmental nucleus of the brainstem (aka nucleus incertus), as well as in discrete cells in the lateral periaqueductal gray and in the central gray nucleus. GPCR135 is expressed abundantly in the hypothalamus with discrete expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and supraoptic nucleus, as well as in the cortex, septal nucleus, and preoptical area. Relaxin-3 has previously been shown to bind and activate the LGR7 relaxin receptor. However, we believe that neuroanatomical colocalization of GPCR135 and relaxin-3, coupled with a clear high affinity interaction, suggest that GPCR135 is the receptor for relaxin-3. The identification of relaxin-3 as the ligand for GPCR135 provides the framework for the discovery of a new brainstem/hypothalamus circuitry.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neuroligins, proteins of the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family, are found as postsynaptic transmembrane proteins whose extracellular domain associates with presynaptic partners, proteins of the neurexin family. To characterize the molecular basis of neuroligin interaction with neurexin-beta, we expressed five soluble and exportable forms of neuroligin-1 from recombinant DNA sources, by truncating the protein before the transmembrane span near its carboxyl terminus. The extracellular domain of functional neuroligin-1 associates as a dimer when analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium. By surface plasmon resonance, we established that soluble neuroligins-1 bind neurexin-1beta, but the homologous alpha/beta-hydrolase fold protein, acetylcholinesterase, failed to associate with the neurexins. Neuroligin-1 has a unique N-linked glycosylation pattern in the neuroligin family, and glycosylation and its processing modify neuroligin activity. Incomplete processing of the protein and enzymatic removal of the oligosaccharides chain or the terminal sialic acids from neuroligin-1 enhance its activity, whereas deglycosylation of neurexin-1beta did not alter its association capacity. In particular, the N-linked glycosylation at position 303 appears to be a major determinant in modifying the association with neurexin-1beta. We show here that glycosylation processing of neuroligin, in addition to mRNA splicing and gene selection, contributes to the specificity of the neurexin-beta/neuroligin-1 association.',\n",

By CD spectroscopy, Syn2(ect) was found to adopt an all-beta secondary structure. The dissociation constant of Syn2(ect)(+HS) with respect to interleukin-8 binding was determined by isothermal fluorescence titrations to be 23 nM. Despite its lack of HS chains, Syn2(ect)(-HS) exhibited significant binding to the chemokine, with a K (d) of >1 microM.

Full-length GPR100 was amplified from a cDNA library of the neuroendocrine cell line BON, which is derived from a human pancreas carcinoid. The open-reading frame, present on a single exon, coded for a protein of 374 amino acids with highest sequence identity (43%) to the human orphan somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor. The analysis of chromosomal localisation mapped the GPR100 gene to chromosome 1q21.2-q21.3. The stable expression of GPR100 in Chinese hamster ovary cells together with aequorin as calcium sensor and the promiscuous G-protein subunit alpha16 as signal transducer revealed bradykinin and kallidin as effectors to elicit a calcium response. Dose-response curves yielded EC50 values for both ligands in the low nanomolar range, while the respective analogues without arginine at the carboxy-terminus were inactive. Calcium mobilisation was inhibited by the phospholipase C blocker U73122, but not by pertussis toxin, suggesting the involvement of the G-protein subunit alphaq and not alphai or alphao in signal transduction. In line with the main function of kinins as peripheral hormones, we found that GPR100 was expressed predominantly in tissues like pancreas, heart, skeletal muscle, salivary gland, bladder, kidney, liver, placenta, stomach, jejunum, thyroid gland, ovary, and bone marrow, but smaller amounts were also detected in the brain and in cell lines derived from tumours of various origins.',\n",

ChemR23 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor related to chemokine receptors, which is expressed specifically in these cell types. Here we present the characterization of chemerin, a novel chemoattractant protein, which acts through ChemR23 and is abundant in a diverse set of human inflammatory fluids. Chemerin is secreted as a precursor of low biological activity, which upon proteolytic cleavage of its COOH-terminal domain, is converted into a potent and highly specific agonist of ChemR23, the chemerin receptor. Activation of chemerin receptor results in intracellular calcium release, inhibition of cAMP accumulation, and phosphorylation of p42-p44 MAP kinases, through the Gi class of heterotrimeric G proteins. Chemerin is structurally and evolutionary related to the cathelicidin precursors (antibacterial peptides), cystatins (cysteine protease inhibitors), and kininogens. Chemerin was shown to promote calcium mobilization and chemotaxis of immature DCs and macrophages in a ChemR23-dependent manner.

While rat and mouse orthologs of UII precursor protein have been reported, only the tentative structures of UII peptides of these animals have been demonstrated, since prepro-UII proteins lack typical processing sites for their mature peptides. In the present study, we isolated a novel peptide, UII-related peptide (URP), from the extract of the rat brain as the sole immunoreactive substance to anti-UII antibody; the amino acid sequence of the peptide was determined as ACFWKYCV. cDNAs encoding rat, mouse, and human precursor proteins for URP were cloned and revealed that the sequences of mouse and human URP peptides are the same as that for rat URP. Prepro-URP gene is expressed in several rat tissues such as those of the thymus, spleen, testis, and spinal cord, although with lower levels than the prepro-UII gene. In the human, the prepro-URP gene is expressed comparably to prepro-UII in several tissues except the spinal cord. URP was found to bind and activate the human or rat UII receptors (GPR14) and showed a hypotensive effect when administered to anesthetized rats. These results suggest that URP is the endogenous and functional ligand for UII receptor in the rat and mouse, and possibly in the human.

The N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain is not involved in ligand binding, whereas the third membrane proximal fibronectin-like domain accounts for more than 90% of the binding energy to IL-6. Here, the key residues of this fibronectin-like domain involved in the interaction with IL-6 are described.

       "  'Abstract': 'Phospholipid lipid transfer protein (PLTP) is ubiquitously expressed in animal tissues and plays multiple roles in lipoprotein metabolism, but the function of peripheral PLTP is still poorly understood. Here we show that one of its possible functions is to transport cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to lipoprotein particles by a process involving PLTP interactions with cellular ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). When ABCA1 was induced in murine macrophages or ABCA1-transfected baby hamster kidney cells, PLTP gained the ability to promote cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from cells. Although PLTP alone had lipid efflux activity, its maximum activity was observed in the presence of high density lipoprotein particles. Pulsechase studies showed that the interaction of PLTP with ABCA1-expressing cells played a role in promoting lipid efflux. Overexpression of ABCA1 dramatically increased binding of both PLTP and apoA-I to common sites on the cell surface. Both PLTP and apoA-I were covalently cross-linked to ABCA1, each protein blocked cross-linking of the other, and both PLTP and apoA-I stabilized ABCA1 protein. These results are consistent with PLTP and apoA-I binding to ABCA1 at the same or closely related sites. Thus, PLTP mimics apolipoproteins in removing cellular lipids by the ABCA1 pathway, except that PLTP acts more as an intermediary in the transfer of cellular lipids to lipoprotein particles.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Axon-derived molecules are temporally and spatially required as positive or negative signals to coordinate oligodendrocyte differentiation. Increasing evidence suggests that, in addition to the inhibitory Jagged1/Notch1 signaling cascade, other pathways act via Notch to mediate oligodendrocyte differentiation. The GPI-linked neural cell recognition molecule F3/contactin is clustered during development at the paranodal region, a vital site for axoglial interaction. Here, we show that F3/contactin acts as a functional ligand of Notch. This trans-extracellular interaction triggers gamma-secretase-dependent nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain. F3/Notch signaling promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and upregulates the myelin-related protein MAG in OLN-93 cells. This can be blocked by dominant negative Notch1, Notch2, and two Deltex1 mutants lacking the RING-H2 finger motif, but not by dominant-negative RBP-J or Hes1 antisense oligonucleotides. Expression of constitutively active Notch1 or Notch2 does not upregulate MAG. Thus, F3/contactin specifically initiates a Notch/Deltex1 signaling pathway that promotes oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'C1 inhibitor (C1INH), a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) family, is an inhibitor of proteases in the complement system, the contact system of kinin generation, and the intrinsic coagulation pathway. It is the most heavily glycosylated plasma protein, containing 13 definitively identified glycosylation sites as well as an additional 7 potential glycosylation sites. C1INH consists of two distinct domains: a serpin domain and an amino-terminal domain. The serpin domain retains all the protease-inhibitory function, while the amino-terminal domain bears most of the glycosylation sites. The present studies test the hypothesis that plasma C1INH bears sialyl Lewis(x)-related moieties and therefore binds to selectin adhesion molecules. We demonstrated that plasma C1INH does express sialyl Lewis(x)-related moieties on its N-glycan as detected using mAb HECA-452 and CSLEX1. The data also show that plasma C1INH can bind to P- and E-selectins by FACS and immunoprecipitation experiments. In a tissue culture model of endothelial-leukocyte adhesion, C1INH showed inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. Significant inhibition (>50%) was achieved at a concentration of 250 micro g/ml or higher. This discovery may suggest that C1INH plays a role in the endothelial-leukocyte interaction during inflammation. It may also provide another example of the multifaceted anti-inflammatory effects of C1INH in various animal models and human diseases.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The soluble extracellular domains of human interleukin-20 (IL-20) receptors I and II (sIL-20R1 and sIL20R2), along with their ligands IL-19 and IL-20, were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells and purified to homogeneity. Formation of the receptor/receptor and ligand/receptor complexes was studied by size exclusion chromatography. Both ligands and soluble receptors were found to be monomeric in solution; homo- or heterodimers are not formed even at elevated concentrations. Under native conditions, both IL-19 and IL-20 form stable ternary 1:1:1 complexes with the sIL-20R1 and sIL20R2 receptors, as well as high-affinity binary complexes with sIL-20R2. Unexpectedly, sIL-20R1 does not bind on its own to either IL-19 or IL-20. Thus, one of the possible consecutive mechanisms of formation of the signaling ternary complex may involve two steps: first, the ligand binds to receptor II, creating a high-affinity binding site for the receptor I, and only then does receptor I complete the complex.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a cysteine-rich, extracellular matrix-associated heparin-binding protein implicated in a variety of fibrotic disorders. CTGF is initially synthesized as a mosaic protein containing four discrete structural modules (CTGF(1-4)) but this is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage yielding isoforms comprising modules 3 and 4 (CTGF(3-4)) or module 4 alone (CTGF(4)). In this study, we show that cultured rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) produce CTGF(1-4) and CTGF(3-4) following treatment with transforming growth factor-beta and that CTGF is a cell adhesion factor for activated HSCs. Low density lipoprotein receptor-associated protein (LRP) is a receptor for CTGF(1-4) or CTGF(3-4), but not CTGF(4), whereas cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are binding sites for all CTGF isoforms. Prior occupancy of LRP with other LRP ligands, receptor associated protein, anti-LRP, or a thrombospondin type I peptide (TEWSACSKTCG) resulted in a 50% decrease in the adhesion of activated HSCs to CTGF(1-4) or CTGF(3-4) whereas there was no effect on CTGF(4)-mediated adhesion. Co-incubation of CTGF with heparin or perturbation of cell surface HSPGs with heparinase or sodium chlorate completely blocked adhesion of activated HSCs to all CTGF isoforms. Freshly isolated HSCs demonstrated only weak binding to CTGF but strong binding to fibronectin. Thus HSC adhesion is at least partially promoted by CTGF through its binding to LRP, a process that is heparin-dependent. CTGF-LRP interactions are likely mediated by module 3 and CTGF-heparin interactions occur principally in module 4, although additional motifs may account for the heparin-dependency of LRP binding. These data show that LRP and HSPGs are utilized by HSCs for binding to CTGF and suggest that these cell surface molecules may be involved in mediating CTGF activity or adhesive signaling during the activation process.',\n",

However, its receptor Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) does not segregate to specific axonal domains. CHO cells cotransfected with Caspr and F3, but not with F3 alone, bound specifically to substrates coated with Nogo-66 peptide and GST-Nogo-66. Binding persisted even after phosphatidylinositol- specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) removal of GPI-linked F3 from the cell surface, suggesting a direct interaction between Nogo-66 and Caspr. Both Nogo-A and Caspr co-immunoprecipitated with Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, and the developmental expression pattern of both paralleled compared with Kv1.1, implicating a transient interaction between Nogo-A-Caspr and K(+) channels at early stages of myelination. In pathological models that display paranodal junctional defects (EAE rats, and Shiverer and CGT(-/-) mice), distances between the paired labeling of K(+) channels were shortened significantly and their localization shifted toward paranodes, while paranodal Nogo-A congregation was markedly reduced. Our results demonstrate that Nogo-A interacts in trans with axonal Caspr at CNS paranodes, an interaction that may have a role in modulating axon-glial junction architecture and possibly K(+)-channel localization during development.',\n",

Netrin-G1 does not bind any of the known netrin receptors and its function is not known. Here we identify human netrin-G1 ligand (NGL-1), a transmembrane protein containing leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) domains that specifically interacts with netrin-G1 through its LRR region. Whereas netrin-G1 is expressed highly in mouse thalamic axons, NGL-1 is most abundant in the striatum and the cerebral cortex--the intermediate and final targets, respectively, of thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Surface-bound NGL-1 stimulates, but soluble NGL-1 disrupts, the growth of embryonic thalamic axons, and in vitro data indicate that NGL-1 activity may be mediated at least partially by netrin-G1. Our findings provide evidence that netrin-G1 functions as an important component of the NGL-1 receptor to promote TCA outgrowth and that membrane-bound netrins can participate in receiving axonal signaling pathways.',\n",

Each sLRP was purified to homogeneity after deglycosylation using a combination of anion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography. Mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing confirmed the identity of each fragment at purified yields of several milligrams per liter. Despite the large number of disulfide linkages and glycosylation sites in each LDL receptor homology region (sLRP), all were shown to be competent for binding to several LRP1 ligands. Each sLRP also bound human RAP, which is thought to be a generalized receptor antagonist, in solution-binding experiments. As expected, sLRP2 bound the receptor-binding domain of alpha(2)-macroglobulin (residues 1304-1451). All three sLRPs bound human apolipoprotein-enriched beta very low density lipoprotein, the canonical ligand for this receptor. All three sLRPs also bound lactoferrin and thrombin-protease nexin 1 complexes. Only sLRP4 bound thrombin-antithrombin III complexes. The results show that binding-competent LDL receptor homology regions (sLRPs) can be produced in high yield in P. pastoris and readily purified. Each sLRP has binding sites for multiple ligands, but not all ligand binding could be competed by RAP.',\n",

Recently, using ICOS-deficient mice, we have examined the roles of ICOS in immune responses. ICOS is required for humoral immunity. In organ-specific autoimmune responses, however, ICOS has contrast roles in different disease models. On the one hand, ICOS-/- mice exhibited extreme sensitivity to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); on the other, ICOS gene deletion led to complete resistance to collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. Our work not only illustrates the complexity of immune regulation by costimulatory molecules, but also suggests novel therapeutic strategies for various autoimmune diseases.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We identified two novel isoforms of the human chemokine receptor CX3CR1, produced by alternative splicing and with N-terminal regions extended by 7 and 32 aa. Expression of the messengers coding these isoforms, compared with that of previously described V28 messengers, is lower in monocytes and NK cells, but higher in CD4(+) T lymphocytes. CX3CR1 and its extended isoforms were expressed in HEK-293 cells and compared for expression, ligand binding, and cellular responses. In steady state experiments, all three CX3CR1 isoforms bound CX3CL1 with similar affinity. In kinetic binding studies, however, k(on) and k(off) were significantly greater for the extended CX3CR1 isoforms, thereby suggesting that the N-terminal extensions may alter the functions induced by CX3CL1. In signaling studies, all three CX3CR1 isoforms mediated agonist-dependent calcium mobilization, but the EC(50) was lower for the extended than for the standard isoforms. In addition, chemotactic responses for these extended isoforms shifted left, also indicating a more sensitive response. Finally, the longer variants appeared to be more potent HIV coreceptors when tested in fusion and infection assays. In conclusion, we identified and characterized functionally two novel isoforms of CX3CR1 that respond more sensitively to CX3CL1 and HIV viral envelopes. These data reveal new complexity in CX3CR1 cell activation and confirm the critical role of the N-terminal domain of the chemokine receptors in ligand recognition and cellular response.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The NC1 domains of human type IV collagen, in particular alpha3NC1, are inhibitors of angiogenesis and tumor growth (Petitclerc, E., Boutaud, A., Prestayko, A., Xu, J., Sado, Y., Ninomiya, Y., Sarras, M. P., Jr., Hudson, B. G., and Brooks, P. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 8051-8061). The recombinant alpha3NC1 domain contained a RGD site as part of a short collagenous sequence at the N terminus, designated herein as RGD-alpha3NC1. Others, using synthetic peptides, have concluded that this RGD site is nonfunctional in cell adhesion, and therefore, the anti-angiogenic activity is attributed exclusively to alpha(v)beta(3) integrin interactions with non-RGD motifs of the RGD-alpha3NC1 domain (Maeshima, Y., Colorado, P. C., and Kalluri, R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 23745-23750). This nonfunctionality is surprising given that RGD is a binding site for alpha(v)beta(3) integrin in several proteins. In the present study, we used the alpha3NC1 domain with or without the RGD site, expressed in HEK 293 cells for native conformation, as an alternative approach to synthetic peptides to assess the functionality of the RGD site and non-RGD motifs. Our results demonstrate a predominant role of the RGD site for endothelial adhesion and for binding of alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(v)beta(5) integrins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the two non-RGD peptides, previously identified as the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-binding sites of the alpha3NC1 domain, are 10-fold less potent in competing for integrin binding than the native protein, indicating the importance of additional structural and/or conformational features of the alpha3NC1 domain for integrin binding. Therefore, the RGD site, in addition to non-RGD motifs, may contribute to the mechanisms of endothelial cell adhesion in the human vasculature and the anti-angiogenic activity of the RGD-alpha3NC1 domain.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), adrenomedullin (ADM), and amylin belong to a unique group of peptide hormones important for homeostasis in diverse tissues. Calcitonin is essential for calcium balance, whereas CGRP and ADM are important for neurotransmission and cardiovascular and respiratory regulation. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we identified intermedin as a novel member of the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family. Analysis of intermedin expression indicated that intermedin is expressed primarily in the pituitary and gastrointestinal tract. Intermedin increased cAMP production in SK-N-MC and L6 cells expressing endogenous CGRP receptors and competed with labeled CGRP for binding to its receptors in these cells. In addition, treatment of 293T cells expressing recombinant calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and one of the three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) showed that a CRLR/RAMP receptor complex is required for intermedin signaling. In contrast to CGRP and ADM, which exhibited a preferential stimulation of CRLR when co-expressed with RAMP1 and RAMP2 or RAMP3, respectively, intermedin represents a nonselective agonist for the RAMP coreceptors. In vivo studies demonstrated that intermedin treatment led to blood pressure reduction in both normal and spontaneously hypertensive rats via interactions with the CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes. Furthermore, in vivo treatment in mice with intermedin led to suppression of gastric emptying activity and food intake. Thus, identification of intermedin as a novel member of the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family capable of signaling through CRLR/RAMP receptor complexes provides an additional player in the regulation of peripheral tissues by CRLR and will allow development of new therapeutic agents for pathologies associated with diverse vascular and gastrointestinal disorders.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'CXCL16, a recently discovered transmembrane chemokine, is expressed in human aortic smooth muscle cell (ASMC). It facilitates uptake of low density lipoproteins by macrophages, resulting in foam cell formation. However, it is not known whether ASMC express CXCR6, the receptor for CXCL16, or whether CXCL16 affects ASMC biology. To dissect the biological and signal transduction pathways elicited by CXCL16, human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were treated with pharmacological inhibitors or transiently transfected with pathway-specific dominant-negative or kinase-dead expression vectors prior to the addition of CXCL16. HASMC expressed CXCR6 at basal conditions. Exposure of HASMC to CXCL16 increased NF-kappa B DNA binding activity, induced kappa B-driven luciferase activity, and up-regulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression in an NF-kappa B-dependent manner. However, treatment with pertussis toxin (G(i) inhibitor), wortmannin or LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K inhibitors)), or Akt inhibitor or overexpression of dominant-negative (dn) PI3K gamma, dnPDK-1, kinase-dead (kd) Akt, kdIKK-beta, dnIKK-gamma, dnI kappa B-alpha, or dnI kappa B-beta significantly attenuated CXCL16-induced NF-kappa B activation. Furthermore, CXCL16 increased cell-cell adhesion and induced cellular proliferation in an NF-kappa B-dependent manner. In conclusion, CXCL16 is a potent and direct activator of NF-kappaB and induces kappa B-dependent proinflammatory gene transcription. CXCL16-mediated NF-kappa B activation occurred via heterotrimeric G proteins, PI3K, PDK-1, Akt, and I kappa B kinase (IKK). CXCL16 induced I kappa B phosphorylation and degradation. Most importantly, CXCL16 increased cell-cell adhesion and induced kappa B-dependent ASMC proliferation, indicating that CXCL16 may play an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease.',\n",

Whether RANTES uses proteoglycans (PGs) belonging to the syndecan family to attach to primary cells expressing RANTES G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) was investigated.

We show by co-immunoprecipitation experiments that RANTES is associated on these cells with syndecan-1 and syndecan-4, but neither with syndecan-2 nor with betaglycan, in addition to CD44 and its GPCRs, CCR5 and CCR1. Glycosaminidases pre-treatment of the monocyte derived-macrophages strongly decreases the binding of RANTES to syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 and also to CCR5, and abolishes RANTES binding to CD44. This suggests that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are involved in RANTES binding to the PGs and that such bindings facilitate the subsequent interaction of RANTES with CCR5, on the MDM, characterized by low membrane expression of CCR5. The role of these interactions in the pathophysiology of RANTES deserves further study.',\n",

LRP has been shown to act as an endocytosis-mediating receptor for several ligands, including protease-antiprotease complexes and plasma lipoproteins. The former include alpha 2-macroglobulin-protease complexes and plasminogen activator inhibitor-activator complexes. The latter include chylomicron remnant-like particles designated beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) complexed with apoprotein E or lipoprotein lipase. The binding specificity of gp330 is unknown. In the current studies we show that gp330 from rat kidney membranes binds several of these ligands on nitrocellulose blots. We also show that both LRP and gp330 bind an additional ligand, bovine lactoferrin, which is known to inhibit the hepatic clearance of chylomicron remnants. Lactoferrin blocked the LRP-dependent stimulation of cholesteryl ester synthesis in cultured human fibroblasts elicited by apoprotein E-beta-VLDL or lipoprotein lipase-beta-VLDL complexes. Cross-competition experiments in fibroblasts showed that the multiple ligands recognize at least three distinct, but partially overlapping sites on the LRP molecule. Binding of all ligands to LRP and gp330 was inhibited by the 39-kDa protein, which co-purifies with the two receptors, suggesting that the 39-kDa protein is a universal regulator of ligand binding to both receptors. The correlation of the inhibitory effects of lactoferrin in vivo and in vitro support the notion that LRP functions as a chylomicron remnant receptor in liver. LRP and gp330 share a multiplicity of binding sites, and both may function as endocytosis-mediating receptors for a large number of ligands in different organs.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator neuropeptide known to be involved in the regulation of vascular tone. Results of previous studies from our laboratory and others suggest that vascular sensitivity to CGRP is enhanced during pregnancy and that the female sex steroid hormones estradiol-17beta (E2) and progesterone (P4) may be involved in this process. We hypothesized that CGRP receptors in the mesenteric artery are increased during pregnancy and with sex steroid hormone treatments. In the present study, we investigated whether pregnancy and female sex steroid hormones modulate the CGRP-receptors CGRP-A and CGRP-B in the mesenteric artery in the rat. The CGRP-A receptor consists of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1); however, the CGRP-B receptor needs to be further characterized. Messenger RNA levels for CRLR and RAMP1 were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and CGRP-B receptor proteins levels were determined by Western blot analysis. In addition, [125I]CGRP binding was measured by Scatchard analysis. Both mRNA for CGRP-A (CRLR and RAMP1) and the protein for CGRP-B receptors in mesenteric arteries were increased with pregnancy compared to nonpregnant, diestrous animals. A P4 antagonist, RU-486, downregulated and P4 upregulated these receptors in mesenteric arteries (P < 0.05) in pregnant rats. In adult ovariectomized rats, P4 upregulated CRLR and RAMP1 mRNA levels as well as [125I]CGRP-binding sites. The CGRP-B-receptor protein levels were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated by P4 and by combined E2 and P4 treatment. Together with earlier findings, these data suggest that increases in the expression of CGRP-A (CRLR and RAMP1) and CGRP-B receptors in mesenteric arteries may be important in reducing vascular resistance and in vascular adaptations that occur during pregnancy; in addition, P4 may be involved in this process.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) is an oocyte-derived growth factor and a member of the TGF-beta superfamily that includes TGF-beta, activin, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). GDF-9 is indispensable for the development of ovarian follicles from the primary stage, and treatment with GDF-9 enhances the progression of early follicles into small preantral follicles. Similar to other TGF-beta family ligands, GDF-9 likely initiates signaling mediated by type I and type II receptors with serine/threonine kinase activity, followed by the phosphorylation of intracellular transcription factors named Smads. We have shown previously that GDF-9 interacts with the BMP type II receptor (BMPRII) in granulosa cells, but the type I receptor involved is unknown. Using P19 cells, we now report that GDF-9 treatment stimulated the CAGA-luciferase reporter known to be responsive to TGF-beta mediated by the type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)5. In contrast, GDF-9 did not stimulate BMP-responsive reporters. In addition, treatment with GDF-9 induced the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in P19 cells, and the stimulatory effect of GDF-9 on the CAGA-luciferase reporter was blocked by the inhibitory Smad7, but not Smad6. We further reconstructed the GDF-9 signaling pathway using Cos7 cells that are not responsive to GDF-9. After overexpression of ALK5, with or without exogenous Smad3, the Cos7 cells gained GDF-9 responsiveness based on the CAGA-luciferase reporter assay. The roles of ALK5 and downstream pathway genes in mediating GDF-9 actions were further tested in ovarian cells. In cultured rat granulosa cells from early antral follicles, treatment with GDF-9 stimulated the CAGA-luciferase reporter activity and induced the phosphorylation of Smad3. Furthermore, transfection with small interfering RNA for ALK5 or overexpression of the inhibitory Smad7 resulted in dose-dependent suppression of GDF-9 actions. In conclusion, although GDF-9 binds to the BMP-activated type II receptor, its downstream actions are mediated by the type I receptor, ALK5, and the Smad2 and Smad3 proteins. Because ALK5 is a known receptor for TGF-beta, diverse members of the TGF-beta family of ligands appear to interact with a limited number of receptors in a combinatorial manner to activate two downstream Smad pathways.',\n",

Specific binding of [(3)H]SB-674042 was saturable in both whole cell and membrane formats. Analyses suggested a single high-affinity site, with K(d) values of 3.76+/-0.45 and 5.03+/-0.31 nm, and corresponding B(max) values of 30.8+/-1.8 and 34.4+/-2.0 pmol mg protein(-1), in whole cell and membrane formats, respectively. Kinetic studies yielded similar K(d) values. 3. Competition studies in whole cells revealed that the native orexin peptides display a low affinity for the OX(1) receptor, with orexin-A displaying a approximately five-fold higher affinity than orexin-B (K(i) values of 318+/-158 and 1516+/-597 nm, respectively). 4.

Calcium mobilisation studies showed that SB-334867, SB-408124 and SB-410220 are all functional antagonists of the OX(1) receptor, with potencies in line with their affinities, as measured in the radioligand binding assays, and with approximately 50-fold selectivity over the orexin-2 receptor. 6. These studies indicate that [(3)H]SB-674042 is a specific, high-affinity radioligand for the OX(1) receptor. The availability of this radioligand will be a valuable tool with which to investigate the physiological functions of OX(1) receptors.',\n",

A monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been isolated that competes with TM for binding to thrombin. Complete binding kinetic and thermodynamic profiles for these two protein-protein interactions have been generated. Binding kinetics were measured by Biacore. Although both interactions have similar K(D)s, TM binding is rapid and reversible while binding of the mAb is slow and nearly irreversible. The enthalpic contribution to the DeltaG(bind) was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry and van't Hoff analysis. The contribution to the DeltaG(bind) from electrostatic steering was assessed from the dependence of the k(a) on ionic strength. Release of solvent H(2)O molecules from the interface was assessed by monitoring the decrease in amide solvent accessibility at the interface upon protein-protein binding. The mAb binding is enthalpy driven and has a slow k(d). TM binding appears to be entropy driven and has a fast k(a). The favorable entropy of the thrombin-TM interaction seems to be derived from electrostatic steering and a contribution from solvent release. The two interactions have remarkably different thermodynamic driving forces for competing reactions. The possibility that optimization of binding kinetics for a particular function may be reflected in different thermodynamic driving forces is discussed.\",\n",

Ephrin-A1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ligand that binds to the EphA receptor tyrosine kinases. In the present study, we have identified a new ephrin-A1 isoform, denoted ephrin-A1b (ephrin-A1 isoform b). Compared with the originally described ephrin-A1 sequence, ephrin-A1a [Holzman, Marks and Dixit (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 5830-5838], ephrin-A1b lacks a segment of 22 amino acids (residues 131-152). At the transcript level, exon 3 is spliced out in the transcript encoding ephrin-A1b. Transfection of HEK-293T cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) with an ephrin-A1b-expressing plasmid resulted in a significant expression of the protein on the cell surface. However, soluble EphA2 receptor (EphA2-Fc) bound weakly to ephrin-A1b-expressing transfectants, but bound strongly to ephrin-A1a-expressing transfectants. Ephrins have been shown to undergo regulated cleavage after interaction with their receptors. This process is inhibited by co-expression of ephrin-A1a and ephrin-A1b, indicating that ephrin-A1b influences the cleavage process. Taken together, these findings indicate that this newly described isoform may regulate the function of its ephrin-A1a counterpart.',\n",

Recently, we demonstrated that DcR3 is able to modulate the differentiation and activation of dendritic cells (DCs), and that DcR3-treated DCs skew naive T cell differentiation towards a Th2 phenotype. In this study, we further demonstrate that DcR3 is able to induce actin reorganization and enhance the adhesion of monocytes and THP-1 cells by activating multiple signaling molecules, such as protein kinase C (PKC), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src kinases. This provides the first evidence that the soluble DcR3, like other immobilized members of TNFR superfamily, is able to trigger 'reverse signaling' to modulate cell function.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We examined the function of alpha4beta1 integrin in angiogenesis and in mediating endothelial cell responses to the angiogenesis modulators, thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2. Alpha4beta1 supports adhesion of venous endothelial cells but not of microvascular endothelial cells on immobilized thrombospondin-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, or recombinant N-terminal regions of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2. Chemotactic activities of this region of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 are also mediated by alpha4beta1, whereas antagonism of fibroblast growth factor-2-stimulated chemotaxis is not mediated by this region. Immobilized N-terminal regions of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 promote endothelial cell survival and proliferation in an alpha4beta1-dependent manner. Soluble alpha4beta1 antagonists inhibit angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane and neovascularization of mouse muscle explants. The latter inhibition is thrombospondin-1-dependent and not observed in explants from thrombospondin-1-/- mice. Antagonizing alpha4beta1 may in part block proangiogenic activities of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2, because N-terminal regions of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 containing the alpha4beta1 binding sequence stimulate angiogenesis in vivo. Therefore, alpha4beta1 is an important endothelial cell receptor for mediating motility and proliferative responses to thrombospondins and for modulation of angiogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'The C-terminal nonapeptide of mature chemerin activates the chemerin receptor with low nanomolar potency.',\n",
       "  'Abstract': 'Chemerin is a novel protein identified as the natural ligand of ChemR23 (chemerinR), a previously orphan G protein-coupled receptor expressed in immature dendritic cells and macrophages. Chemerin is synthesized as a secreted precursor, prochemerin, which is poorly active, but converted into a full agonist of chemerinR by proteolytic removal of the last six amino acids. In the present work, we have synthesized a number of peptides derived from the C-terminal domain of human prochemerin and have investigated their functional properties as agonists or antagonists of human chemerinR. We found that the nonapeptide (149)YFPGQFAFS(157) (chemerin-9), corresponding to the C terminus of processed chemerin, retained most of the activity of the full-size protein, with regard to agonism toward the chemerinR. Extension of this peptide at its N terminus did not increase the activity, whereas further truncations rapidly resulted in inactive compounds. The C-terminal end of the peptide appeared crucial for its activity, as addition of a single amino acid or removal of two amino acids modified the potency by four orders of magnitude. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified residues Tyr(149), Phe(150), Gly(152), Phe(154), and Phe(156) as the key positions for chemerinR activation. A modified peptide (YHSFFFPGQFAFS) was synthesized and iodinated, and a radioligand binding assay was established. It was found that the ability of the various peptides to activate the chemerin receptor was strictly correlated with their affinity in the binding assay. These results confirm that a precise C-terminal processing is required for the generation of a chemerinR agonist. The possibility to restrict a medium sized protein to a nonapeptide, while keeping a low nanomolar affinity for its receptor is unusual among G protein-coupled receptors ligands. The identification of these short bioactive peptides will considerably accelerate the pharmacological analysis of chemerin-chemerinR interactions.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited vascular dementia characterized by the degeneration of smooth-muscle cells in small cerebral arteries. CADASIL is caused by mutations in NOTCH3, one of the four mammalian homologs to the Drosophila melanogaster NOTCH gene. Disease-associated mutations are distributed throughout the 34 epidermal growth factor-like repeats (EGFRs) that compose the extracellular domain of the Notch3 receptor and result in a loss or a gain of a cysteine residue in one of these EGFRs. In human adults, Notch3 expression is highly restricted to vascular smooth-muscle cells. In patients with CADASIL, there is an abnormal accumulation of Notch3 in the vessel. Molecular pathways linking NOTCH3 mutations to degeneration of vascular smooth-muscle cells are as yet poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of CADASIL mutations on Notch3 activity. We studied five naturally occurring mutations: R90C and C212S, located in the previously identified mutational hotspot EGFR2-5; C428S, shown in this study to be located in the ligand-binding domain EGFR10-11; and C542Y and R1006C, located in EGFR13 and EGFR26, respectively. All five mutant proteins were correctly processed. The C428S and C542Y mutant receptors exhibited a significant reduction in Jagged1-induced transcriptional activity of a RBP/JK responsive luciferase reporter, relative to wild-type Notch3. Impaired signaling activity of these two mutants arose through different mechanisms; the C428S mutant lost its Jagged1-binding ability, whereas C542Y retained it but exhibited an impaired presentation to the cell surface. In contrast, the R90C, C212S, and R1006C mutants retained the ability to bind Jagged1 and were associated with apparently normal levels of signaling activity. We conclude that mutations in Notch3 differently affect Jagged1 binding and Notch3 signaling via the RBP/JK pathway.',\n",

We previously localized the active site within fnD to an eight amino acid sequence unique to tenascin-C, VFDNFVLK, and showed that the amino acids FD and FV are required for activity. The purpose of this study was to identify the neuronal receptor that interacts with VFDNFVLK and to investigate the hypothesis that FD and FV are important for receptor binding. Function-blocking antibodies against both alpha7 and beta1 integrin subunits were found to abolish VFDNFVLK-mediated process extension from cerebellar granule neurons. VFDNFVLK but not its mutant, VSPNGSLK, induced clustering of neuronal beta1 integrin immunoreactivity. This strongly implicates FD and FV as important structural elements for receptor activation. Moreover, biochemical experiments revealed an association of the alpha7beta1 integrin with tenascin-C peptides containing the VFDNFVLK sequence but not with peptides with alterations in FD and/or FV. These findings are the first to provide evidence that the alpha7beta1 integrin mediates a response to tenascin-C and the first to demonstrate a functional role for the alpha7beta1 integrin receptor in CNS neurons.',\n",

Some of these developmental processes entail the activation of cellular signaling cascades. Pharmacological and genetic evidence indicates that the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of L1-type CAMs is at least in part mediated by the stimulation of neuronal receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), especially FGF and EGF receptors. It has long been suspected that neural CAMs might physically interact with RTKs, but their activation by specific cell adhesion events has not been directly demonstrated. Here we report that gain-of-function conditions of the Drosophila L1-type CAM Neuroglian result in profound sensory axon pathfinding defects in the developing Drosophila wing. This phenotype can be suppressed by decreasing the normal gene dosage of the Drosophila EGF receptor gene. Furthermore, in Drosophila S2 cells, cell adhesion mediated by human L1-CAM results in the specific activation of human EGF tyrosine kinase at cell contact sites and EGF receptors engage in a physical interaction with L1-CAM molecules. Thus L1-type CAMs are able to promote the adhesion-dependent activation of EGF receptor signaling in vitro and in vivo.',\n",

In this study, we transfected hCGRP receptors into human embryonic kidney 293 cells and examined their pharmacological profiles using three dominant-negative (DN) RAMP mutants and various hCGRPalpha analogs. Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis revealed that their cotransfection with CTR2 induced cell surface expression of all three RAMPs, and the three CTR2/RAMP heterodimers mediated equivalent levels of cAMP production in response to hCGRPalpha that were approximately 50-fold greater than were seen with CTR2 alone. By contrast, [Tyr0]hCGRPalpha binding and signaling were markedly weaker with CTR2/RAMP2 or -3 than with CTR2/RAMP1 or CRLR/RAMP1; likewise, 125I-[His10]hCGRPalpha bound most potently to CTR2/RAMP1. When CTR2 was coexpressed with DN RAMP1 or -2, hCGRPalpha-evoked responses were similar to those seen with CTR2 alone, despite the expression of both CTR2 and DN RAMP at the cell surface. But coexpression of DN RAMP3 with CTR2 significantly diminished hCGRPalpha signaling compared with that seen with CTR2 alone, indicating that DN RAMP3 is able to function as a negative regulator of CTR2 function. Competition experiments showed the relative agonist sensitivity of the four receptors to be hCGRPalpha > [Tyr0]hCGRPalpha > [Cys(Et)2,7]hCGRPalpha > [Cys(ACM)2,7]hCGRPalpha. Of the linear analogs, [Cys(ACM)2,7]hCGRPalpha (ACM, acetylmethoxy) enhanced cAMP formation only via CTR2/RAMP1, whereas [Cys(Et2,7)]hCGRPalpha acted via CRLR/RAMP1 and somewhat less potently via CTR2/RAMP1. Thus, among the three CGRP8-37-insensitive receptors, CTR2/RAMP1 is most sensitive to the two linear analogs, suggesting that it could be classified as a CGRP2 receptor. Moreover, the combined use of iodinated CGRPalpha analogs may be useful for defining the CGRP1 receptor.',\n",

They are required for both development and maintenance of vertebrates, demonstrating an exquisite pattern of affinities for both protein and proteoglycan receptors. FGF19, one of the most divergent human FGFs, is unique in binding solely to one receptor, FGFR4. We have used molecular replacement to solve the crystal structure of FGF19 at 1.3 A resolution using five superimposed FGF structures as the search model. The structure shows that two novel disulfide bonds found in FGF19, one of which appears to be conserved among several of the other FGFs, stabilize extended loops. The key heparin-binding loops of FGF19 have radically different conformations and charge patterns, compared to other FGFs, correlating with the unusually low affinity of FGF19 for heparin. A model for the complex of FGF19 with FGFR4 demonstrates that unique sequences in both FGF19 and FGFR4 are key to the formation of the complex. The structure therefore offers a clear explanation for the unusual affinity of FGF19 for FGFR4 alone.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The prototypical fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) extracellular domain consists of three Ig domains (D1-D3) of which the two membrane-proximal D2 and D3 domains and the interconnecting D2-D3 linker bear the determinants of ligand binding and specificity. In contrast, D1 and the D1-D2 linker are thought to play autoinhibitory roles in FGFR regulation. Here, we report the crystal structure of the three-Ig form of FGFR3c in complex with FGF1, an FGF that binds promiscuously to each of the seven principal FGFRs. In this structure, D1 and the D1-D2 linker are completely disordered, demonstrating that these regions are dispensable for FGF binding. Real-time binding experiments using surface plasmon resonance show that relative to two-Ig form, the three-Ig form of FGFR3c exhibits lower affinity for both FGF1 and heparin. Importantly, we demonstrate that this autoinhibition is mediated by intramolecular interactions of D1 and the D1-D2 linker with the minimal FGF and heparin-binding D2-D3 region. As in the FGF1-FGFR2c structure, but not the FGF1-FGFR1c structure, the alternatively spliced betaC'-betaE loop is ordered and interacts with FGF1 in the FGF1-FGFR3c structure. However, in contrast to the FGF1-FGFR2c structure in which the betaC'-betaE loop interacts with the beta-trefoil core region of FGF1, in the FGF1-FGFR3c structure, this loop interacts extensively with the N-terminal region of FGF1, underscoring the importance of the FGF1 N terminus in conferring receptor-binding affinity and promiscuity. Importantly, comparison of the three FGF1-FGFR structures shows that the flexibility of the betaC'-betaE loop is a major determinant of ligand-binding specificity and promiscuity.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The MHC class Ib molecule Qa-1 is the primary ligand for mouse CD94/NKG2A inhibitory receptors expressed on NK cells, in addition to presenting Ags to a subpopulation of T cells. CD94/NKG2A receptors specifically recognize Qa-1 bound to the MHC class Ia leader sequence-derived peptide Qdm. Qdm is the dominant peptide loaded onto Qa-1 under physiological conditions and this peptide has an optimal sequence for binding to Qa-1. Peptide dissociation experiments demonstrated that Qdm dissociates from soluble or cell surface Qa-1(b) molecules with a t(1/2) of approximately 1.5 h at 37 degrees C. In comparison, complexes of an optimal peptide (SIINFEKL) bound to the MHC class Ia molecule H-2K(b) dissociated with a t(1/2) in the range from 11 to 31 h. In contrast to K(b), the stability of cell surface Qa-1(b) molecules was independent of bound peptides, and several observations suggested that empty cell surface Qa-1(b) molecules might be unusually stable. Consistent with the rapid dissociation rate of Qdm from Qa-1(b), cells become susceptible to lysis by CD94/NKG2A(+) NK cells under conditions in which new Qa-1(b)/Qdm complexes cannot be continuously generated at the cell surface. These results support the hypothesis that Qa-1 has been selected as a specialized MHC molecule that is unable to form highly stable peptide complexes. We propose that the CD94/NKG2A-Qa-1/Qdm recognition system has evolved as a rapid sensor of the integrity of the MHC class I biosynthesis and Ag presentation pathway.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family (LDLR), LRP5/6, were shown to interact with the Frizzled (Fz) receptors and to function as Wnt coreceptors. Here we show that mLRP4T100, a minireceptor of LRP1, another member of the LDLR family, interacts with the human Fz-1 (HFz1), previously shown to serve as a receptor transmitting the canonical Wnt-3a-induced signaling cascade. However, in contrast to LRP5/6, mLRP4T100, as well as the full-length LRP1, did not cooperate with HFz1 in transmitting the Wnt-3a signaling but rather repressed it. mLRP4T100 inhibitory effect was displayed also by endocytosis-defective mLRP4T100 mutants, suggesting that LRP1 repressive effect is not attributable to LRP1-mediated enhanced HFz1 internalization and subsequent degradation. Enforced expression of mLRP4T100 decreased the capacity of HFz1 cysteine-rich domain (CRD) to interact with LRP6, in contrast to HFz1-CRD/Wnt-3a interaction that was not disrupted by overexpressing mLRP4T100. These data suggest that LRP1, by sequestering HFz1, disrupts the receptor/coreceptor complex formation, leading to the repression of the canonical Wnt signaling. Thus, this study implies that the ability to interact with Fz receptors is shared by several members of the LDLR family. However, whereas some members of the LDLR family, such as LRP5/6, interact with Fz and serve as Wnt coreceptors, others negatively regulate Wnt signaling, presumably by sequestering Fz.',\n",

We mapped the interaction sites between soluble uPAR (suPAR) and high molecular mass kininogen (HK). Binding of biotin-HK to suPAR was inhibited by HK, 56HKa, and 46HKa with an IC50 of 60, 110, and 8 nm, respectively. We identified two suPAR-binding sites, a higher affinity site in the light chain of HK and 46HKa (His477-Gly496) and a lower affinity site within the heavy chain (Cys333-Lys345). HK predominantly bound to suPAR fragments containing domains 2 and 3 (S-D2D3). Binding of HK to domain 1 (S-D1) was also detected, and the addition of S-D1 to S-D2D3 completely inhibited biotin-HK or -46HKa binding to suPAR. Using sequential and overlapping 20-amino acid peptides prepared from suPAR, two regions for HK binding were identified. One on the carboxyl-terminal end of D2 (Leu166-Thr195) blocked HK binding to suPAR and to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). This site overlapped with the urokinase-binding region, and urokinase inhibited the binding of HK to suPAR. A second region on the amino-terminal portion of D3 (Gln215-Asn255) also blocked HK binding to HUVEC. Peptides that blocked HK binding to uPAR also inhibited prekallikrein activation on HUVEC. Therefore, HK interacts with suPAR at several sites. HK binds to uPAR as part of its interaction with its multiprotein receptor complex on HUVEC, and the biological functions that depend upon this binding are modulated by urokinase.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member whose physiological role remains unclear. BCMA has been implicated as a receptor for both a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B cell-activating factor (BAFF), tumor necrosis factor ligands that bind to multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor and have been reported to play a role in autoimmune disease and cancer. The results presented herein provide a dual perspective analysis of BCMA binding to both APRIL and BAFF. First, we characterized the binding affinity of monomeric BCMA for its ligands; BAFF binding affinity (IC50 = 8 +/- 5 microm) is about 1000-fold reduced compared with the high affinity interaction of APRIL (IC50 = 11 +/- 3 nm). Second, shotgun alanine scanning of BCMA was used to map critical residues for either APRIL or BAFF binding. In addition to a previously described \"DXL\" motif (Gordon, N. C., Pan, B., Hymowitz, S. G., Yin, J., Kelley, R. F., Cochran, A. G., Yan, M., Dixit, V. M., Fairbrother, W. J., and Starovasnik, M. A. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 5977-5983), the alanine scanning results predicted four amino acid positions in BCMA (Tyr13, Ile22, Gln25, and Arg27) that could impart ligand specificity. Substitution of Tyr13 was tolerated for BAFF binding but not APRIL binding. Arg27 was required for high affinity binding to APRIL, whereas substitutions of this residue had minimal effect on affinity for BAFF. Further phage display experiments suggested the single mutations of I22K, Q25D, and R27Y as providing the greatest difference in APRIL versus BAFF binding affinity. Incorporation of the Q25D and R27Y substitutions into BCMA produced a dual specificity variant, since it has comparable binding affinity for both APRIL and BAFF, IC50 = 350 and 700 nm, respectively. Binding of the I22K mutant of monomeric BCMA to BAFF was undetectable (IC50 > 100 microm), but affinity for binding to APRIL was similar to wild-type BCMA. Based on these results, a BCMA-Fc fusion with the single I22K mutation was produced that binds APRIL, IC50 = 12 nm, and has no measurable affinity for BAFF. These results suggest that APRIL is the preferred ligand for BCMA and show that specificity can be further modified through amino acid substitutions.',\n",

We demonstrate that the active receptor complex for IL-26 is a heterodimer composed of two receptor proteins: IL-20R1 and IL-10R2. Signaling through the IL-26R results in activation of STAT1 and STAT3 which can be blocked by neutralizing Abs against IL-20R1 or IL-10R2. IL-10R2 is broadly expressed on a wide variety of tissues, whereas only a limited number of tissues express IL-20R1. Therefore, the ability to respond to IL-26 is restricted by the expression of IL-20R1.

However, in reconstituted non-neuronal systems, NgR1 and p75 together are unable to activate RhoA, suggesting that additional components of the receptor may exist. Here we describe LINGO-1, a nervous system-specific transmembrane protein that binds NgR1 and p75 and that is an additional functional component of the NgR1/p75 signaling complex. In non-neuronal cells, coexpression of human NgR1, p75 and LINGO-1 conferred responsiveness to oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein, as measured by RhoA activation. A dominant-negative human LINGO-1 construct attenuated myelin inhibition in transfected primary neuronal cultures. This effect on neurons was mimicked using an exogenously added human LINGO-1-Fc fusion protein. Together these observations suggest that LINGO-1 has an important role in CNS biology.',\n",

Unlike a number of other ADAM proteins, which interact with integrin receptors via their disintegrin domains, there is currently no evidence for an ADAM-17-integrin association. By analyzing the adhesion of a series of cell lines with recombinant fragments of the extracellular domain of ADAM-17, we now demonstrate a functional interaction between ADAM-17 and alpha(5)beta(1) integrin in a trans orientation. Because ADAM-17-mediated adhesion was sensitive to RGD peptides and EDTA, and the integrin-binding site within ADAM-17 was narrowed down to the disintegrin/cysteine-rich region, the two molecules appear to have a ligand-receptor relationship mediated by the alpha(5)beta(1) ligand binding pocket. Intriguingly, ADAM-17 and alpha(5)beta(1) were found to co-localize in both membrane ruffles and focal adhesions in HeLa cells. When confluent HeLa cell monolayers were wounded, ADAM-17 and alpha(5)beta(1) redistributed to the leading edge and co-localized, which is suggestive of a cis orientation. We postulate that the interaction of ADAM-17 with alpha(5)beta(1) may target or modulate its metalloproteolytic activity.',\n",

Here, we demonstrate a critical involvement of Sema6D in cardiac morphogenesis. Ectopic expression of Sema6D o RNA interference against Sema6D induces expansion or narrowing of the ventricular chamber, respectively, during chick embryonic development. Sema6D also exerts region-specific activities on cardiac explants, a migration-promoting activity on outgrowing cells from the conotruncal segment, and a migration-inhibitory activity on those from the ventricle. Plexin-A1 mediates these activities as the major Sema6D-binding receptor. Plexin-A1 forms a receptor complex with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 in the conotruncal segment or with Off-track in the ventricle segment; these complexes are responsible for the effects of Sema6D on the respective regions. Thus, the differential association of Plexin-A1 with additional receptor components entitles Sema6D to exert distinct biological activities at adjacent regions.

       "  'Abstract': 'The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a large (>600 kDa) multi-ligand-binding cell surface receptor that is now known to participate in a diverse range of cellular events. To accomplish this diverse role, LRP is composed of repetitive amino acid motifs consisting of complement-type and EGF precursor-type repeats. Within these repeats are six conserved cysteine residues that form the core disulfide bond structure of each repeat. To accommodate the intricate folding that such a complex structure dictates, a specialized chaperone is present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) called the receptor-associated protein (RAP) that binds to LRP immediately following its biosynthesis and assists in its exocytic transport. Interestingly, RAP -/- mice show reduced LRP expression in certain cell types, but not a more global affect on LRP expression that was expected. Such a tissue-restricted effect by RAP prompted an investigation if other ER chaperones associate with LRP to assist in its complex folding requirements and compensate for the absence of RAP in RAP -/- cells. Fibroblasts obtained from RAP -/- mice demonstrate similar LRP expression levels and subcellular distribution as RAP +/+ fibroblasts. Moreover, RAP -/- cells show an identical exocytic trafficking rate for LRP as RAP +/+ cells and comparable cell surface internalization kinetics. In RAP -/- cells, three well-known ER chaperones, calnexin, calreticulin, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), associate with LRP and likely compensate for the absence of RAP.',\n",

Extracellular alpha-/beta-cleavage of APP generates a large secreted N-terminal fragment, and a smaller cellular C-terminal fragment. Subsequent gamma-secretase cleavage in the transmembrane region of the C-terminal fragment induces secretion of small extracellular peptides, including Abeta40 and Abeta42, which are instrumental in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and intracellular release of a cytoplasmic tail fragment. Although APP resembles a cell-surface receptor, no functionally active extracellular ligand for APP that might regulate its proteolytic processing has been described. We now show that F-spondin, a secreted signaling molecule implicated in neuronal development and repair, binds to the conserved central extracellular domain of APP and inhibits beta-secretase cleavage of APP. Our data indicate that F-spondin may be an endogenous regulator of APP cleavage, and suggest that the extracellular domains of APP are potential drug targets for interfering with beta-secretase cleavage.\",\n",

It acts as a receptor for neurotensin, but predominates in regions of the nervous system that neither synthesize nor respond to this neuropeptide, suggesting that sortilin has additional roles. Sortilin is expressed during embryogenesis in areas where nerve growth factor (NGF) and its precursor, proNGF, have well-characterized effects. These neurotrophins can be released by neuronal tissues, and they regulate neuronal development through cell survival and cell death signalling. NGF regulates cell survival and cell death via binding to two different receptors, TrkA and p75NTR (ref. 10). In contrast, proNGF selectively induces apoptosis through p75NTR but not TrkA. However, not all p75NTR-expressing cells respond to proNGF, suggesting that additional membrane proteins are required for the induction of cell death. Here we report that proNGF creates a signalling complex by simultaneously binding to p75NTR and sortilin.

Here, we examined the activity of a recombinant protein containing amino-terminal residues 1-90 of TSP-1 and found that this domain did not retain high-affinity heparin-binding. The loss of heparin-binding correlated with decreased binding to the fibroblast cell surface. However, both ligand blotting and solid phase binding studies indicate that this truncated fragment of TSP-1 retained high-affinity binding to LRP-1. Consistent with this, it also retained the ability to block the uptake and degradation of (125)I-TSP-1. However, TSP-1(1-90) itself was poorly endocytosed and this truncated amino-terminal domain was considerably more effective than the full-length heparin-binding domain (HBD) of TSP-1 in blocking the catabolism of endogenously expressed TSP-1.

The mature protein sequence was 55% identical to human ICAM-2, with conservation of five out of six residues critical for binding of the human protein to its ligand LFA-1. Northern blot analysis identified ICAM-2 transcripts of 4.0 and 1.4 kb in cultured pig endothelial cells and mRNA was detected in pig lung, spleen, kidney, liver and heart by RT-PCR. The gene structure and endothelial expression of pig ICAM-2 were strikingly similar to those of its human and mouse counterparts. However, unlike human ICAM-2, expression of pig ICAM-2 on cultured endothelial cells was not down-regulated by treatment with the inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. Pig ICAM-2 expressed on stable transfectants supported firm adhesion of cells expressing human LFA-1. This conservation of function across the species barrier suggests that pig ICAM-2 plays a role in the cellular interactions associated with xenograft rejection.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'During blastocyst implantation, interaction between integrins on the apical surface of the trophoblast and extracellular matrix (ECM) in the endometrium anchors the embryo to the uterine wall. Strong adhesion of the blastocyst to fibronectin (FN) requires integrin signaling initiated by exogenous fibronectin. However, it is not known how integrin signaling enhances blastocyst adhesion. We present new evidence that the integrin, alphaIIbbeta3, plays a key role in trophoblast adhesion to fibronectin during mouse peri-implantation development. Trafficking of alphaIIb to the apical surface of the trophoblast increased dramatically after blastocysts were exposed to fibronectin, whereas other fibronectin-binding integrins, alpha5beta1 and alphaVbeta3, were resident at the apical surface before ligand exposure. Functional comparisons among the three integrins revealed that ligation of alpha5beta1 most efficiently strengthened blastocyst fibronectin-binding activity, while subsequent trophoblast cell migration was dependent primarily on the beta3-class integrins. In vivo, alphaIIb was highly expressed by invasive trophoblast cells in the ectoplacental cone and trophoblast giant cells of the parietal yolk sac. These data demonstrate that trafficking of alphaIIb regulates adhesion between trophoblast cells and fibronectin as invasion of the endometrium commences.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The poliovirus receptor (PVR) belongs to a large family of Ig molecules called nectins and nectin-like proteins, which mediate cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, and serve as entry receptors for viruses. It has been recently shown that human NK cells recognize PVR through the receptor DNAM-1, which triggers NK cell stimulation in association with beta(2) integrin. In this study, we show that NK cells recognize PVR through an additional receptor, CD96, or T cell-activated increased late expression (Tactile). CD96 promotes NK cell adhesion to target cells expressing PVR, stimulates cytotoxicity of activated NK cells, and mediates acquisition of PVR from target cells. Thus, NK cells have evolved a dual receptor system that recognizes nectins and nectin-like molecules on target cells and mediates NK cell adhesion and triggering of effector functions. As PVR is highly expressed in certain tumors, this receptor system may be critical for NK cell recognition of tumors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Eotaxin-3 (CCL26), like eotaxin (CCL11) and eotaxin-2 (CCL24), has long been considered a specific agonist for CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3), attracting and activating eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 type T lymphocytes. Although not characterized extensively yet, its expression profile coincides with a potential role in allergic inflammation. We recently reported that eotaxin-3 is an antagonist for CCR2 (Ogilvie, P., Paoletti, S., Clark-Lewis, I., and Uguccioni, M. (2003) Blood 102, 789-784). In the present report, we provide evidence that eotaxin-3 acts as a natural antagonist on CCR1 and -5 as well. Eotaxin-3 bound to cells transfected with either CCR1 or -5 as well as to monocytes expressing both receptors. Further, it inhibited chemotaxis, the release of free intracellular calcium, and actin polymerization when cells were stimulated with known agonists of CCR1 and -5. An analysis of its three-dimensional structure indicated the presence of two distinct epitopes that may be involved in specific binding to CCR1, -2, -3, and -5. Taken together, our data thus indicate eotaxin-3 to be the first human chemokine that features broadband antagonistic activities, suggesting that it may have a modulatory rather than an inflammatory function. Further, eotaxin-3 may play an unrecognized role in the polarization of cellular recruitment by attracting Th2 lymphocytes as well as eosinophils and basophils via CCR3, while concomitantly blocking the recruitment of Th1 lymphocytes and monocytes via CCR1, -2, and -5.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Rhomboid-1 is a serine protease that cleaves the membrane domain of the Drosophila EGF-family protein, Spitz, to release a soluble growth factor. Several vertebrate rhomboid-like proteins have been identified, although their substrates and functions remain unknown. The human rhomboid, RHBDL2, cleaves the membrane domain of Drosophila Spitz when the proteins are co-expressed in mammalian cells. However, the membrane domains of several mammalian EGF-family proteins were not cleaved by RHBDL2, suggesting that the endogenous targets of the human protease are not EGF-related factors. We demonstrate that the amino acid sequence at the luminal face of the membrane domain of a substrate protein determines whether it is cleaved by RHBDL2. Based on this finding, we predicted B-type ephrins as potential RHBDL2 substrates. We found that one of these, ephrinB3, was cleaved so efficiently by the protease that little ephrinB3 was detected on the surface of cells co-expressing RHBDL2. These results raise the possibility that RHBDL2-mediated proteolytic processing may regulate intercellular interactions between ephrinB3 and eph receptors.',\n",

The main chain atoms of Leu 51 and Asp53 of BMP-2 represent a hot spot of binding to BRIA. The BMP-2 variant L51P was deficient in type I receptor binding only, whereas its overall structure and its binding to type II receptors and modulator proteins, such as noggin, were unchanged. Thus, the L51P substitution converts BMP-2 into a receptor-inactive inhibitor of noggin.

       "  'Abstract': 'Cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors of the subtype B (CCK-BR) have been shown to be overexpressed in certain neuroendocrine tumors including medullary thyroid cancer. Our recent work has focused on new methods to radiolabel the CCK8 peptide with 111In or 99mTc for CCK-B receptor imaging. Derivatives of CCK8 were obtained by addition at the N-terminus in solid phase of a DTPA derivative (DTPAGlu) linked through a glycine spacer (DTPAGlu-G-CCK8) or cysteine, glycine and a diphenylphosphinopropionyl moiety (PhosGC-CCK8) for labeling with 111In and 99mTc, respectively. CCK-BR overexpressing A431 cancer cell lines were utilized to characterize in vitro properties of the two compounds as well as for generating xenografts in nude mice for in vivo characterization. Both 111In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8 and 99mTcPhosGC-CCK8 showed similar binding affinities for CCK-BR with dissociation constants of 20-40 nM, were internalized after interaction with the receptor and displayed prolonged cellular retention times. Specific in vivo interaction with the receptor of both CCK8 analogs was observed in our animal model. 111In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8 showed better target to non-target ratios, although it appeared to be rapidly metabolized after injection and activity cleared through the kidneys. 99mTc-PhosGC-CCK8 was more stable in vivo but showed marked hepatobiliary clearance with resulting high background activity in the bowel. The rapid clearance and lower background obtained with 111In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8 make this a better candidate for further development.',\n",

Our previous observations demonstrate that F3/contactin is a functional ligand of Notch during oligodendrocyte maturation, revealing the existence of another group of Notch ligands. Here, we establish that NB-3, a member of the F3/contactin family, acts as a novel Notch ligand to participate in oligodendrocyte generation. NB-3 triggers nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain and promotes oligodendrogliogenesis from progenitor cells and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells via Deltex1. In primary oligodendrocytes, NB-3 increases myelin-associated glycoprotein transcripts. Thus, the NB-3/Notch signaling pathway may prove to be a molecular handle to treat demyelinating diseases.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The glutamine(4) residue in [deamino-Cys(1)]arginine vasopressin (dAVP) was replaced by a broad series of aliphatic, aromatic, polar, and charged amino acids to give the following peptides: d[Gly(4)]AVP (1), d[Ala(4)]AVP (2), d[Abu(4)]AVP (3), d[Nva(4)]AVP (4), d[Nle(4)]AVP (5), d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Ile(4)]AVP (7), d[Thi(4)]AVP (8), d[Phe(4)]AVP (9), d[Tyr(4)]AVP (10), d[Trp(4)]AVP (11), d[Asn(4)]AVP (12), d[Ser(4)]AVP (13), d[Thr(4)]AVP (14), d[Dap(4)]AVP (15), d[Dab(4)]AVP (16), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), d[Har(4)]AVP (20), and d[Glu(4)]AVP (21). All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods using BOC chemistry for all but one peptide (8), which required the use of Fmoc chemistry. The binding and functional properties of these position 4 substituted analogues of dAVP (d[X(4)]AVP) and the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP (Derick et al. Endocrinology 2002, 143, 4655-4664) were evaluated on human arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1a), V(1b), and V(2) receptors and on the human oxytocin (OT) receptor expressed in living Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Binding studies revealed that broad modifications of the fourth residue of dAVP do not significantly alter affinity for the human V(1b) receptor. Only aromatic (Phe, Tyr, Trp) or negatively charged (Glu) residues reduce V(1b) affinity. By contrast, the human V(1a) and more particularly the human V(2) and the OT receptors are more sensitive to many of these modifications. Thus, the replacement of the Gln(4) residue of dAVP by aliphatic (Leu, Cha) or positively charged (Orn, Lys, Arg, Har) amino acids led to analogues exhibiting drastic reductions of their affinity for the human V(1a), V(2), and OT receptors. Consequently, in addition to the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP, peptides 6 and 17-20 display excellent selectivities for the human V(1b) receptor. The key structural requirement responsible for optimal V(1b) selectivity appears to be the length and branching of the aliphatic side chain of the fourth residue of dAVP. Functional studies performed on CHO cells expressing the different human AVP/OT receptors confirm the V(1b) selectivity of peptides 6, 17, 18, 20, and d[Cha(4)]AVP. However, d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), which triggers an excellent coupling between the human V(2) receptor and adenylyl cyclase, was found to exhibit both V(1b) and V(2) agonism in functional tests. More interestingly, these functional experiments revealed that, depending on the AVP/OT receptor, a given d[X(4)]AVP analogue may behave as a full agonist or as a partial agonist. This strongly suggests that the fourth residue of dAVP plays an important role in the coupling between the hormone-receptor complex, the heterotrimeric G protein, and the effectors. In conclusion, the synthesis of these d[X(4)]AVP analogues led to the discovery of new V(1b) agonists with high affinity and greatly enhanced selectivities. Thus, in addition to d[Cha(4)]AVP, d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[Lys(4)]AVP (18), and d[Har(4)]AVP (20) are useful new tools for studying the structure and the function of the human V(1b) receptor.',\n",

In the present study, we demonstrated that glypican-1 can bind fibrillar Abeta, and the binding is mainly mediated by heparan sulfate (HS) chains. Further analysis revealed that glypican-1 is the major HSPG localized in detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched (DIG) domains where all machineries for Abeta production exist and Abeta is accumulated as monomeric and oligomeric forms. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that glypican-1 is localized in primitive plaques as well as classic plaques. Moreover, overexpression of glypican-1 and amyloid precursor protein in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in reduced cell viability and made cells more susceptible to thapsigargin-induced stress and Abeta toxicity. The results raise the possibility that glypican-1 interacts with oligomerized or polymerized Abeta in such a specific compartment as DIG, resulting not only in amyloid deposition in senile plaques of AD brain, but also in accelerating neuronal cell death in response to stress and Abeta.\",\n",

CCN family members contain four characteristic domains and exhibit multiple activities: they associate with the extracellular matrix, they can mediate cell adhesion, cell migration and chemotaxis, and they can modulate the activities of peptide growth factors. Many of the effects of CTGF are thought to be mediated by binding to integrins, whereas others may be because of its recently identified ability to interact with BMP4 and TGF beta. We demonstrate, using Xenopus embryos, that CTGF also regulates signalling through the Wnt pathway, in accord with its ability to bind to the Wnt co-receptor LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). This interaction is likely to occur through the C-terminal (CT) domain of CTGF, which is distinct from the BMP- and TGF beta-interacting domain. Our results define new activities of CTGF and add to the variety of routes through which cells regulate growth factor activity in development, disease and tissue homeostasis.',\n",

Exposure of EphB2-expressing cells to ephrin-A5 leads to receptor clustering, autophosphorylation and initiation of downstream signaling. Ephrin-A5 induces EphB2-mediated growth cone collapse and neurite retraction in a model system. We further show, using X-ray crystallography, that the ephrin-A5-EphB2 complex is a heterodimer and is architecturally distinct from the tetrameric EphB2-ephrin-B2 structure.

Cells expressing TRHR-Timer responded to TRH with an 11-fold increase in inositol phosphate formation, increased intracellular free calcium, and internalization of 75% of bound [(3)H][N(3)-methyl-His(2)]TRH within 10 min. After a 20-min exposure to TRH at 37 C, 75-80% of surface binding sites disappeared as receptors internalized. When TRH was removed and cells incubated in hormone-free medium, approximately 75% of [(3)H][N(3)-methyl-His(2)]TRH binding sites reappeared at the surface over the next 2 h with or without cycloheximide. Trafficking of TRHR-Timer was monitored microscopically after addition and withdrawal of TRH. In untreated cells, both new (green) and old (red) receptors were seen at the plasma membrane, and TRH caused rapid movement of young and old receptors into cytoplasmic vesicles. When TRH was withdrawn, some TRHR-Timer reappeared at the plasma membrane after several hours, but much of the internalized receptor remained intracellular in vesicles that condensed to larger structures in perinuclear regions deeper within the cell. Strikingly, receptors that moved to the plasma membrane were generally younger (more green) than those that underwent endocytosis. There was no change in the red to green ratio over the course of the experiment in cells exposed to vehicle. The results indicate that, after agonist-driven receptor internalization, the plasma membrane is replenished with younger receptors, arising either from an intracellular pool or preferential recycling of younger receptors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are abundant intracellular neutrophil proteinases that have an important role in destroying ingested particles. However, when neutrophils degranulate, these proteinases are released and can cause irreparable damage by degrading host connective tissue proteins. Despite abundant endogenous inhibitors, these proteinases are protected from inhibition because of their ability to bind to anionic surfaces. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), which is not an inhibitor of these proteinases, possesses properties that could make it an effective inhibitor of neutrophil proteinases if its specificity could be redirected. PAI-1 efficiently inhibits surface-sequestered proteinases, and it efficiently mediates rapid cellular clearance of PAI-1-proteinase complexes. Therefore, we examined whether PAI-1 could be engineered to inhibit and clear neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. By introducing specific mutations in the reactive center loop of wild-type PAI-1, we generated PAI-1 mutants that are effective inhibitors of both proteinases. Kinetic analysis shows that the inhibition of neutrophil proteinases by these PAI-1 mutants is not affected by the sequestration of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G onto surfaces. In addition, complexes of these proteinases and PAI-1 mutants are endocytosed and degraded by lung epithelial cells more efficiently than either the neutrophil proteinases alone or in complex with their physiological inhibitors, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor and alpha1-antichymotrypsin. Finally, the PAI-1 mutants were more effective in reducing the neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G activities in an in vivo model of lung inflammation than were their physiological inhibitors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Proliferation, differentiation, and survival of hematopoietic cells are regulated by cytokines, acting through specific receptors. FLT3 ligand (FL) is one of the most important cytokines for regulation of the hematopoietic system, and its receptor FLT3 is expressed on both stem cells and progenitors. Regulation of Forkhead transcription factors has been described as an important mechanism to control apoptosis and cell cycle progression in hematopoietic progenitors. Here we report that FL induces AKT/PKB activation, which in turn phosphorylates and thereby inactivates the Forkhead protein FoxO3 in the progenitor cell line FDC-P1 stably expressing murine FLT3 receptor. Phosphorylation of AKT and FoxO3 was blocked by the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 but not by the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059. Expression of a mutated FoxO3, in which all three inhibitory phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine, led to rapid increase of apoptotic cells in the presence of FL. These results suggest that FL-induced regulation of apoptosis is executed by FoxO3.',\n",

However, the exact functions of many activating surface receptors, as well as their ligands, still remain to be elucidated. NTB-A is a receptor on the surfaces of human NK, T, and B cells, mediating a signal whose malfunction may be involved in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease. However, the ligand of NTB-A has remained elusive so far. Using trimeric recombinant proteins, we now show that NTB-A is its own ligand. Homophilic interaction of NTB-A enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and influences NK cell proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion.

The accumulation of the enzyme in the synaptic basal lamina strictly relies on ColQ. This has been shown to be mediated by interaction between ColQ and perlecan, which itself binds dystroglycan. Here, using transfected mutants of ColQ in a ColQ-deficient muscle cell line or COS-7 cells, we report that ColQ clusterizes through a more complex mechanism. This process requires two heparin-binding sites contained in the collagen domain as well as the COOH terminus of ColQ. Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments in Torpedo postsynaptic membranes together with transfection experiments with muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) constructs in MuSK-deficient myotubes or COS-7 cells provide the first evidence that ColQ binds MuSK. Together, our data suggest that a ternary complex containing ColQ, perlecan, and MuSK is required for AChE clustering and support the notion that MuSK dictates AChE synaptic localization at the neuromuscular junction.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Human sensory neuron-specific G-protein-coupled receptors (SNSRs) are expressed solely in small diameter primary sensory neurons. This restricted expression pattern is of considerable therapeutic interest because small nociceptors transmit chronic pain messages. The neuronal function of human SNSRs is difficult to assess because rodent orthologs have yet to be clearly defined, and individual isoforms are found only in a small subset of primary sensory neurons. To circumvent this problem, we expressed human SNSR4 (hSNSR4; also known as Hs.mrgX1) in rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG), dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and hippocampal neurons using nuclear injection or recombinant adenoviruses and examined modulation of ion channels and neurotransmission using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. BAM8-22 (a 15 amino acid C-terminal fragment of bovine adrenal medulla peptide 22), a peptide agonist derived from proenkephalin, inhibited high (but not low) voltage-activated Ca2+ current in both DRG and SCG neurons expressing hSNSR4, whereas no response was detected in control neurons. The Ca2+ current inhibition was concentration dependent and partially sensitive to Pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment. Additionally, the peptide was highly effective in modulating current arising from M-type K+ channels in SCG neurons expressing hSNSR4. In hippocampal neurons expressing hSNSR4, BAM8-22 induced presynaptic inhibition of transmission that was abolished after PTX treatment. Our data indicate that hSNSR4, when heterologously expressed in rat neurons, can be activated by an opioid-related peptide, couples to G(q/11)-proteins as well as PTX-sensitive G(i/o)-proteins, and modulates neuronal Ca2+ channels, K+ channels, and synaptic transmission.',\n",

HGF-dependent signaling requires proteolysis from an inactive single-chain precursor into an active alpha/beta-heterodimer. We show that the serine protease-like HGF beta-chain alone binds Met, and report its crystal structure in complex with the Sema and PSI domain of the Met receptor. The Met Sema domain folds into a seven-bladed beta-propeller, where the bottom face of blades 2 and 3 binds to the HGF beta-chain 'active site region'. Mutation of HGF residues in the area that constitutes the active site region in related serine proteases significantly impairs HGF beta binding to Met. Key binding loops in this interface undergo conformational rearrangements upon maturation and explain the necessity of proteolytic cleavage for proper HGF signaling. A crystallographic dimer interface between two HGF beta-chains brings two HGF beta:Met complexes together, suggesting a possible mechanism of Met receptor dimerization and activation by HGF.\",\n",

Originally isolated from porcine spinal cord, it has since been isolated and sequenced from several species. Amino acid alignment of NmU from different species reveals a high level of conservation, and particular features within its structure are important for bioactivity. Specifically, the C terminus, including a terminal asparagine-linked amidation, is essential for activity. The conservation of NmU across a wide range of species indicates a strong evolutionary pressure to conserve this peptide and points to its physiological significance. Despite this, the precise physiological and indeed pathophysiological roles of NmU have remained elusive. NmU was first isolated based on its ability to contract rat uterine smooth-muscle (hence the suffix \"U\") and has since been implicated in the regulation of smooth-muscle contraction, blood pressure and local blood flow, ion transport in the gut, stress responses, cancer, gastric acid secretion, pronociception, and feeding behavior. Two G-protein-coupled receptors for NmU have recently been cloned. These receptors are widespread throughout the body but have differential distributions suggesting diverse but specific roles for the receptor subtypes. Here we detail the isolation and characterization of NmU, describe the discovery, cloning, distribution, and structure of its two receptors, and outline its possible roles in both physiology and pathophysiology. Ultimately the development of receptor-specific ligands and the generation of animals in which the receptors have been selectively knocked out will hopefully reveal the true extent of the biological roles of NmU and suggest novel therapeutic indications for selective activation or blockade of either of its receptors.',\n",

The molecular mechanisms by which lactoferrin exerts these biological actions are not known, but lactoferrin is known to bind to two members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, low- density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 1 (LRP1) and 2 (LRP2). We have examined the role(s) of these receptors in the actions of lactoferrin on osteoblasts. We show that lactoferrin binds to cultured osteoblastic cells, and that LRP1 and LRP2 are expressed in several osteoblastic cell types. In primary rat osteoblastic cells, the LRP1/2 inhibitor receptor associated protein blocks endocytosis of lactoferrin and abrogates lactoferrin-induced p42/44 MAPK signaling and mitogenesis. Lactoferrin-induced mitogenesis is also inhibited by an antibody to LRP1. Lactoferrin also induces receptor associated protein-sensitive activation of p42/44 MAPK signaling and proliferation in osteoblastic human SaOS-2 cells, which express LRP1 but not LRP2. The mitogenic response of LRP1-null fibroblastic cells to lactoferrin is substantially reduced compared with that of cells expressing wild-type LRP1. The endocytic and signaling functions of LRP1 are independent of each other, because lactoferrin can activate mitogenic signaling in conditions in which endocytosis is inhibited. Taken together, these results 1) suggest that mitogenic signaling through LRP1 to p42/44 MAPKs contributes to the anabolic skeletal actions of lactoferrin; 2) demonstrate growth-promoting actions of a third LRP family member in osteoblasts; and 3) provide further evidence that LRP1 functions as a signaling receptor in addition to its recognized role in ligand endocytosis.',\n",

FPR is the founding member of a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors thought to function in inflammatory processes. The other two members, FPR-like (FPRL)1 and FPRL2, have a greatly reduced affinity for bacterial peptides or do not bind them at all, with FPRL2 being considered an orphan receptor so far. In this study we show that a peptide derived from the N-terminal domain of the anti-inflammatory protein annexin 1 (lipocortin 1) can activate all three FPR family members at similar concentrations. The annexin 1 peptide initiates chemotactic responses in human monocytes that express all three FPR family members and also desensitizes the cells toward subsequent stimulation with bacterial peptide agonists. Experiments using HEK 293 cells stably expressing a single FPR family member reveal that all three receptors can be activated and desensitized by the N-terminal annexin 1 peptide. These observations identify the annexin 1 peptide as the first endogenous ligand of FPRL2 and indicate that annexin 1 participates in regulating leukocyte emigration into inflamed tissue by activating and desensitizing different receptors of the FPR family.',\n",

BMPs bind to type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors to initiate intracellular signalling.

To identify novel interacting proteins and explore signalling pathways that can be initiated by BMPR-II, we performed glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays with BMPR-II protein constructs fused to GST and extracts of mouse myoblast C2C12 cells. We generated three constructs which contain different parts of the cytoplasmic region of BMPR-II: full-length cytoplasmic part of BMPR-II, only the kinase domain, or only the C-terminal tail of BMPR-II. Proteins which formed complexes with these BMPR-II constructs were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D GE), and specifically interacting proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). We identified 33 interacting proteins; 11 proteins interacted with the C-terminal tail of BMPR-II, 4 with full-length BMPR-II, and 18 with a short form of the receptor with a deleted tail. Fourteen proteins have assigned functions in various signalling processes, suggesting links of BMP signalling to regulation of MAP kinase pathway, apoptosis, transcription, PKCss, and PKA. Five of the identified proteins are components of the cytoskeleton, and four are enzymes involved in metabolism, e.g., processing of estrogens or lipids. We confirmed interaction of PKC beta and CtBP with BMPR-II using immunodetection.

ALK7 is an orphan receptor serine/threonine kinase expressed in neuroendocrine tissues including pancreatic islets.

CCR2 is the primary receptor for the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) whereas CCR3 is the primary receptor for the chemokines eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3. Both receptors are expressed at >5,000,000 copies per cell, substantially higher levels than in previous cell lines, and both are competent for binding and activation by the cognate chemokines for these receptors. Using these cell lines we confirm that eotaxin-1 and eotaxin-3 can act as an agonist and an antagonist, respectively, of CCR2. In addition, we show that eotaxin-2 is an antagonist of CCR2 and MCP-1 is an agonist of CCR3. Comparison of the chemokine sequences reveals several positions that are identical in MCP-1 and eotaxin-1 but different in eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3, suggesting that these amino acids play a role in CCR2 activation.',\n",

Within the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, signaling to an epithelial cell-specific FGF receptor (FGFR) 2IIIb-heparan sulfate complex from stromal-specific FGF7 and FGF10 delivers directionally specific instruction from stroma to epithelium without autocrine interference. Using a two-compartment transplantable prostate tumor model in which survival of stromal cells in vivo depends on epithelial cells, we show that signaling from epithelial FGF9 to stromal FGFR3 potentially mediates epithelial-to-stromal communication that also is directionally specific. FGF9 mRNA was expressed exclusively in the epithelial cells derived from well-differentiated, two-compartment Dunning R3327 rat prostate tumors. In contrast, FGFR3 was expressed at functionally significant levels only in the derived stromal cells. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation assays revealed that FGF9 only bound to an FGFR on the stromal cells. FGF9 also failed to covalently cross-link to clonal lines of stromal cells devoid of FGFR3 that expressed FGFR1 and FGFR2IIIc. Furthermore, FGF9 specifically stimulated DNA synthesis in stromal cells expressing FGFR3. These results demonstrate a directionally specific paracrine signaling from epithelial FGF9 and stromal FGFR3. Similar to the FGF7/FGF10 to FGFR2IIIb signaling from the stroma to the epithelium, the directional specificity from epithelium to stroma appears set by a combination of cell-specific expression of isoforms and cell-context specificity of FGFR isotypes for FGF.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The identification of new signaling pathways critical for cardiac morphogenesis will contribute to our understanding of congenital heart disease (CHD), which remains a leading cause of mortality in newborn children worldwide. Signals mediated by semaphorin ligands and plexin receptors contribute to the intricate patterning of axons in the central nervous system. Here, we describe a related signaling pathway involving secreted class 3 semaphorins, neuropilins, and a plexin receptor, PlexinD1, expressed by endothelial cells. Interruption of this pathway in mice results in CHD and vascular patterning defects. The type of CHD caused by inactivation of PlexinD1 has previously been attributed to abnormalities of neural crest. Here, we show that this form of CHD can be caused by cell-autonomous endothelial defects. Thus, molecular programs that mediate axon guidance in the central nervous system also function in endothelial cells to orchestrate critical aspects of cardiac morphogenesis.',\n",

Abundant functional information exists for CCL4, however, CCL4L1 has only recently been recognized as a distinct gene, thus information describing it is wanting. The CCL4L1 protein was synthesized in Escherichia coli and compared with the CCL4 protein. Competitive binding studies using HEK-293/CCR5 cells produced comparable EC50 values for the two proteins. Similarly, chemotaxis assays with cells expressing CCR1, CCR3, or CCR5 revealed no substantial differences. CCL4L1 was somewhat more effective at inhibiting HIV-1 replication in PBMCs than was CCL4, however the difference was not statistically significant. These data combined with the observation of individual variation in CCL4L1 gene copy number [Eur. J.

We provide evidence for a novel biological axis that links a soluble fragment of perlecan protein core to the major cell surface receptor for collagen I, alpha2beta1 integrin, and provide an initial investigation of the intracellular signaling events that lead to endorepellin antiangiogenic activity. The interaction between endorepellin and alpha2beta1 integrin triggers a unique signaling pathway that causes an increase in the second messenger cAMP; activation of two proximal kinases, protein kinase A and focal adhesion kinase; transient activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and heat shock protein 27, followed by a rapid down-regulation of the latter two proteins; and ultimately disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. The end result is a profound block of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Because perlecan is present in both endothelial and smooth muscle cell basement membranes, proteolytic activity during the initial stages of angiogenesis could liberate antiangiogenic fragments from blood vessels' walls, including endorepellin.\",\n",

Ectopic expression of Dpl in the central nervous system (CNS) causes neurotoxicity and this effect is rescued by the expression of PrPc.

Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we showed that Dpl binds the full-length 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor protein (LRP), one of the receptors of PrPc. The interaction was also validated by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using transfected cell lines and in vivo derived tissues. Further mapping experiments showed that although the middle fragment containing residues 100-220 of LRP was able to interact with Dpl, deletion of the N-terminal domain of the full-length LRP abolished its interaction with Dpl. These results suggest that while both PrPc and Dpl interact with LRP, the domains that are involved in the binding are not the same. Our results may have implications for the molecular mechanisms of Dpl-PrPc antagonism and physiological roles of Dpl.',\n",

Migration was dependent on an interaction of the kringle domains of plasmin with alpha(9)beta(1) as well as the catalytic activity of plasmin. Angiostatin, representing the kringle domains of plasmin, alone did not induce the migration of alpha(9)-CHO cells, but simultaneous activation of the G protein-coupled protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 with an agonist peptide induced the migration on angiostatin, whereas PAR-2 or PAR-4 agonist peptides were without effect. Furthermore, a small chemical inhibitor of PAR-1 (RWJ 58259) and a palmitoylated PAR-1-blocking peptide inhibited plasmin-induced migration of alpha(9)-CHO cells. These results suggest that plasmin induces migration by kringle-mediated binding to alpha(9)beta(1) and simultaneous proteolytic activation of PAR-1.',\n",

We explored here the contact site between hVPAC1 receptor and the side chain at position 6 of VIP by photoaffinity labeling. The photoreactive para-benzoyl-l-Phe (Bpa) was substituted for Phe(6) in VIP resulting in [Bpa(6)]-VIP, which was shown to be a hVPAC1 receptor agonist in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the recombinant receptor. After obtaining the covalent (125)I-[Bpa(6)-VIP].hVPAC1 receptor complex, it was sequentially cleaved by cyanogen bromide, peptide N-glycosidase F, endopeptidase Glu-C, and trypsin, and the cleavage products were analyzed by electrophoresis. The data demonstrated that (125)I-[Bpa(6)-VIP] were covalently attached to the short 104-108 fragment within the N-terminal ectodomain of the receptor. The data were confirmed by creation of a receptor mutant with new CNBr cleavage site. In a three-dimensional model of the receptor N-terminal ectodomain, this fragment was located on one edge of the putative VIP-binding groove and was adjacent to the fragment covalently attached to the side chain at position 22 of VIP. Altogether these data showed that the central part of VIP, at least between Phe(6) and Tyr(22), interacts with the N-terminal ectodomain of the hVPAC1 receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Growth factors, cell-surface receptors, adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix proteins play critical roles in vascular pathophysiology by affecting growth, migration, differentiation, and survival of vascular cells. In a search for secreted and cell-surface molecules expressed in the cardiovascular system, by using a retrovirus-mediated signal sequence trap method, we isolated a cell-surface protein named vasorin. Vasorin is a typical type I membrane protein, containing tandem arrays of a characteristic leucine-rich repeat motif, an epidermal growth factor-like motif, and a fibronectin type III-like motif at the extracellular domain. Expression analyses demonstrated that vasorin is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, and that its expression is developmentally regulated. To clarify biological functions of vasorin, we searched for its binding partners and found that vasorin directly binds to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and attenuates TGF-beta signaling in vitro. Vasorin expression was down-regulated during vessel repair after arterial injury, and reversal of vasorin down-regulation, by using adenovirus-mediated in vivo gene transfer, significantly diminished injury-induced vascular lesion formation, at least in part, by inhibiting TGF-beta signaling in vivo. These results suggest that down-regulation of vasorin expression contributes to neointimal formation after vascular injury and that vasorin modulates cellular responses to pathological stimuli in the vessel wall. Thus, vasorin is a potential therapeutic target for vascular fibroproliferative disorders.',\n",

In contrast to ephrins, semaphorins, netrins and slits, no receptor mechanism for RGM action has been defined. Here, an expression cloning strategy identified neogenin as a binding site for RGM, with a sub-nanomolar affinity. Consistent with selective axonal responsiveness to RGM, neogenin is expressed in a gradient across the chick retina. Neogenin is known to be one of several netrin-binding proteins but only neogenin interacts with RGM. The avoidance of RGM by temporal retinal axons is blocked by the anti-neogenin antibody and the soluble neogenin ectodomain. Dorsal root ganglion axons are unresponsive to RGM but are converted to a responsive state by neogenin expression. Thus, neogenin functions as an RGM receptor.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"The Wnt signaling pathway is central to the development of all animals and to cancer progression, yet largely unknown are the pairings of secreted Wnt ligands to their respective Frizzled transmembrane receptors or, in many cases, the relative contributions of canonical (beta-catenin/LEF/TCF) versus noncanonical Wnt signals. Specifically, in the kidney where Wnt-4 is essential for the mesenchymal to epithelial transition that generates the tissue's collecting tubules, the corresponding Frizzled receptor(s) and downstream signaling mechanism(s) are unclear. In this report, we addressed these issues using Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, which are competent to form tubules in vitro. Employing established reporter constructs of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activity, we have determined that MDCK cells are highly responsive to Wnt-4, -1, and -3A, but not to Wnt-5A and control conditions, precisely reflecting functional findings from Wnt-4 null kidney mesenchyme ex vivo rescue studies. We have confirmed that Wnt-4's canonical signaling activity in MDCK cells is mediated by downstream effectors of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway using beta-Engrailed and dnTCF-4 constructs that suppress this pathway. We have further found that MDCK cells express the Frizzled-6 receptor and that Wnt-4 forms a biochemical complex with the Frizzled-6 CRD. Since Frizzled-6 did not appear to transduce Wnt-4's canonical signal, data supported recently by Golan et al., there presumably exists another as yet unknown Frizzled receptor(s) mediating Wnt-4 activation of beta-catenin/LEF/TCF. Finally, we report that canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signals cells help maintain cell growth and survival in MDCK cells but do not contribute to standard HGF-induced (nonphysiologic) tubule formation. Our results in combination with work from Xenopus laevis (not shown) lead us to believe that Wnt-4 binds both canonical and noncanonical Frizzled receptors, thereby activating Wnt signaling pathways that may each contribute to kidney tubulogenesis.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'IL-15 and IL-2 are two structurally and functionally related cytokines whose high affinity receptors share the IL-2R beta-chain and gamma-chain in association with IL-15R alpha-chain (IL-15R alpha) or IL-2R alpha-chain, respectively. Whereas IL-2 action seems restricted to the adaptative T cells, IL-15 appears to be crucial for the function of the innate immune responses, and the pleiotropic expression of IL-15 and IL-15R alpha hints at a much broader role for the IL-15 system in multiple cell types and tissues. In this report, using a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay, we show the existence of a soluble form of human IL-15R alpha (sIL-15R alpha) that arises from proteolytic shedding of the membrane-anchored receptor. This soluble receptor is spontaneously released from IL-15R alpha-expressing human cell lines as well as from IL-15R alpha transfected COS-7 cells. This release is strongly induced by PMA and ionomycin, and to a lesser extent by IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. The size of sIL-15R alpha (42 kDa), together with the analysis of deletion mutants in the ectodomain of IL-15R alpha, indicates the existence of cleavage sites that are proximal to the plasma membrane. Whereas shedding induced by PMA was abrogated by the synthetic matrix metalloproteinases inhibitor GM6001, the spontaneous shedding was not, indicating the occurrence of at least two distinct proteolytic mechanisms. The sIL-15R alpha displayed high affinity for IL-15 and behaved as a potent and specific inhibitor of IL-15 binding to the membrane receptor, and of IL-15-induced cell proliferation (IC(50) in the range from 3 to 20 pM). These results suggest that IL-15R alpha shedding may play important immunoregulatory functions.',\n",

This killing is mediated primarily via the natural cytotoxicity receptors, including NKp46, NKp44, NKp30, and by the NKG2D receptor. Killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) are mainly involved in inhibiting NK killing (inhibitory KIRs) via interaction with MHC class I molecules. Some KIRs, however, have been found to enhance NK killing when interacting with MHC class I molecules (activating KIRs). We have previously demonstrated that KIR2DS4, an activating KIR, recognizes the HLA-Cw4 protein. The interaction observed was weak and highly restricted to HLA-Cw4 only. These findings prompted us to check whether KIR2DS4 might have additional ligand(s). In this study, we show that KIR2DS4 is able to also interact with a non-class I MHC protein expressed on melanoma cell lines and on a primary melanoma. This interaction is shown to be both specific and functional. Importantly, site-directed mutagenesis analysis reveals that the amino acid residues involved in the recognition of this novel ligand are different from those interacting with HLA-Cw4. These results may shed new light on the function of activating KIRs and their relevance in NK biology.',\n",

Previous studies have shown that CCL16 is a low-affinity ligand for CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, and CCR8 and attracts monocytes and T cells. Recently, a novel histamine receptor termed type 4 (H4) has been identified and shown to be selectively expressed by eosinophils and mast cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CCL16 induced pertussis toxin-sensitive calcium mobilization and chemotaxis in murine L1.2 cells expressing H4 but not those expressing histamine receptor type 1 (H1) or type 2 (H2). CCL16 bound to H4 with a K(d) of 17 nM. By RT-PCR, human and mouse eosinophils express H4 but not H3. Accordingly, CCL16 induced efficient migratory responses in human and mouse eosinophils. Furthermore, the responses of human and mouse eosinophils to CCL16 were effectively suppressed by thioperamide, an antagonist for H3 and H4. Intravenous injection of CCL16 into mice induced a rapid mobilization of eosinophils from bone marrow to peripheral blood, which was also suppressed by thioperamide. Collectively, CCL16 is a novel functional ligand for H4 and may have a role in trafficking of eosinophils.',\n",

The structure of CXCL11 was determined using solution NMR to allow comparison with that of CXCL10 and help elucidate the source of the differences. CXCL11 takes on the canonical chemokine fold but exhibits greater conformational flexibility than has been observed for related chemokines under the same sample conditions. Unlike related chemokines such as IP-10 and IL-8, ITAC does not appear to form dimers at millimolar concentrations. The origin for this behavior can be found in the solution structure, which indicates a beta-bulge in beta-strand 1 that distorts the dimerization interface used by other CXC chemokines.',\n",

In an initial yeast two-hybrid screen using the C terminus of Na(v)1.6 as a bait, we identified FHF2B, a member of the FGF homologous factor (FHF) subfamily, as an interacting partner of Na(v)1.6. Members of the FHF subfamily share approximately 70% sequence identity, and individual members demonstrate a cell- and tissue-specific expression pattern. FHF2 is abundantly expressed in the hippocampus and DRG neurons and colocalizes with Na(v)1.6 at mature nodes of Ranvier in myelinated sensory fibers in the dorsal root of the sciatic nerve. However, retinal ganglion cells and spinal ventral horn motor neurons show very low levels of FHF2 expression, and their axons exhibit no nodal FHF2 staining within the optic nerve and ventral root, respectively. Thus, FHF2 is selectively localized at nodes of dorsal root sensory but not ventral root motor axons. The coexpression of FHF2B and Na(v)1.6 in the DRG-derived cell line ND7/23 significantly increases the peak current amplitude and causes a 4 mV depolarizing shift of voltage-dependent inactivation of the channel. The preferential expression of FHF2B in sensory neurons may provide a basis for physiological differences in sodium currents that have been reported at the nodes of Ranvier in sensory versus motor axons.',\n",

Accordingly, Ang3 was more potent than Ang4 in phosphorylating Akt in primary cultured mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells.

Adhesion of cells that express one dominant beta(1) integrin on immobilized type 1 repeats is specifically inhibited by antagonists of that integrin, whereas adhesion of cells that express several beta(1) integrins is partially inhibited by each alpha-subunit-specific antagonist and completely inhibited by combining the antagonists. beta(1) integrins recognize both the second and third type 1 repeats, and each type 1 repeat shows pan-beta(1) specificity and divalent cation dependence for promoting cell adhesion. Adhesion to the type 2 repeats is less sensitive to alpha-subunit antagonists, but a beta(1) blocking antibody and two disintegrins inhibit adhesion to immobilized type 2 repeats. beta(1) integrin expression is necessary for cell adhesion to the type 1 or type 2 repeats, and beta(1) integrins bind in a divalent cation-dependent manner to a type 1 repeat affinity column. The widely used TSP1 function blocking antibody A4.1 binds to a site in the third type 2 repeat. A4.1 proximally inhibits beta(1) integrin-dependent adhesion to the type 2 repeats and indirectly inhibits integrin-dependent adhesion mediated by the TSP1 type 1 repeats. Although antibody A4.1 is also an antagonist of CD36 binding to TSP1, these data suggest that some biological activities of A4.1 result from antagonism of these novel beta(1) integrin binding sites.',\n",

Recently, two G-protein-coupled receptors for NmU (NmU1R and NmU2R) have been cloned having approximately 50% homology. They have distinct patterns of expression suggesting they may have different biological functions. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of both NmU receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. [125I]hNmU binding to the recombinant NmU receptors was rapid, saturable, of high affinity and to a single population of binding sites. Exposure of these cells to NmU isopeptides resulted in an increase in intracellular [Ca2+]i release (EC50 value of 0.50 +/- 0.10 nmol/l) and inositol phosphate formation (EC50 1.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.50 +/- 0.4 nmol/l for NmU1R and NmU2R respectively). Furthermore, hNmU inhibited forskolin (3 micromol/l)-stimulated accumulation of cAMP in intact HEK-293 cells expressing either NmU1R or NmU2R. The inhibitory effect was significant for the cells expressing NmU2R with IC50 value of 0.80 +/- 0.21 nmol/l. In summary, both NmU1R and NmU2R in HEK-293 cells have similar signaling capability.',\n",

The existence of a third SIRP protein has been suggested by cDNA sequence only. We show that this third SIRP is a separate gene that is expressed as a protein with unique characteristics from both alpha and beta genes and suggest that this gene should be termed SIRPgamma. We have expressed the extracellular region of SIRPgamma as a soluble protein and have shown that, like SIRPalpha, it binds CD47, but with a lower affinity (K(d), approximately 23 microM) compared with SIRPalpha (K(d), approximately 2 microM). mAbs specific to SIRPgamma show that it was not expressed on myeloid cells, in contrast to SIRPalpha and -beta, being expressed instead on the majority of T cells and a proportion of B cells. The short cytoplasmic tail of SIRPgamma does not contain any known signaling motifs, nor does it contain a characteristic lysine, as with SIRPbeta, that is required for DAP12 interaction. DAP12 coexpression is a requirement for SIRPbeta surface expression, whereas SIRPgamma is expressed in its absence. The SIRPgamma-CD47 interaction may therefore not be capable of bidirectional signaling as with the SIRPalpha-CD47, but, instead, use unidirectional signaling via CD47 only.',\n",

Here, we report that a neuropeptide, neuropeptide S (NPS), potently modulates wakefulness and could also regulate anxiety. NPS acts by activating its cognate receptor (NPSR) and inducing mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. The NPSR mRNA is widely distributed in the brain, including the amygdala and the midline thalamic nuclei. Central administration of NPS increases locomotor activity in mice and decreases paradoxical (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep in rats. NPS was further shown to produce anxiolytic-like effects in mice exposed to four different stressful paradigms. Interestingly, NPS is expressed in a previously undefined cluster of cells located between the locus coeruleus (LC) and Barrington's nucleus. These results indicate that NPS could be a new modulator of arousal and anxiety. They also show that the LC region encompasses distinct nuclei expressing different arousal-promoting neurotransmitters.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Integrins are a complex family of divalent cation-dependent cell adhesion receptors composed of one alpha and one beta subunit noncovalently bound to one another. A subset of integrins contains the alpha v subunit in association with one of several beta subunits (e.g. beta 3, beta 5, beta 1). We have recently identified a novel integrin beta subunit, beta 6, that is present in a number of epithelial cell lines. Using a polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of beta 6, we have now identified the integrin heterodimer, alpha v beta 6, on the surface of two human carcinoma cell lines. Using affinity chromatography of lysates from the pancreatic carcinoma cell line, FG-2, we demonstrate that alpha v beta 6 binds to fibronectin, but not to vitronectin or collagen I. In contrast, the alpha v beta 5 integrin, which is also expressed on FG-2 cells, binds exclusively to vitronectin. Immobilized collagen I does not interact with alpha v integrins, but binds beta 1-containing integrins. Both alpha v beta 6 and alpha v beta 5 are eluted from their respective immobilized ligands by a hexa-peptide containing the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). RGD is highly effective in the presence of Ca2+, somewhat less effective in Mg2+, and virtually inactive in Mn2+. These results suggest that alpha v beta 6 functions as an RGD-dependent fibronectin receptor in FG-2 carcinoma cells. In agreement with this notion, cell adhesion assays show that FG-2 cell attachment to fibronectin is only partially inhibited by anti-beta 1 integrin antibodies, implying that other fibronectin receptors may be involved. Taken together with recent reports on the vitronectin receptor function of alpha v beta 5, our results suggest that the previously described carcinoma cell integrin, alpha v beta x (Cheresh, D. A., Smith, J. W., Cooper, H. M., and Quaranta, V. (1989) Cell 57, 59-69), is a mixture of at least two different receptors: alpha v beta 5, mediating adhesion to vitronectin, and alpha v beta 6, mediating adhesion to fibronectin.',\n",

We have found that Sema4D stimulates axonal outgrowth of embryonic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones in stead of retraction. Neutralizing antibodies to Sema4D inhibit this action. This action appears to differ slightly from that on PC12 cells, because DRG neurones respond to Sema4D without addition of nerve growth factor (NGF), while PC12 cells do not. On the other hand, it is blocked by deprivation of endogenous NGF with antibodies to NGF and also by Trk-inhibitor K252a, suggesting that endogenously produced-NGF and the activation of Trk receptor are required for Sema4D-action on DRG neurones. These indicate that neurite-outgrowth promoting actions of Sema4D are similar between DRG neurones and PC12 cells, since NGF-Trk signalling are required for these actions. Since Schwann cells can produce NGF, the contamination of these cells in our DRG culture might explain this action. In addition to plexin-B1 that is known as a Sema4D receptor, binding experiments indicate plexin-B2 as another receptor candidate for Sema4D. These plexins and Sema4D are expressed in embryonic DRGs. We suggest a new function of Sema4D as a neurite-outgrowth stimulating, autocrine/paracrine factor in embryonic sensory neurones.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'The neuropeptide neuromedin U (NmU) shows considerable structural conservation across species. Within the body, it is widely distributed and in mammals has been implicated in physiological roles, including the regulation of feeding, anxiety, pain, blood flow, and smooth muscle contraction. Human NmU-25 (hNmU-25) and other NmU analogs were recently identified as ligands for two human orphan G protein-coupled receptors, subsequently named hNmU-R1 and hNmU-R2. These receptors have approximately 50% amino acid homology, and, at least in mammalian species, NmU-R1 and NmU-R2 are expressed predominantly in the periphery and central nervous system, respectively. Here, we have characterized signaling mediated by hNmU-R1 and hNmU-R2 expressed as recombinant proteins in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, particularly to define their G protein coupling and the activation and regulation of signal transduction pathways. We show that these receptors couple to both Galpha(q/11) and Galpha(i). Activation of either receptor type causes a pertussis toxin-insensitive activation of both phospholipase C and mitogen activated-protein kinase and a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with subnanomolar potency for each. Activation of phospholipase C is sustained, but despite this capacity for prolonged receptor activation, repetitive application of hNmU-25 does not cause repetitive intracellular Ca2+ signaling by either recombinant receptors or those expressed endogenously in isolated smooth muscle cells from rat fundus. Using several strategies, we show this to be a consequence of essentially irreversible binding of hNmU-25 to its receptors and that this is followed by ligand internalization. Despite structural differences between receptors, there were no apparent differences in their activation, coupling, or regulation.',\n",

J-2156 binds with nanomolar affinity to the human somatostatin receptor subtype 4 and is over 400-fold subtype-selective against the other somatostatin receptors. When evaluated in a [(35)S]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio) triphosphate binding assay, J-2156 elicited a response 2 to 3 times as large as that of somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14. That somatostatin-14 is clearly not a maximally efficacious agonist could be verified by demonstrating that it displays the typical behavior of a partial agonist when tested against J-2156. Increasing concentrations of somatostatin-14 cause a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the dose-response curves for J-2156, without affecting its maximal response. This lack of reduction of the maximal response and the fact that the superior efficacy of J-2156 is detected in membranes argue against desensitization and internalization as possible explanations for the superior efficacy of J-2156. More likely is that somatostatin-14 and J-2156 stabilize distinct receptor conformations that differ in their ability to interact with G-proteins. In a cyclic AMP assay, J-2156, somatostatin-28, and somatostatin-14 all act as full agonists. However, this outcome is most likely due to the presence of a receptor reserve in the cyclic AMP assay since there is a large gain of apparent potency in the cyclic AMP assay and the gain is larger for J-2156 than for somatostatin. We conclude that the endogenous ligands somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 do not define maximal agonism on the human somatostatin receptor subtype 4 and that J-2156 represents a so-called superagonist.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Apelin is a novel neuropeptide involved in the regulation of body fluid homeostasis and cardiovascular functions. It acts through a G protein-coupled receptor, the APJ receptor. We studied the structure-activity relationships of apelin at the rat apelin receptor, tagged at its C-terminal end with enhanced green fluorescent protein and stably expressed in CHO cells. We evaluated the potency of N- and C-terminal deleted fragments of K17F to bind with high affinity to the apelin receptor, and to inhibit cAMP production and to induce apelin receptor internalization. We first characterized the internalization and trafficking of the rat apelin receptor. This receptor was internalized via a clathrin-dependent mechanism and our results suggest that receptor trafficking may follow a recycling pathway. We then tried to identify the amino acids of K17F required for apelin activity. The first five N-terminal and the last two C-terminal amino acids of K17F were not essential for apelin binding or the inhibition of cAMP production. However, the full-length sequence of K17F was the most potent inducer of apelin receptor internalization because successive N-terminal amino-acid deletions progressively reduced internalization and the removal of a single amino acid at the C-terminus abolished this process. Finally, the most novel observation of this work is that hypotensive actions of apelin peptides correlate best with the ability of those ligands to internalize. Thus, apelin receptor signaling and endocytosis are functionally dissociated, possibly reflecting the existence of several conformational states of this receptor, stabilized by the binding of different apelin fragments to the apelin receptor.',\n",

To better define the ICAM-4 integrin receptor specificity, cell transfectants individually expressing various integrins were used to demonstrate that alphaLbeta2, alphaMbeta2, and alphaIIbbeta3 (activated) bind specifically and dose dependently to the recombinant ICAM-4-Fc protein. We also show that cell surface ICAM-4 interacts with the cell surface alphaVbeta3 integrin. In addition, using a alpha4beta1 cell transfectant and beta2 integrin-deficient LAD cells, we show here that ICAM-4 failed to interact with alpha4beta1 even after alpha4beta1 activation by phorbol ester or with the monoclonal antibody TS2/16 (+ Mn2+). ICAM-4 amino acids that are critical for alphaIIbbeta3 and alphaVbeta3 interaction were identified by domain deletion analysis, site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptide inhibition. Our results provide evidence that the beta3 integrin binding sites encompass the first and second Ig-like domains of ICAM-4. However, while the alphaIIbbeta3 contact site comprises the ABED face of domain D1 with an extension in the C'-E loop of domain D2, the alphaVbeta3 contact site comprises residues on both faces of D1 and in the C'-E loop of D2. These data, together with our previous results, demonstrate that different integrins bind to different but partly overlapping sites on ICAM-4, and that ICAM-4 may accommodate multiple integrin receptors present on leukocytes, platelets and endothelial cells.\",\n",

Am. Soc. Nephrol. 11, 595-603]. Discrete segments of the nephron express several defined beta1 integrins, suggesting that ADAM9 interacts with multiple renal integrins and thereby regulates epithelial cell-matrix interactions. Intact ADAM9 and a series of deletion constructs sequentially lacking the metalloprotease domain and the disintegrin domain were assembled as chimaeras with a C-terminal GFP (green fluorescent protein) tag. Stable expression of the ADAM9/GFP protein on the surface of HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells) significantly decreased adhesion to types I and IV collagen, vitronectin and laminin, but had little effect on adhesion to fibronectin. Expression of the disintegrin/cysteine-rich/GFP construct yielded a similar, but more marked pattern of decreased adhesion. Expression of the cysteine-rich/GFP construct had no effect on adhesion, indicating that the disintegrin domain was responsible for the competitive inhibition of cell-matrix binding. To define the specific renal tubular beta1 integrins interacting with the ADAM9 disintegrin domain, a recombinant GST (glutathione S-transferase)-disintegrin protein was used as a substrate in adhesion assays in the presence or absence of specific integrin-blocking antibodies. Inclusion of antibodies to alpha1, alpha3, alpha6, alphav and beta1 blocked adhesion of HEK-293 cells to GST-disintegrin protein. Immobilized GST-disintegrin domain perfused with renal cortical lysates specifically recovered the alpha3, alpha6, alphav and beta1 integrin chains by Western analysis. It is concluded that ADAM9 is a polyvalent ligand, through its disintegrin domain, for multiple renal integrins of the beta1 class.',\n",

Mouse and rat GPCR135 exhibit high homology (>85%) to the human GPCR135 and have very similar pharmacological properties to that of the human GPCR135. Human and mouse/rat relaxin-3 both bind to and activate mouse, rat, and human GPCR135 at high affinity with IC(50) or EC(50) values close to 0.5 nM. In contrast, the mouse GPCR142 is less well conserved (74% homology) with human GPCR142. The rat GPCR142 gene was found to be a pseudogene. We further cloned GPCR142 genes from monkey, cow, and pig and found that they are highly homologous (>84%) to human GPCR142. Pharmacological characterization of GPCR142 from different species demonstrated that relaxin-3 binds to GPCR142 from different species at high affinity (IC(50) < 5 nM). However, relaxin-3 does not stimulate a Ca(2+) response in cells coexpressing Galpha(16) and mouse GPCR142, whereas it does for cells expressing GPCR142 from other species tested. Our results suggest that GPCR142 may have a diminished role as a receptor for relaxin-3 in rodents, or perhaps GPCR142 functions as a receptor for another ligand in nonrodents. Boels and Schaller recently reported bradykinin as a ligand for GPCR142 (also known as GPR100).

To determine the function of each isoform, cDNA for CS1-L and CS1-S were transfected into the rat NK cell line RNK-16 and functionally tested using redirected cytotoxicity assays and calcium flux experiments. CS1-L was able to mediate redirected cytotoxicity of P815 target cells in the presence of monoclonal antibody against CS1 and a rise in intracellular calcium within RNK-16 cells, suggesting that CS1-L is an activating receptor, whereas CS1-S showed no effects. Interestingly, SAP associated with unstimulated CS1-L and dissociated upon pervanadate stimulation.

Efficient accession of the cross-presentation pathway requires APC receptor-mediated endocytosis of the chaperone/peptide complexes. Previously, scavenger receptor class-A (SRA) was shown to play a substantial role in trafficking gp96 and calreticulin into macrophages, accounting for half of total receptor-mediated uptake. However, the scavenger receptor ligand fucoidin competed the chaperone uptake beyond that accounted for by SRA, indicating that another scavenger receptor(s) may also contribute. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that the residual calreticulin uptake into SRA(-/-) macrophages is competed by the scavenger receptor ligand acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL). We now report that an additional scavenger receptor, SREC-I (scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cell-I), mediates the endocytosis of calreticulin and gp96. Ectopic expression of SREC-I in Chinese hamster ovary cells yielded chaperone recognition and uptake, and these processes were competed by the inhibitory ligands fucoidin and acetylated (Ac)LDL. Although AcLDL competes for the chaperone interactions with SRA and SREC, we showed that not all of the scavenger receptors, which bind AcLDL, bind calreticulin or gp96. The overexpression of SREC-I in macrophages increased chaperone endocytosis, indicating that SREC-I functions in APCs and that the cytosolic components necessary for the endocytosis of SREC-I and its cargo are present and not limiting in APCs. These data identify a novel class of ligands for SREC-I and provide insight into the mechanisms by which APCs and potentially endothelial cells traffic chaperone/antigen complexes.',\n",

Despite binding to Ror2, neither Wnt1 nor Wnt3 altered receptor activity as assessed by levels of Ror2 autophosphorylation. The ability of Ror2 to regulate canonical Wnt signaling in osteoblastic cells should have physiological consequences in bone, because Wnt signaling is known to modulate osteoblast survival and differentiation. Expression of Ror2 mRNA was highly regulated in a biphasic manner during human osteoblast differentiation, being virtually undetectable in pluripotent stem cells, increasing 300-fold in committed preosteoblasts, and disappearing again in osteocytes. Furthermore, Ror2 expression in osteoblasts was suppressed by the Wnt antagonist, secreted frizzled-related protein 1. The regulated expression of Ror2 during osteoblast differentiation, its inverse expression pattern with secreted frizzled-related protein 1, and its ability to modulate Wnt signaling in osteoblastic cells suggest that Ror2 may regulate bone formation.',\n",

LIF is structurally and functionally related to another cytokine, Oncostatin M (OSM), that binds to the high-affinity LIF receptor but not to the low-affinity LIF receptor. A complementary DNA was isolated that encodes the high-affinity converting subunit of the LIF receptor. The converter conferred high-affinity binding of both LIF and OSM when expressed with the low-affinity LIF receptor and is identical to the signal transducing subunit of the IL-6 receptor, gp130. The gp130 subunit alone confers low-affinity binding of OSM when expressed in COS-7 cells.

       "  'Abstract': 'The human corticotropin-releasing factor (hCRF) receptors CRF1 and CRF2(a) couple to the Gs protein. It has been postulated that CRF receptors may also signal through phospholipase C (PLC). To test this hypothesis, binding and signaling properties were determined for both receptor subtypes stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) and human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells. CRF receptors were highly expressed and strongly coupled to Gs in HEK293 and SK-N-MC cells. However, when the calcium mobilization pathway was investigated, marked differences were observed. In SK-N-MC cells, neither CRF receptor stimulated calcium mobilization in the fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) assay, whereas activation of orexin type 1 and 2 receptors stably expressed in SK-N-MC cells revealed robust calcium responses. In contrast, intracellular calcium was strongly mobilized by agonist stimulation of hCRF1 and hCRF2(a) receptors in HEK293 cells. In HEK293 cells, potency rank orders for calcium and cAMP responses were identical for both receptors, despite a rightward shift of the dose-response curves. Complete inhibition of calcium signaling of both hCRF1 and hCRF2(a) receptors was observed in the presence of the PLC inhibitor U-73,122 whereas ryanodine, an inhibitor of calcium release channels and the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-cAMPS were ineffective. Finally, CRF agonists produced a small but significant stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) accumulation in hCRF1-and hCRF2(a)-transfected HEK293 cells. These data clearly show that phospholipase C-mediated signaling of CRF receptors is dependent upon the cellular background and that in HEK293 cells human CRF receptors robustly respond in the FLIPR format.',\n",

We investigated the role of Semaphorin3D (Sema3D) in the formation of the early axon pathways in the zebrafish CNS. Morpholino knock-down shows that Sema3D is essential for the correct formation of two early axon pathways. Sema3D appears to guide axons of the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (nucMLF) by repulsion and modulation of fasciculation. In contrast, Sema3D appears to be attractive to telencephalic neurons that form the anterior commissure (AC). Knock-down of Neuropilin-1A (Npn-1A) phenocopied the effects of Sema3D knock-down on the nucMLF axons, and knock-down of either Npn-1A or Npn-2B phenocopied the defects of the AC. Furthermore, simultaneous partial knock-down experiments demonstrated genetic interactions among Sema3D, Npn-1A, and Npn-2B.

       "  'Abstract': 'Relaxin-3, the most recently identified member of relaxin/insulin family, is an agonist for leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor (LGR)7, GPCR135, and GPCR142. LGR7 can be pharmacologically differentiated from GPCR135 and GPCR142 by its high affinity for relaxin. Selective ligands that specifically activate GPCR135 or GPCR142 are highly desirable for studying their functional roles. We have created chimeric peptides that consist of the B-chain of human relaxin-3 in combination with various A-chains from other members of the relaxin/insulin family. Pharmacological characterization of these chimeric peptides indicates the A-chain from relaxin-1, relaxin-2, insulin-like peptide (INSL)3, and INSL6 does not change the pharmacological properties of relaxin-3 significantly. In contrast, substitution of the relaxin-3 A-chain with the A-chain from INSL5 results in a chimeric peptide that selectively activates GPCR135 and GPCR142 over LGR7. This study demonstrates that the A-chains among some of the insulin/relaxin family members are pharmacologically exchangeable. The relaxin-3/INSL5 chimeric peptide is a potential tool to study in vivo function of GPCR135. In addition, because of the substitution of a very hydrophobic peptide (the A-chain of relaxin-3) with a very hydrophilic peptide (the A-chain from INSL5), the radiolabeled (125)I-relaxin-3/INSL5 chimera is a suitable ligand (high-affinity, low-nonspecific binding) for receptor autoradiographic studies on tissue sections.',\n",

So far, receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta, low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related protein and anaplastic lymphoma kinase have been identified as receptors for midkine. We found beta1 integrin in midkine-binding proteins from 13-day-old mouse embryos. beta1-Integrin bound to a midkine-agarose column and was eluted mostly with EDTA. Further study revealed that the alpha-subunits capable of binding to midkine were alpha4 and alpha6. Purified alpha4beta1- and alpha6beta1-integrins bound midkine. Anti-alpha4 antibody inhibited the midkine-dependent migration of osteoblastic cells, and anti-alpha6 antibody inhibited the midkine-dependent neurite outgrowth of embryonic neurons. After midkine treatment, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, an integrin-associated molecule, was transiently increased in osteoblastic cells. Therefore, we concluded that alpha4beta1- and alpha6beta1-integrins are functional receptors for midkine. We observed that the low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related-protein-6 ectodomain was immunoprecipitated with alpha6beta1-integrin and alpha4beta1-integrin. The low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related-protein-6 ectodomain was also immunoprecipitated with receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta. alpha4beta1- and alpha6beta1-Integrins are expected to co-operate with other midkine receptors, possibly in a multimolecular complex that contains other midkine receptors.',\n",

The major functions of megalin in vivo remain incompletely defined as megalin typically faces specialized milieus such as glomerular filtrate, airways, epididymal fluid, thyroid colloid, and yolk sac fluid, which lack many of its known ligands. In the course of studies on ANG II internalization, we were surprised when only part of the uptake of labeled ANG II into immortalized yolk sac cells (BN-16 cells) was blocked by specific peptide inhibitors and direct competitors of the angiotensin type 1 receptor. This led us to test if megalin was a receptor for ANG II. Four lines of direct evidence demonstrate that megalin and, to a lesser extent, its chaperone protein cubilin are receptors for ANG II. First, in BN-16 cells anti-megalin and anti-cubilin antisera interfere with ANG II uptake. Second, also in BN-16 cells, pure ANG II competes for uptake of a known megalin ligand. Third, in proximal tubule cell brush-border membrane vesicles extracted from mice, anti-megalin antisera interfere with ANG II binding. Fourth, purified megalin binds ANG II directly in surface plasmon resonance experiments. The finding that megalin is a receptor for ANG II suggests a major new function for the megalin pathway in vivo. These results also indicate that ANG II internalization in some tissues is megalin dependent and that megalin may play a role in regulating proximal tubule ANG II levels.',\n",

The present study characterizes the integrin binding properties of the disintegrin-like domains of human ADAM7, ADAM28 and ADAM33 with the integrins alpha4beta1, alpha4beta7 and alpha9beta1. Cell-adhesion assays demonstrated that, similar to ADAM28, the ADAM7 disintegrin domain supported alpha4beta1-dependent Jurkat cell adhesion, whereas the ADAM33 disintegrin domain did not. The lymphocyte integrin alpha4beta7 was also found to recognize both disintegrin domains of ADAM7 and ADAM28, but not of ADAM33. This is the first demonstration that mammalian disintegrins are capable of interacting with alpha4beta7. All three disintegrin domains supported alpha9beta1-dependent cell adhesion. Recognition by both alpha4beta1 and alpha4beta7 of ADAM7 and ADAM28 was activation-dependent, requiring either the presence of Mn2+ or an activating monoclonal antibody for cell attachment. Charge-to-alanine mutagenesis experiments revealed that the same residues within an individual ADAM disintegrin domain function in recognizing multiple integrins. However, the residues within a specific region of each ADAM disintegrin-like domain required for integrin binding were distinct. These results establish that ADAM7 and ADAM28 are recognized by the leucocyte integrins alpha4beta1, alpha4beta7 and alpha9beta1.

       "  'Abstract': \"Fluorescence spectroscopy provides a direct method for evaluating the environment of a fluorescent ligand bound to its receptor. We utilized this methodology to determine the environment of Alexa within a cholecystokinin (CCK)-like probe (Alexa488-Gly-[(Nle(28,31))CCK-26-33]; CCK-8 probe) bound to the type A CCK receptor (Harikumar, K. G., Pinon, D. L., Wessels, W. S., Prendergast, F. G., and Miller, L. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 18552-18560). Here, we study this probe at the type B CCK receptor and develop another probe with its fluorophore closer to the carboxyl-terminal pharmacophore of type B receptor ligands (Alexa488-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2; CCK-4 probe). Both probes bound to type B CCK receptors in a saturable and specific manner and represented full agonists. Similar to the type A receptor, at the type B receptor these probes exhibited shorter lifetimes and lower anisotropy when the receptor was in the active conformation than when it was shifted to its inactive, G protein-uncoupled state using guanosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]-triphosphate trisodium salt. Absolute values for lifetime and anisotropy were lower for the CCK-8 probe bound to the type B receptor than for this probe bound to the type A receptor, and Alexa fluorescence was more easily quenched by iodide at the type B receptor. This represents the first direct evidence that, despite having identical affinities for binding and potencies for activating type A and B receptors, CCK is docked via distinct mechanisms, with the amino terminus more exposed to the aqueous milieu when bound to the type B CCK receptor than to the type A CCK receptor. Of interest, despite this difference in binding, activation of both receptors results in analogous direction of movement of the fluorescent indicator probes.\",\n",

One exception is a cell surface complex containing promyogenic Ig superfamily members (CDO and BOC) and cadherins. Netrins and their receptors are established regulators of axon guidance, but little is known of their function outside the nervous system. We report here that myoblasts express the secreted factor netrin-3 and its receptor, neogenin. These proteins stimulate myotube formation and enhance myogenic bHLH- and NFAT-dependent transcription. Furthermore, neogenin binds to CDO in a cis fashion, and myoblasts lacking CDO are defective in responding to recombinant netrin.

       "  'Abstract': 'Insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5) is a peptide that belongs to the relaxin/insulin family, and its receptor has not been identified. In this report, we demonstrate that INSL5 is a specific agonist for GPCR142. Human INSL5 displaces the binding of (125)I-relaxin-3 to GPCR142 with a high affinity (K(i) = 1.5 nM). In a saturation binding assay, (125)I-INSL5 binds GPCR142 with a K(d) value of 2.5 nM. In functional guanosine (gamma-thio)-triphosphate binding and cAMP accumulation assays, INSL5 potently activates GPCR142 with EC(50) values of 1.3 and 1.2 nM, respectively. In addition, INSL5 stimulates Ca(2+) mobilization in HEK293 cells expressing GPCR142 and G alpha(16). Overall, INSL5 behaves as an agonist for GPCR142 similar to relaxin-3. However, unlike relaxin-3, which is also a potent agonist for GPCR135 and LGR7, INSL5 does not activate either GPCR135 or LGR7. INSL5 inhibits (125)I-relaxin-3 binding to GPCR135 with a low potency (K(i) = 500 nM). A functional assay shows that INSL5 (1 microm) is a weak antagonist for GPCR135. In addition, INSL5 (up to 1 microm) shows no affinity or activity at LGR7 or LGR8 either in a binding assay or a bio-functional assay. Previously, we have demonstrated that GPCR142 mRNA is expressed in peripheral tissues, particularly in the colon. Here we show that INSL5 mRNA is expressed in many peripheral tissues, similar to GPCR142. The high affinity interaction between INSL5 and GPCR142 coupled with their co-evolution and partially overlapping tissue expression patterns strongly suggest that INSL5 is an endogenous ligand for GPCR142.',\n",

The fusion constructs had an increase in apparent affinity selectively for glucagon, suggesting that (beta)arr2 interaction locks the receptor in a high-affinity conformation, which can be explored by some, but not all, ligands. The fusion constructs adopted a signaling phenotype governed by the tethered (beta)arr2 with an attenuated G protein-mediated cAMP signal and a higher maximal internalization compared with wild-type receptors. This distinct phenotype of the fusion proteins can not be mimicked by coexpressing wild-type receptor with (beta)arr2. However, when the wild-type receptor was coexpressed with both (beta)arr2 and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5, a phenotype similar to that observed for the fusion constructs was observed. We conclude that the glucagon-like peptide 1 fusion construct mimics the natural interaction of the receptor with (beta)arr2 with respect to binding peptide ligands, G protein-mediated signaling and internalization, and that this distinct molecular phenotype is reminiscent of that which has previously been characterized for family A G protein-coupled receptors, suggesting similarities in the effect of (beta)arr interaction between family A and B receptors also at the molecular level.',\n",

In this study we investigated whether SAA is a ligand for the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and how SAA may influence SR-BI-mediated HDL binding and selective cholesteryl ester uptake. Studies using Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing SR-BI showed that (125)I-labeled SAA, both in lipid-free form and in reconstituted HDL particles, functions as a high affinity ligand for SR-BI. SAA also bound with high affinity to the hepatocyte cell line, HepG2. Alexa-labeled SAA was shown by fluorescence confocal microscopy to be internalized by cells in a SR-BI-dependent manner. To assess how SAA association with HDL influences HDL interaction with SR-BI, SAA-containing HDL was isolated from mice overexpressing SAA through adenoviral gene transfer. SAA presence on HDL had little effect on HDL binding to SR-BI but decreased (30-50%) selective cholesteryl ester uptake. Lipid-free SAA, unlike lipid-free apoA-I, was an effective inhibitor of both SR-BI-dependent binding and selective cholesteryl ester uptake of HDL.

Mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor Ror2 cause brachydactyly type B (BDB). Mutations in GDF5, a member of the BMP/TGF-beta ligand family, cause brachydactyly type C (BDC) whereas mutations in the receptor for GDF5, BRI-b, cause brachydactyly type A2 (BDA2). There is considerable degree of phenotypic overlap between the subtypes BDB, BDC and BDA2. Here we demonstrate that all three components are involved in GDF5 induced regulation of chondrogenesis. We show that Ror2 (tyrosine kinase receptor) and BRI-b (serine/threonine kinase receptor) form a ligand independent heteromeric complex. The frizzled-like-CRD domain of Ror2 is required for this complex. Within that complex Ror2 gets transphosphorylated by BRI-b. We show that Ror2 modulates GDF5 signalling by inhibition of Smad1/5 signalling and by activating a Smad-independent pathway. Both pathways however, are needed for chondrogenic differentiation as demonstrated in ATDC5 cells. The functional interaction of Ror2 with GDF5 and BRI-b was genetically confirmed by the presence of epistatic effects in crosses of Ror2, BRI-b and Gdf5 deficient mice. These results indicate for the first time a direct interaction of Ser/Thr- and Tyr-Kinase receptors and provide evidence for modulation of the Smad-pathway and GDF5 triggered chondrogenesis.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'In recent years, many new recombinant protein therapeutics have been developed and tested in clinical trials [1]. Current and future clinical uses of recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH; Thyrogen, Genzyme) in thyroid diseases are discussed in the review published in this issue of Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy [2]. As Thyrogen is a wild-type rhTSH produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, it has relatively low affinity to the human TSH receptor. Such low affinity and weak intrinsic bioactivity of rhTSH, compared to the bovine or rodent TSH, may help to explain the results of several studies indicating limited clinical efficacy of Thyrogen. TSH analogues with largely increased receptor affinity, potency and efficacy, are expected to provide not only more effective than currently used diagnostic methods, but should also serve as indispensable second-generation thyrotropins for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid carcinomas with a largely limited number of TSH receptors.',\n",

However, until now the mechanisms by which the integrin alpha9beta1 modulates lymphangiogenesis have not been described. In this study we show that adhesion to and migration on the lymphangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF-C and -D) are alpha9beta1-dependent. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human colon carcinoma cells (SW-480) transfected to express alpha9beta1 adhered and/or migrated on both growth factors in a concentration-dependent fashion, and both adhesion and migration were abrogated by anti-alpha9beta1 function-blocking antibody. In SW-480 cells, which lack cognate receptors for VEGF-C and -D, both growth factors induced alpha9beta1-dependent Erk and paxillin phosphorylation. Human microvascular endothelial cells, which express both alpha9beta1 and VEGF-R3, also adhered to and migrated on both growth factors, and both responses were blocked by anti-alpha9beta1 antibody. Furthermore, in a solid phase binding assay recombinant VEGF-C and -D bound to purified alpha9beta1 integrin in a dose- and cation-dependent fashion showing that VEGF-C and VEGF-D are ligands for the integrin alpha9beta1. The interaction between alpha9beta1 and VEGF-C and/or -D may begin to explain the abnormal lymphatic phenotype of the alpha9 knock-out mice.',\n",

Understanding how extracellular Wnt ligands interact with transmembrane receptors to activate intracellular signaling cascades is of broad importance to biology and to human disease because of the roles for Wnt in embryogenesis, cancer, and neural development and plasticity. The functions and properties of Ryk, a receptor tyrosine kinase-like protein, in canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling are beginning to be uncovered. Biochemical and genetic studies reveal that the extracellular regions of Ryk and Fz can form a mutual ligand-binding domain. It remains to be seen whether Ryk can form similar complexes with other Wnt-binding proteins. If divergent transmembrane proteins can combine interchangeably to form heteromeric Wnt receptor complexes, then a stunning diversity of signaling responses might be mediated through differential expression and localization of these proteins in target cells.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': \"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is implicated as a factor promoting tissue fibrosis in several disorders, including diabetic nephropathy. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which it functions is not known. CTGF rapidly activates several intracellular signaling molecules in human mesangial cells (HMC), including extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2, Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, protein kinase B, CaMK II, protein kinase Calpha, and protein kinase Cdelta, suggesting that it functions via a signaling receptor. Treating HMC with CTGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins 75 to 80 and 140 to 180 kD within 10 min, and Western blot analysis of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates identified the neurotrophin receptor TrkA (molecular weight approximately 140 kD). Cross-linking rCTGF to cell surface proteins with 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) revealed that complexes formed with TrkA and with the general neurotrophin co-receptor p75(NTR). rCTGF stimulated phosphorylation of TrkA (tyr 490, 674/675). K252a, a known selective inhibitor of Trk, blocked this phosphorylation, CTGF-induced activation of signaling proteins, and CTGF-dependent induction of the transcription factor TGF-beta-inducible early gene in HMC. It is concluded that TrkA serves as a tyrosine kinase receptor for CTGF.\",\n",

Visfatin exerted insulin-mimetic effects in cultured cells and lowered plasma glucose levels in mice. Mice heterozygous for a targeted mutation in the visfatin gene had modestly higher levels of plasma glucose relative to wild-type littermates. Surprisingly, visfatin binds to and activates the insulin receptor.

In order to identify the cellular ligands recognized by \"orphan\" triggering receptors, mice were immunized with NK susceptible target cells. mAbs were selected that inhibited NK cytotoxicity and recognized two different molecules of 70 and 60-65 kDa. Tryptic digestion and mass spectra analysis of purified proteins identified these molecules as PVR and Nectin-2, respectively. PVR-Fc and Nectin-2-Fc chimeric molecules stained COS-7 cells expressing the DNAM-1 activating receptor and conversely, PVR and Nectin-2 CHO-K cell transfectants were stained by DNAM-1-Fc. Thus, both PVR and Nectin-2 represent specific ligands for DNAM-1. Importantly, the specific interaction between DNAM-1 (in NK cells) and PVR or Nectin-2 (in target cells) enhanced the NK-mediated lysis of tumor cells that was downregulated by mAb-mediated masking of the receptor or its ligands.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules induce inhibitory signals on natural killer (NK) cells via killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). We recently reported a human single-chain antibody (scFv#1), which recognizes an epitope on HLA-Cw6 (genotype: *0602). Flow cytometry showed scFv#1 binding to HLA-Cw6 (strong) and also to HLA-Cw2, 4, 5 (very weak) but not to HLA-Cw1, 3, 7, 8. The presumptive epitope of the antibody fragment, which includes residues Asn77 and Lys80 was verified by introducing point mutations into HLA-Cw6 encoding cDNAs. Asn77 --> Ser77 (N77S) and Lys80- -> Asn80 (K80N) mutants of Cw6 lost scFv#1 binding capacity whereas an additional mutation at aa position 90 (Asp-->Ala, D90A) did not influence scFv#1 binding characteristics. Since residues 77 and 80 of HLA-C are directly involved in KIR/MHC interaction, we expected the induction of target cell lysis upon addition of scFv#1 when bringing NK and HLA-Cw6 positive cells together. To prove this interference, we performed Cr-release assays, using Cw*0602 and mock-transfected K562 erythroleukemia cells as targets and freshly prepared peripheral blood NK cells as effector cells. scFv#1 appeared to influence KIR on ligand binding and restored lysis at low effector to target (E/T) ratios. Pan HLA class I antibody W6/32 did not show such effects. Taken together scFv#1 binding patterns with mutagenized HLA-Cw6 and Cr-release assays are strong evidence that the scFv#1 epitope on HLA-Cw6 is at or close to the binding site of CD158a.',\n",

However, these signals do not act directly on the myocardium and instead are proposed to regulate the production of an unidentified soluble epicardial derived mitogen. Here, we show that Fgf9, Fgf16, and Fgf20 are expressed in the endocardium and epicardium and that RA can induce epicardial expression of Fgf9. Using knockout mice and an embryonic heart organ culture system, we show that endocardial and epicardial derived FGF signals regulate myocardial proliferation during midgestation heart development. We further show that this FGF signal is received by both FGF receptors 1 and 2 acting redundantly in the cardiomyoblast. In the absence of this signal, premature differentiation results in cellular hypertrophy and newborn mice develop a dilated cardiomyopathy. FGFs thus constitute all or part of the epicardial signal regulating myocardial growth and differentiation.',\n",

Formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and FPR-like receptor (FPRL)1, two G protein-coupled receptors belonging to the FPR family, play an essential role in host defense mechanisms against bacterial infection and in the regulation of inflammatory reactions. FPRL2, the third member of this structural family of chemoattractant receptors, is characterized by its specific expression on monocytes and DCs. Here, we present the isolation from a spleen extract and the functional characterization of F2L, a novel chemoattractant peptide acting specifically through FPRL2. F2L is an acetylated amino-terminal peptide derived from the cleavage of the human heme-binding protein, an intracellular tetrapyrolle-binding protein. The peptide binds and activates FPRL2 in the low nanomolar range, which triggers intracellular calcium release, inhibition of cAMP accumulation, and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases through the G(i) class of heterotrimeric G proteins. When tested on monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs, F2L promotes calcium mobilization and chemotaxis. Therefore, F2L appears as a new natural chemoattractant peptide for DCs and monocytes, and the first potent and specific agonist of FPRL2.',\n",

Here we identify a novel neuropeptide of 36 amino-acid residues in rat brain as an endogenous ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor FM-4/TGR-1, which was identified to date as the neuromedin U (NMU) receptor, and designate this peptide 'neuromedin S (NMS)' because it is specifically expressed in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. NMS shares a C-terminal core structure with NMU. The NMS precursor contains another novel peptide. NMS mRNA is highly expressed in the central nervous system, spleen and testis. In rat brain, NMS expression is restricted to the core of the SCN and has a diurnal peak under light/dark cycling, but remains stable under constant darkness. Intracerebroventricular administration of NMS in rats activates SCN neurons and induces nonphotic type phase shifts in the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity. These findings suggest that NMS in the SCN is implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms through autocrine and/or paracrine actions.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We previously reported that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A(165) inflammatory effect is mediated by acute platelet-activating factor synthesis from endothelial cells upon the activation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and its coreceptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). In addition, VEGF-A(165) promotes the release of other endothelial mediators including nitric oxide and prostacyclin (PGI(2)). However, it is unknown whether VEGF-A(165) is mediating PGI(2) synthesis through VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and/or VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) activation and whether the coreceptor NRP-1 potentiates VEGF-A(165) activity. In this study, PGI(2) synthesis in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) was assessed by quantifying its stable metabolite (6-keto prostaglandin F(1alpha), 6-keto PGF(1alpha)) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment of BAEC with VEGF analogs, VEGF-A(165) (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and NRP-1 agonist) and VEGF-A(121) (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonist) (up to 10(-9) m), increased PGI(2) synthesis by 70- and 40-fold within 15 min. Treatment with VEGFR-1 (placental growth factor and VEGF-B) or VEGFR-2 (VEGF-C) agonist did not increase PGI(2) synthesis. The combination of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 agonists did not increase PGI(2) release. Pretreatment with a VEGFR-2 inhibitor abrogated PGI(2) release mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121), and pretreatment of BAEC with antisense oligomers targeting VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 mRNA reduced PGI(2) synthesis mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121) up to 79%. In summary, our data demonstrate that the activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 heterodimer (VEGFR-1/R-2) is essential for PGI(2) synthesis mediated by VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-A(121), which cannot be reproduced by the parallel activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 homodimers with corresponding agonists. In addition, the binding of VEGF-A(165) to NRP-1 potentiates its capacity to promote PGI(2) synthesis.',\n",
