### Ligand-Receptor Interaction Modelling 

ConnectomeDB models all ligand receptor pairs as simplex directional interactions.

For heteromeric receptors and ligands, connectomeDB splits complexes into simplex pairs. E.g. IFNB1 which binds to the IFNAR1:IFNAR2 complex is modelled as two separate pairs IFNB1 ○ ⤚ IFNAR1 and  IFNB1 ○ ⤚ IFNAR2. Similarly, for a heteromeric ligand TNFSF13:TNFSF13B binding to TNFRSF17 would be split into TNFSF13 ○ ⤚ TNFRSF17 and TNFSF13B ○ ⤚ TNFRSF17.

In the case of bidirectional signalling where signals are triggered in both cells the pair is modelled as two directional interactions. E.g. CD28 ⤙ ⤚ CD86 and CD86 ⤙ ⤚ CD28.\
The current version of connectomeDB does not model signalling via non-peptide ligands.

### Incorporation of Existing LR Pairs

Protein ligand mediated ligand-receptor pairs from our previous database releases (connectomeDB2015 and 2020) and other databases including CellTalkDB, ICELLNET_v2, CellChatDB_v2, CellPhoneDB_v5 and LIANA_consensus were downloaded (and frozen May 2025). Non-protein ligands were removed and the complex pairs present in ICELLNET_v2, CellCHatDB_v2, CellPhoneDB_v5 and LIANA_consensus were split into singlet pairs (see `Ligand-Receptor Interaction Modelling`) for manual curation.

### Identification of Putative New LR Pairs

Multiple strategies were used to identify novel ligand–receptor (LR) pairs. Initially, we conducted non-exhaustive manual searches of abstracts using keywords such as ligand and receptor, and collected candidate pairs encountered over the past five years.

This process was significantly accelerated using prompt-based queries to large language models. First, a model such as ChatGPT or SciBERT—trained on abstracts and titles from ConnectomeDB2020—was used to identify new articles describing LR interactions. Second, Perplexity AI was employed to perform an exhaustive reciprocal search: (i) identifying receptors that bind to each known ligand in our database, and (ii) ligands that bind to each known receptor.

All candidate pairs were parsed to extract gene symbols, and only those representing valid gene pairs not already present in ConnectomeDB2020 were retained for manual validation.

### Manual Curation of Ligand–Receptor Triplets

Each interaction in ConnectomeDB is recorded as a triplet: ligand symbol : receptor symbol : PubMed ID. Only interactions supported by primary experimental evidence are included; literature reviews are excluded, as they often overgeneralise (e.g. “Eph receptors interact with ephrins”) without specifying direct evidence for individual pairs.

For entries from existing databases with a PubMed ID, a single curator manually assessed the cited article. If it contained primary evidence for the interaction, the triplet was retained in ConnectomeDB2025.
For interactions lacking primary evidence—due to incorrect, retracted or missing PubMed IDs, review-only citations, or newly identified pairs (via manual or AI-assisted searches)—two independent curators conducted manual literature searches. One curator identified a candidate publication, and a second curator independently verified whether it provided valid primary evidence. If there was disagreement, a third expert curator acted as a tie-breaker to determine inclusion.

### Subcellular localization

The sub-cellular localization of ligands and receptors were annotated using Perplexity, Uniprot, The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and manual confirmation. For HPA data, only localization information with "Enhanced", "Supported", or "Approved" reliability was considered; sublocation entries marked as "Uncertain" were excluded.

The vast majority of pairs involve ligands that are secreted or on the plasma membrane of the sending cell, interacting with a receptor on the plasma membrane of the receiving cell.

Note connectomeDB also incorporates some non-canonical pairs that are worth mentioning.

The PENK ○ ⤚ OGFR pair involves interaction of an endogenous opioid peptide (OGF processed from PENK) that binds to OGFR which is localised to the nuclear membrane.

The S100A1 ○ ⤚ TLR4 pair involves interaction of S100A1 which is normally intracellular but released via non-canonical means upon cellular stress or damage.

### Orthologous pairs

Within connectomeDB2025 there are 3,436 ligand-receptor pairs linked to human gene symbols and 12 mouse specific pairs linked to mouse gene symbols. Human and mouse gene symbols were mapped to HGNC and MGI identifiers respectively. Expand...
